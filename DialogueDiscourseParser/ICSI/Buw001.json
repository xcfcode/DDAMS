are seeing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if you have", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or you shou could tell people not to use the boards .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but there 's this missing information otherwise .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we sh we should", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "agree , but you just you end up with video ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and instrumented rooms .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and that 's different project , .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "for this data capture , it would be to have digital camera", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "just to take pictures of who 's there ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "where the microphones are ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then we could also put in what 's on the board .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "like three or four snaps for every", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "people who were never at the meeting will have very hard time understanding it otherwise .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for every meeting .",

who were at the meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no . , think , that now we don't make record of where people are sitting on the tables .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and that the at some point that might be awfully useful .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but adding photographs adds whole nother level of problems .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's just digital record .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "not not as part of the not as part of the data that you have to recover .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "don't mean that you model it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just just in terms of", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "like archiving it or storing it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , agree .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "it 's because discourse is about things ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and then you have the things that are about , and it 's recoverable .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "someone later might be able to take these and say \" , they , at least these are the people who were there", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and here 's what they started talking about ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it 's so simple .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "like you said , three snapshots", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "just to archive .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "liz , you sa you sat in on the , , subcommittee meeting or whatever", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "on you on the subcommittee meeting for at the , that workshop we were at that , , mark liberman was having .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so wasn't there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they they must have had some discussion about video and the visual aspect , and all that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "big , big interest .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it personally , don't would never want to deal with it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but 'm just saying first of all there 's whole bunch of fusion issues that darpa 's interested in .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "fusing gesture and face recognition ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "even lip movement and things like that ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for this task .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and there 's also personal interest on the part of mark liberman in this in storing these images in any data we collect", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that later we can do other things with it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so so to address what adam 's saying ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the key thing there is that this is description of database collection effort that they 're talking about doing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if the database exists and includes some visual information that doesn't mean that an individual researcher is going to make any use of it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that it 's gonna be lot of effort on our part to create it , and store it ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and get all the standards , and to do anything with it .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so we 're gonna", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we 're gonna do what we 're gonna do ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "whatever 's reasonable for us .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "even doing something very crude", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like know with atis , we just had tape recorder running all the time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and later on it turned out it was really good that you had tape recorder of what was happening ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "even though you you just got the speech from the machine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if you can find some really , , low , , perplexity ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "way of doing that , it would be worthwhile .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if it 's simple as , as simple as just the digital", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "otherwise you 'd you lose it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "minimally , , what dan is referring to at least having some representation of the the spatial position of the people ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "cuz we are interested in some spatial processing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "once the room is little more fixed that 's little easier", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "also cmu has been doing this", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and they were the most vocal at this meeting ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "alex waibel 's group .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and they have said , talked to the student who had done this , that with two fairly

{"text": "so we would be we might lose the chance to use this data for somebody later who wants to do some processing on it if we don't collect it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that if you have that , then people who are interested in vision can use this database . the problem with it is you 'll have more people who don't want to be filmed than who don't want to be recorded .", "speaker": "G"},

"but she 's we 're just proposing minimal preservation of things on boards ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "definitely won't participate if there 's camera .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you could anonymize the faces for that matter .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "but , , that 's lot of infrastructure and work .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we can talk about the", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "to set it up and then anonymize it ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's just one snapshot .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "no , it wa not ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , no , no .", "speaker": "A"},

crude set - up .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they just turn on these cameras .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they were they were not moving or anything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "couldn't find it ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and stored it on analog media .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and they didn't actually align it or anything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they just they have it , though .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's worth considering .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "we don't want to spend that much more time discussing it ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "did they store it digitally ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "or just put it on videotape ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "they just had the videotapes with , counter .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for , for our purposes we probably will", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we might try that some", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we certainly already have some recordings that don't have that ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which , , we 'll we 'll get other value out of , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it 's easy to collect it then it 's wise thing to do", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "because once it 's gone .", "speaker":

probably be some video data in there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so that could argue for us not doing it", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or it could argue for us doing it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the only place where it overlaps is when some of the summarization issues are actually could be , , easier made easier if you had the video .",

silly to collect it all and not look at it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so that we do have to do some picking and choosing of the that we 're doing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but am int do think that we minimally want something we might want to look at some , , subsets of that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like for meeting like this , at least , , take polaroid of the of the of the boards ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "of the board .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or at least make that the note - taker takes sh , snapshot of the board .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and know the position of the people", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 'll make it lot easier for meetings that are structured .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "otherwise later on if nobody wrote this on the board down we 'd have harder time summarizing it or agreeing on summary .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "especially since this is common knowledge .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "this is shared knowledge among all the participants ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and it 's shame to keep it off the recording .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "er , if we weren't recording this , this would get lost . ?", "speaker":

"what do you mean we 're not saving it anyway ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'ve written all of this down and it 's getting emailed to you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you 're gonna send it out by email , too .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", in that case we don't need to take pictures of it .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that would be the other alternative , to make that anything that was on the board , , is in the record .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's why that 's why 'm saying that the note - taking would be", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in many for many meetings there will be some note - taking ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in which case , that 's useful thing to have", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", we , we don't need to require it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it would be if we try to get picture with every meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we won't worry about requiring these things ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the more things that we can get it for , the more useful it will be for various applications .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , , departing for the moment from the data collection question but actually talking about , , this group and what we actually want to do ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that 's the way what you were figuring on doing was was , , putting together some notes and sending them to everybody", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so so the question that we started with was whether there was anything else we should do during during the collection .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the crosspads was certainly one idea ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we 'll get them from him and we 'll just do that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then the next thing we talked about was the was the summaries", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and are we gonna do anything about that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "before we leave the crosspads and call it done .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , if 'm collecting data then there is this question of do use crosspads ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , that if we really have me collect data and 't use crosspads , it 's probably less useful for you to go to the trouble of using it ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "unless you think that the crosspads are gonna", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'m not 'm not what they 're gonna do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but but having small percentage of the data with it ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'m not whether that 's useful or not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's no big deal .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we just do it and see what happens .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the point was to try again , to try to collect more information that could be useful later for the ui .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it 's landay supplying it", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that landay 's can be easier to do .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it now he 's operating from zero ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so even if we didn't get it done from uw , it seems like that would could still you shou", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "at least try it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 'd be useful to have small amount of it just as proof of concept .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what you can do with things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and and they seem to not be able to give enough of them away ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so we could probably get more as .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but not to rely on them for basic modeling .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's true .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if it if it seems to be really useful to you , we could probably get donation to me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it it will again depend on landay ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and if he has student who 's interested ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and how much infrastructure we 'll need .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "if it 's easy , we can just do it .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but if it requires lot of our time , we probably won't do it .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "lot of the we 're doing now really is pilot", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in one sense or another .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", we have to figure out what we 're gonna do .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and so we try it out and see how it works .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "wouldn't base any of the modeling on having those .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ag agree with that .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "though , the importance marking is good idea , though .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that if people have something in front of them", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that shouldn't be hard for", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do it on pilots or laptops .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "if something 's important everyone clap .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so crosspads , we 're just gonna try it and see what happens .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", that 's .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "the note - taking", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , that this is gonna be useful .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if we record data will definitely ask for it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , we should just say this is not we don't want to put any extra burden on people , but if they happen to generate minutes , could they send it to us ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ". that 's fine .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "what was gonna say is that don't want to ask people to do something they wouldn't normally do in meeting .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's ver want to keep away from the artificiality .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "if they exist .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and then jane 's idea of summarization afterward is not bad one .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "picking out to let you pick out keywords ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and , , construct queries .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so who does this summarization ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "people in the meeting .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "just at the end of the meeting , before you go ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "without hearing each other though , probably .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "go around the table .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "or even just have one or two people stay behind .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "people with radio mikes can go into separate rooms and continue recording without hearing each other .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's the thing .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "then you should try them few weeks later", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they have all these memory experiments about how little you actually retain", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and see score them ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 's the interesting thing , though .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if we do if we collect four different summaries , , we 're gonna get all this weird data about how people perceive things differently .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's like this is not what we meant to research .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that could be very interesting .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "but but again , like the crosspads , don't would base lot of on it ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how you would do it , though .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "because know when see the clock coming near the end of the meeting , 'm like inching towards the door .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you 're probably not gonna get lot of people wanting to do this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is email easier ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "when you first said do it , , spoken , what was thinking is , then people have to come up", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and you have to hook them up to the recorder .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so , if they 're already here that 's good ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but if they 're not already here for 'd rather do email .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "'m much faster typing than anything else .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "'d just try , however the least intrusive and quickest way is ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and and closest to the meeting time too ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "cuz people will start to forget it as soon as they leave .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "that doing it orally at the end of the meeting is the best time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because they 're captive audience .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "once they leave ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "read the digits ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "do the summary .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but , , don't think that they 'll necessarily you 'll get many people willing to stay .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , , if you get even one", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's like the note - taking thing ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that that you can't certainly can't require it", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or people aren't gonna want to do this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but but if there 's some cases where they will , then it would be helpful .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text":
