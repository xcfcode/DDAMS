been looking at the prm .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , this is , like the latest thing have on it ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "sorta constructed couple of classes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like , user class , site class , and , time , route , and then and query class .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and tried to simplify it down little bit ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that actually , look at it more .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's the same paper that gave to jerry last time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so took out lot of , lot of the decision nodes ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then tried to", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the red lines on the , , graph are the , relations between the different , classes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like , user has like , query ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then , also has , , reference slots to its preferences ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the special needs and , , money , and the user interest .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is more or less similar to the flat bayes - net that have , , with the input nodes and all that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so tried to construct the dependency models ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "lot of these got from the flat bayes - net ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and what they depend on ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it turns out , , the cpt 's are really big , if do that ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so tried to see how do , put in the computational nodes in between .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and what that would look like in prm .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so ended up making several classes", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "actually , , class of with different attributes that are the intermediate nodes ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and one of them is like , time affordability money affordability , site availability , and the travel compatibility .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so some of these classes are", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "some of these attributes only depend on from , say , the user ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or just from , , like the site .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like , , these here ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's only like , user ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , if you look at travel compatibility for each of these factors , you need to look at pair of , , what the , preference of the user is", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "versus , , what type of an event it is ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or , which form of transportation the user has", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and whether , , the onsite parking matters to the user , in that case .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that makes the scenario little different in prm ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because , , then you have one - user objects", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and potentially you can have many different sites in mind .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for each of the site you 'll come up with this rating , of travel compatibility .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , they all depend on the same users , but different sites ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'m tr wa have been trying to see whether the prm would make it more efficient if we do inferencing like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you end up having fewer number of nodes than in flat bayes - net ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "cuz otherwise you would", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's probably the same .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , you would definitely have", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "be able to re - use , like , , all the user ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and not having to recompute lot of the ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because it 's all from the user side .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if you changed sites , you can , , save some work on that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in the case where , it depends on both the user and the site , then 'm still having hard time trying to see how , using the prm will help .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so anyhow , using those intermediate nodes then , this would be the class that represent the intermediate nodes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that would it 's just another class in the model ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "with , , references to the user and the site and the time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then , after you group them together this", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no the dependencies would of the queries would be reduced to this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so , , it 's easier to specify the cpt and all .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that 's about as far as 've gone on the prm .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you didn't yet tell us what the output is .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so what decisions does this make ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so it only makes two decisions , in this model .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and one is how desirable site is", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "meaning , , how good it matches the needs of user .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the other is the mode of the visit ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "whether it 's the eva decision .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , instead of , doing lot of , , computation about , , which one site it wants of the user wants to visit , 'll come , try to come up with like , list of sites .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and for each site , , where how it fits ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and rating of how it fits and what to do with it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "anything else missed ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that was pretty quick .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "she 's ac eva 's got little write - up on it", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that , probably gives the details to anybody who needs them .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the you you didn't look yet to see if there 's anybody has implementation .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "no , not yet ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so one so one of the questions , , about these ms is", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we aren't gonna build our own interpreter ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so if we can't find one , then we , go off and do something else and until one appears .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so one of the things that eva 's gonna do over the next few weeks is see if we can track that down .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the people at stanford write papers as if they had one ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but , , we 'll see .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so anyway . so that 's major open issue .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "if there is an interpreter , it looks like , what eva 's got should run", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and we should be able to actually , try to solve , , the problems ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "to actually take the data , and do it .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and we 'll see .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "actually is cleaner ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and the ability to instantiate , , instance of people and sites and , , will help in the expression .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "whether the inference gets any faster or not .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it wouldn't surprise me if it if it doesn't .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's the same information .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "there are things that you can express this way which you can't express in normal belief - net ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "without going to some incredible hacking", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "of rebuilding it on the fly .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the notion of instantiating your el elements from the ontology and fits this very nicely and doesn't fit very into the extended belief - net .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so that was one of the main reasons for doing it .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , , people who have thought about the problem , like robert", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it looked to me like if eva were able to come up with , value for each of number of , sites plus its eva thing ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that travel planner should be able to take it from there .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and , with some other information about how much time the person has and whatever ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and then plan route .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "- , , , first of all , looks , mu much cleaner ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "nnn , nnn ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "certain certain beauty in it ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , , if beauty is truth , then , we 're in good shape .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as , , mentioned before we probably should look at the details .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if you have write - up then , 'd love to read it", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you go all the way back to the very top ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "these @ @ these when these are instantiated they take on the same values ? that we had before ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'t really see the whole thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or are they have they changed , in sense ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "leave them to similar things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "some of the things might that might be different , like are that the hours for the site .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , eventually that to mean whether they 're open at this hour or not .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and status would be , , more or less like , whether they 're under construction ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and or like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the , , other question would have is that presumably , from the way the stanford people talk about it , you can put the probabilities also on the relations .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is the structural uncertainty ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that was actually in the previous the ubenth .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "don't remember whether they carried that over to this or not ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's in the definition or in the in daphne 's definition of prm", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that classes and relations ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you 're gonna have cpt 's over the classes and their relations .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "more uncertainty , or", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "remember them learning when , , you the structure for ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but don't remember reading how you specify", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that would be exactly my question .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wh to start with .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , , the plan is when daphne gets back , we 'll get in touch", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and supposedly , , we 'll actually get deep connected to their work", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "somebody 'll , if it 's group meeting once week probably someone 'll go down and , whatever .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , we 'll actually figure all this out .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "then the long term perspective is pretty clear .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we get rocking and rolling on this again , once we get package ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if , when , and how ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then this becomes foregrounded", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "focused , again .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "until then we 'll come up with something that 's @ @ that 's way more complicated for you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because this was laughingly easy ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "actually had to take out lot of the complicated ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "cuz made it really complicated in the beginning ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and jerry was like , \" this is just too much \" .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you could , from this , go on and say suppose there 's group of people traveling together", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and you wanted to plan something that somehow , with some pareto optimal , , thing for", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that 's good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's definitely job for artificial intelligence .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "except for humans can't really solve it either , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's not even something humans", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's the that would be , you could sell it , as", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "you don't have to fight about this , just give your preferences to the", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and then you can blame the computer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but what does it would pote potential result be to split up and never talk to each other again ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that should be one of them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 'd be .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so . so there there are some , , , elaborations of this", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that you could try to put in to this structure ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but don't 's worth it now .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because we 're gonna see what else what else we 're gonna do .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's good ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and there were couple other ideas of , things for eva to look at", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "in the interim .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "good . then , we can move on and see what andreas has got out his sleeve .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or andy , for that matter ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , , for having me here , first of all .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so just little background on my visit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , , 'm not really involved in any project , that 's that 's relevant to you , at the moment ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the reason is really for me , to have an opportunity to talk to some other researchers in the field .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and and so 'll just give you real quick introduction to what 'm working on ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , hope that you have some comments", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or , you 're interested in it to find out more ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so 'll be , happy to talk to you", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , 'd also like to find out some more", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and 'll just walk around the office", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then and ask some questions , , in couple days .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so 'll be here for , tomorrow and then , the remainder of , next week .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , , what started looking at , , to begin with is just , content management systems , in general .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what 's the state of the art there is to you have bunch of documents or learning units or learning objects ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you store meta - data , associate to them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so there 's some international standards", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like the - triple - , there 's an - triple - , lon standard ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , these fields are pretty straightforward , you have author information , you have , size information , format information and so on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but they 're two fields that are , more interesting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one is you store keywords associated with the with the document ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and one is , you have , ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what is the document about ? so it 's some taxonomic , ordering of the of the units .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now , if you put on your semantic glasses , you say , that 's not all that easy ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because there 's an implicit , , assumption behind that", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is that , all the users of this system share the same interpretation of the keyword and the same interpretation of , whichever taxonomy is used ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's that 's very that 's key point of these systems", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they always brush over this real quickly without really elaborating much of that", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , the only thing that really works out so far are library ordering codes ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which are very , very coarse grain ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you have some like , science , biology , and then", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that 's really all that we have at the moment .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so there 's huge , , need for improvement there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now , what this standard like this would give us is we could , with search engine just query , different repositories all over the world .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we can't really", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what 'm what try to do is , to have ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so . so the scenario is the following , you 're working on some project and you encounter certain problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now , what we have at our university quite bit is that , students , try to program certain assignment , ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they always run into the same problems ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they always come running to us ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they 'll say why 's it not it 's not working ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we always give out the same answer ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we thought , , it 'd be to have system that could take care of this ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so , what want to build is smart system .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now , what you need to do here is you need to provide some context information", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which is more elaborate than \" 'm looking for this and this keyword . \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that don't need to tell you this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'m 'm you have the same when somebody utters sentence in certain , , context", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it , and the same sentence in another context makes huge difference .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , want to be able to model information like , , so in the in the context of developing distributed systems , of at computer science school ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what software is the person using ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which homework assignment is he or she working on at the moment ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what 's the background of that student 's", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which error message was encountered .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this information should be transmitted , , when certain document is retrieved .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we somehow need to have formalized , way of writing this down ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that 's where the shared interpretation of certain terms and keywords comes in again .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , using this and some , knowledge about the domain you can do some simple inferences .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like that when somebody 's working about , working on servlets ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "he 's using java , cuz servlets are used are written in java .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so some inferences like that ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now , , using this you can infer more information ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you could then match this to the meta - data of off the documents you 're you 're searching against .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , what wanna do is have some given these inputs ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then compute how many documents match ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and use this as metric in the search .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now , what plan to do is want to do try to improve the quality of the search results ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and want to do this by having depth , steepest descent approach .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if knew which operating system the person was working on , would this improve my search result ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and and having , symbolic formalized model of this could simply compute that ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and find out which which questions are worth , asking .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that 's what then propagate back to the user ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and try to optimize the search in this way .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now , the big problem that 'm facing now is , it 's fairly easy to hack up system quickly , that works in the small domain ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the problem is the scalability .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , so robert was mentioning , earlier today is that , microsoft with their printer set up program has bayesian network ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which does exactly this ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but there you face problem that these are very hard to extend .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so , what 'm what try to do is try to model this , in way that you could really combine , knowledge from very different sources ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , looking into some of the ideas that the semantic web community , came up with .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "trying to have , an approach how to integrate certain representation of certain concepts and also some computational rules ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what you can do with those .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what 'm also looking into is probabilistic approach into this", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because document retrievals is very fuzzy procedure ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it 's probably not that easy to simply have symbolic , computational model .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that that probably isn't expressive enough .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so . so that 's another thing ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which you 're also , looking into now .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then , as an add - on to this whole idea , , that would be", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now , depending on what the search engine or the content repository depending on which , , which , rules and which ontologies it uses , or its view of the world , you can get very different results .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it might ma make lot of sense to actually query lot of different search engines .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and there you could have an idea where you actually have peer to peer approach ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "where we 're all carrying around our individual bookshelves ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , if you have question about homework , it 's probably makes sense to ask somebody who 's in your class with you , the guru in the certain area ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "rather than going to some yahoo - like , search engine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so these are some of the just in nutshell , some of the ideas .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and lot of the even though it 's it 's very different domain , but lot of the , , issues are fairly similar .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so some of the how much about the larger heidelberg project ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "know , know abou about it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it seems like lot of some of the issues are the same .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's like , , , the context - based factors that influence how you interpret ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "- . - .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how to interpret .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in in this case , infer in knowing wanting to kinds of things to ask .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we - we 've talked about that ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we haven't worried too much about that end of the discourse .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you had that in the previous models .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in in one one mmm , small difference in in way , is that he doesn't have to come up with an answer ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but he wants to point to the places", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "documents that have the answers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so . so 'm 'm not building an expert", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "want to build smart librarian ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that can point you to the reference .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't wanna compute the answer ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it 's little bit easier for me .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", you have to still understand what the content says about itself , and then match it to what you think the informational needs", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you also don't have to figure out what the content is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you 're just taking the keywords as topic text ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "assume that the there will be learning systems that tag their content .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "@ @ and what what envision is that you rather than just supplying bunch of keywords you could for an faq you could state like logic condition , when this document applies .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so \" this document explains how to set up your , mail account on linux \" like this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so . so something very specific that you can then", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the that the key point with these , learning systems is that , learning system is only as good as the amount of content it carries .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can have the best learning system with the best search interface ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if there 's no content inside of it , it 's not very useful .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so ultimately because , developing these rules and these inference inferences is very costly ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , you must be able to reuse some existing , domain information , or or ontologies that other people wrote", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then try to integrate them ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then also search the entire web , rather than just the small , content management system .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that 's that 's crucial for the success of or @ @", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , you 're not", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'m trying to figure out how it maps to the kinds of things that we 've talked about in this group , and , actually associated groups ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "cuz some of us do pretty detailed linguistic analyses ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and 'm guessing that you won't be doing that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , you take the query , and", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "on the other hand , , framenet could be useful .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so do the framenet story ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "not too much ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "- that 's another thing you might wanna look into while you 're here .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "have rough overview .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because , , , the standard story is that keyworks keywords evoke frames , and the frames may give you additional keywords", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "or , if that that bunch of keywords , indicate frame , then you can find documents that actually have the whole frame , rather than just , individual", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "mmm . mmm .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so there 's lot of ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and people are looking at that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "most of the work here is just trying to get the frames .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "there 's linguists and", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and there 's lot of it", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and they 're they 're busily working away .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but there are some application efforts trying to exploit it .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and this looks it seems to be that this is place where you might be able to do that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "'m could learn lot about , , just how to how to come up with these structures ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "cuz it 's it 's very easy to whip up something quickly ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it then makes sense to me , but not to anybody else ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if we want to share and integrate things , they must , they must be designed really .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "remember the , prashant story ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the no linguistic background person that the iu sent over here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and andreas and tried to come up wi or we had come up actually with with him working on an interface for framenet , as it was back then , that would do some of the work for this machine ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which , never got done because prashant found happy occupation", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "know , it he he did what he did was much more sensible for him .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but so 'm just saying , the , we had that idea", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the idea was there . , .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "to exploit framenet there as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and srini 's doing information extraction also ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "with that framenet base .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you never sent anybody else from .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "except except prashant ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this was supposedly an exchange program ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and we , it 's fine . we don't care ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but it just 'm little surprised that , andreas didn't come up with anyone else he wanted to send .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "had forgotten to be honest with you , 'd forgotten we had program .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's in the program ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's it 's really the lack of students , at iu at the moment .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , no . there was whole co there was little contract signed .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": ". it 's ju it 's more the lack of students , really ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we have all these sponsors that are

are being recorded now , so beware .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "didn't say anybody to anything to offend", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "except for the sponsors ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so thi tha that 's that 's one of the things that might be worth looking into while you 're here .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "unfortunately , srini , who is heavily involved in daml and all this is himself out of town .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "'ll go to the , semantic web workshop , , in two weeks .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for some reason he 's not doing that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "he had other things to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "why he @ @", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": ", who knows ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "anyway , , you 'll see you 'll certainly see lot of the people there .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the other person of is dan gildea ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because he did some work on topic spotting", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "st - statistical .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that would be very good idea .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "which is , , you . don't depending on how you wanna integrate with that end ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like , taking the data and fig you said the learning systems that figure out", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we there 's someone in icsi who actually has been working on has worked on that kinda ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and he 's worked with frame net ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you could talk to him about , , both of those things at once .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "- . - .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and he just finished writing draft of his thesis .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "dan gildea , gildea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , , who is that again ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , he 's in one of the rooms on the fifth floor and ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "take you to his office .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's just around the corner .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you fal solve the problem , hope you can do one for us too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright , was there anything else for this ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "one of these times soon we 're gonna hear about construal .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "have it was november two thousand three or some", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no . wh - had something in my calendar .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's long way away .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "bribe my way out of this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so did some double checking", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it seems like spring break in two thousand one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "talk about changing the topic .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , but he 's he 's as you said , he 's , like the state legislature , he 's trying to offer us bribes .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "at least this is private meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's the link .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this , they refused the budget again ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it so about citris ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we 're , , involved in literally three hundred million dollar , program .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "with the state of california .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and , the state of california is now month and half behind its legis its legally required date to approve budget .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so the budget has not been approved .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and two days ago there 's two , so , two branches of legislature . one branch approved it ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "yesterdayday there was this that the other branch would just approve it ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but now there 's actually little back sliding to people who approved it got flak from there ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "! have to tell you wonderful story about this ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and then we 'll go .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , it turns out wound up having lunch today with guy named tom kalil .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and , , he now works at berkeley .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "he 's hired to run lot of citris ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "even though we don't have the money they so they 've been hiring people and left ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , , they think the money 's coming .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so and he was , , the chief staffer to clinton on technology matters .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "he was in the white house ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "don't remember what he was saying .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "anyway , like that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and , is now doing all the politics for citris ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but also , has , lot of interest in , actually doing things for society ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so digital divide and like that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so that 's interesting to me but not to you .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but the really interesting thing was , he st he said something about , 'm interested in things that have high social multiplier ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "something that is of social value .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "he said , \" \" ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "this was his only example ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "\" if you had adult literacy program that was as good as an individual tutor ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and as compelling as video game ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "then that would have huge social impact \" .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "said , \" ! that 's good problem to work on . \"", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "anyway . so it was that , he 's got this view , of , that 's what you should try to do , and , , language would be good way to do it .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "mmm . definitely .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so anyway , that 's the end of the story .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but for adults and not for the children .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "didn't push him on the ch on the child thing ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "again , if you if you", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and this was this was literacy ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "which actually is somewhat different problem .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so this is reading , rather than teaching", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "another project we started on , and didn't get funded for was , , to try to build an automatic tutoring program , for kids whose first language wasn't english .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "which is like half the school population in california .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "something like that ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "enormous problem in california ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and the idea was if we 're so smart about language understanding and speech understanding , couldn't we build , programs that would be tutors for the kids .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we think we could .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "anyway . so so but this is slightly different problem ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "know none of us have the spare time to look at it now ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but it it 's it 's interesting", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and may , talk to him some more about is somebody already doing this , and like that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so anyway , that was that was today 's little story .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so did manage to get pull my head out of the sling by sidetracking into citris ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but or temporarily putting it out of the sling", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , 'll volunteer to put it back in by stating that am among some other things in the process of writing up that we have been discussing at our daily meetings ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and also

"F"}, {"text": "nnn . sometimes , the sum is not less than the", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "anyway . , so , so that 'd be ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but 'd it 's it 's time again ,", "speaker":
