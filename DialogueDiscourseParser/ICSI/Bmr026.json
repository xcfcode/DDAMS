finally made the tape for the thing that we sent them week or week and half ago", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that 's our system .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that it 's gone out to the transcribers", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and hopefully next week we 'll have the transcription back from that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "can have pen ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "jane seems to be moving along on the transcriptions from the icsi side .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "she 's assigned , probably five or six more meetings .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we 're up to mr thirteen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , she 's hired some new transcribers", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "which meetings is she transcribing ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we 've we 've run out of us because certain number of them are , awaiting to go to ibm .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "for ibm , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the rest are in process being transcribed here .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so does she have transcribers now who are sitting idle because there 's no data back from ibm", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we 're doing some in parallel .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we haven't done that process .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we 're not waiting on them .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so . they ' they 're doing the full transcription process .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so they 're just doing their own thing until", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because need to ask jane whether it 's it would be for her , some of her people to transcribe some of the initial data we got from the smartkom data collection , which is these short like five or seven minute sessions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we 're doing it in

"speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and get it transcribed and get it back .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but to get going we would like some of the data transcribed away so we can get started .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so wanted to ask jane if , , one of their transcribers could do", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "since these are very short , that should really be ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there 's only two channels .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it 's only", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as the synthesis doesn't have to be transcribed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's only two",

"B"}, {"text": "and it 's also not bunch of interruptions with people and all that ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and some of it is read speech , so we could give them the thing that they 're reading", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and they just may", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "make it 's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was gonna ask her but since she 's not around 'll", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if that 's with you to , , get that to ask her for that , then 'll do that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we 're held up on this other little bit in order to encompass that , that 's because , still have high hopes that the ibm pipeline 'll work out for us , so it 's", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", and also related to the transcription ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so 've been trying to keep web page up to date showing what the current status is of the trans of all the things we 've collected", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and what stage each meeting is in , in terms of whether it 's", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "can you mail that out to the list ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "- , will .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that 's the thing that sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and so that 's where 'm putting it but 'll", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "'ll send it out to the list telling people to look at it .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "haven't done that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so . have lots of to add that 's just in my own directory .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'ll try to get to that .",

"speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so but it 's just transcripts , not the not the audio ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "nope , they 'll have access to the audio also .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's my intention .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because the transcripts might not be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you want people to be able to listen to them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , the audio that they 're gonna have access to , will that be the uncompressed version ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "or will you have scripts that like uncompress the various pieces and", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that 's good point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's good point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's it 's probably going to have to be the uncompressed versions because , , it takes too long to do random access decompression .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was just wondering because we 're running out of the un - backed - up disk space on", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that was the other point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was that another one ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that 's another agenda item .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that is good point so we 'll get to that , too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "darpa demo status , not much to say .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the back - end is working out fine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's more or less ready to go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'ve added some that indes indexes by the meeting type mr , edu , et cetera", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and also by the user id .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that the front - end can then do filtering based on that as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the back - end is , going more slowly as said before just cuz 'm not much of tcl - tk programmer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and dave gelbart says he 's little too busy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so don and are gonna work on that and you and just talk about it off - line more .", "speaker": "A"},

something .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wondered whe when we would reach dave 's saturation point .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "he 's been volunteering for everything", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "finally said he was too busy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we reached it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "he actually he volunteered but then he then he retracted it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , also , was just showing andreas , got an waves display ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and how much more we can do with it", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "with like the prosodic where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , now it 's just an waves", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then you have three windows", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but , it looked pretty", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and 'm it has potential for little something ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so again , the issue is for july , the issue 's gonna be what can we fit into windows machine , , and so on ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it might just be slides .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we 'll see ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "'ve been putting together transcriber things for windows", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and installed it on dave gelbart 's pc and it worked just fine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so hopefully that will work .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because there 's some people", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it would be if we could get that to work at sri", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "transcriber is tcl - tk , very generic with snack ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have we have more windows machines to run the", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so anything you can get snack to run on , it will work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but but the problem is the version transcriber works with , the snack version , is one point six whatever", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that 's not anymore supported .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's not on the web page anymore .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but wrote an email to the author of to the snack author", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and he sent me to one point six whatever library", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it was packaged with transcriber ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so it works .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then you can't add our patches", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then the new version is different", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and in , in terms of the source code .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you you can't find the tcl files anymore .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's some whatever wrapped thing", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you can't you can't access that", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you have to install first install tcl then install snack", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then install the transcriber thing", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then do the patches .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wonder if we should contribute our changes back to the authors so that they maintain those changes along", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's just hasn't made it into the release yet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so did you put the the nt version out on the meeting recorder page ? or", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "no , haven't done that yet .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but definitely will do that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , can some of the that don 's talking about somehow fit into this", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "mean you just have set of numbers that are associated with the", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's ascii files or binary files , whatever representation .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's waveform and just stylized pitch vector so it 's", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we could do it in matl - you could do it in number of different places 'm .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but it would be if the transcriber interface had like another window for the , above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary valued function that is that is time synchron ti time synchronous with the wavform .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 'd be very .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 'd be easy enough to add that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "again it 's it 's more tcl -", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so someone who 's familiar with tcl - tk has to do it ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , it wouldn't be hard to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it would almost be like having another waveform displayed .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could look into that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it seems to me that", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it doesn't seem like having that real time is that necessary .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so yo it seems to me you could do images .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what do you mean by real time ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "do you mean like", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "like being able to scroll through it and for the demo .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "is that what you mean ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it just seems to me jus", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it would be to see it", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it would be like to see to hear it and see it ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and to hear it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and see the pitch contours also .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but don't you can do all that just statically in", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just record the audio clip and show an image and that 's", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "thought if you meant slides you meant like just like view graphs .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "no , we 're talking about on the computer", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , when we were talking about this before we had littl this little demo meeting ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we set up range of different degrees of liveness that you could have", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , the more live , the better , but , given the crunch of time , we may have to retreat from it to some extent .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so for lot of reasons , it would be very to have this transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it 'd be good thing to get in there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "anyway , jus just looking for ways that we could actually show what you 're doing , , in to people .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "cuz lot of this , particularly for communicator , certainly significant chunk of the things that we waved our arms about originally had had to do with prosodics", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 'd be to show that we can actually get them and see them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the last item on the agenda is disk issues yet again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , we 're doing on backed up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we 're we 're only about thirty percent on the second disk .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , , we have little bit of time before that becomes critical ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we are like ninety five percent , ninety eight percent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but unfortunately we 're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data all at once , in lot of different ways .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there 's lot of transcribers , too .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "there 're lot of transcribers ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so all of those need to be expanded ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then people are doing chunking and want to do , , the permission forms ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so want those to be live , so there 's lot of data that has to be around .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and jane was gonna talk to , , dave johnson about it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one of the things was thinking is we just got these hundred", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright , excuse me", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ten , sparc - blade sun - blades .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did they come in ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "sun - blades .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "they came in the other day .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "they came in but they 're not set up yet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those because they 'll be in the machine room ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they 'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if we just need un - backed - up space , we could just hang disks off them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "why not just hang them off of abbott ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because there 's no more room in the disk racks on abbott .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "weren't we gonna get", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it should get another rack .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you still need to store the disks somehow .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the sun - blades have spare drive bays .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just put them in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can put two", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "you mean you put them inside the pizza boxes for the", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "cuz the sun , these sun - blades take commodity hard drives .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you can just go out and buy pc hard drive and stick it in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if abbott is going to be our disk server it file server it seems like we would want to get it , , second disk rack .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "plus we 're talking about buying second dis , file server .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there are lots of long term solutions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what 'm looking for is where do we expand the next meeting ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see , see .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for the next meeting you might be out of luck with those ten ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "dave johnson is gone for , like , ten days ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "didn't know he had left already .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you mean he won't set up the", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how much space do you need for these ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "what his schedule is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you we need about gig per meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'m just saying he 's gone .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "what 's your computer 's name ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you had an eighteen gigabyte drive .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's about there 's about twelve gig left .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so it and you have an drives installed ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , didn't realize it was so critical .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and you 're you 're offering ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'m not doing anything on it now until get new meetings to transcri or that are new transcriptions coming in really can't do anything .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "not that 't do anything , jus", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "jus gave thilo some about ten gigs , the last ten gigs of space that there was on abbott .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so but that but", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "which one was that , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's also where we store the the hub - five training set waveforms ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that won't be getting any bigger ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't think that 's on xg .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "on xg is only carmen and du - and stephane 's disk .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but 've also been storing 've been storing the feature files there", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and start deleting some because we now the best features are", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we won't be using the old ones anymore .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have lot of space , though .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "do don't was on xg .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "thats xa that 's", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "isn't that xh ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not not for long .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have lot of space and it 's not it 's", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "there 's very little", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "not for long .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but it 's not going", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's not being used often .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but 'm using xh , too .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's probably probably only about four gig is on on your drive ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we 'll definitely take it up if you", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's xh and", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's about four or five gig", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "cuz have four meetings on there ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "'m also using dg", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "got that confused .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "three or four meetings .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so that will get us through the next couple days .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we need another gigaquad .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there should there should just be should have button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the \" more disk space \" button ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just press press each meeting saying \" we need more disk space \" \" this week \" .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "skip the rest of the conversation .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we 've collected so far something like sixty - five meetings .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and how much does each meeting take ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it 's about gig uncompressed .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's it 's little bit more as usually don't do not uncompress the all of the pzm and the pda things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is little more ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so if you uncompressed everything it 's even more .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "one point five .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "compressed how much are they ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "for all of them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we 're definitely are storing , all of those .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so there 's what", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "thirty some gig of just meetings so far ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so - so so there 's hundred gig .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "cuz we have the uncompressed around also .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it 's like", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we we haven't uncompressed all the meetings ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "would like to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's the they really are cheap .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's just question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but but , we could , if you want to get four disks , get four disks .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's it 's small these things ar are just few hundred dollars .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "sent that message out to , , you and dave asking for if we could get some disk .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "sent this out day ago", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and put it where ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but and dave didn't respond so how the whole process works .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "does he just go out and get them and if it 's , and", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so was assuming he was gonna take over that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but he 's probably too busy given that he 's leaving .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "you need direct conversation with him .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and just say an - just ask him that , , wha what should you do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and in my answer back was \" are you you just want one ? \"", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that what you want to do is plan ahead little bit and figure \" , here 's what we pi figure on doing for the next few months \" .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wa - they want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the sysadmins would prefer to have one external drive per machine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so they don't want to stack up external drives .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then they want everything else in the machine room .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the question is where are you gonna hang them ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what the space situation is in the machine room .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so this is question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to dave ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "part of the reason why dave can't get the new machines up is because he doesn't have room in the machine room now .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "one on - one thing to in to to do when you need to conserve space is", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so he has to re - arrange bunch of .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "bet there are still some old , , like , nine gig disks , , around", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and recover the space .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "dave knows all these things , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "an - and so , he always has lot of plans of things that he 's gonna do to make things better in many ways an and runs out of time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but know that generally their first priority has been for backed up disk .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so what he 's been concentrating on is the back the back up system , rather than on new disk .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but this is very specific question for me .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can easily get one to four disks ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you just go out and get four and we 've got the money for it ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's no big deal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the question is where they go ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and don't think we can solve that here ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you just have to ask him .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can put some disks in the in that back room there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to the machine that collects the data .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so then you could , at least temporarily , store there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's just it 's not on the net , so it 's little awkward", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what do you mean it 's not on the net ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's not bad .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's behind lots of fire walls that don't allow any services through except", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because it 's because it 's an aciri machine ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and also on the list is to get it into the normal icsi net ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but who knows when that will happen ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that can't be that hard .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that might be good short term solution , though .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "no , the problem with that is that they don't currently have wire running to that back room that goes anywhere near one of the icsi routers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , they actually have to run wire somewhere .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "again , , any one of these things is certainly not big deal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if there was person dedicated to doing it they would happen pretty easily but it 's jus every ever everybody has has", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but dave has to do all of them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "all of us have long lists of different things we 're doing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but at any rate that there 's there 's longer

if we did that", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "cuz we get into these other topics .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we feel we feel obligated to collect more data .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if we

probably one of the best", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you and , are the main ones who see the bridge between the two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we are doing recognition in both of them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so so we could talk little bit about that now if there 's some time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , no that would be for next week .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "jus so the latest result was that", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yot tested the the final version of the plp configuration on development test data for this year 's hub - five test set .", "speaker": "D"},

{"text": "definitely not significant .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then the really thing was that if we combine the two systems we get one and half percent improvement .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just with rover ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with - best rover , which is like our new and improved version of rover .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which actually uses the whole - best list from both systems to mmm , combine that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so except the only key difference between the two really is the smoothing at the end which is the auto - regressive versus the cepstral truncation .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but percent and half ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's pretty impressive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so after told the my colleagues at sri about that , , now they definitely want to , , , have", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "next time we have an evaluation they want to do , , at least the system combination .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , , why not ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we clearly gotta add few more features , though .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what do you mean ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "more features in the sense of front - end features or in the sense of just bells and whistles ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , front - end features .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we did plp and mel cepstra .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let 's , , try rasta and msg , and", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , we cou", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's the the", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there 's one thing you don't want to overdo it because every front - end", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you multiply your effort by , where is number of different systems", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so . so one compromise would be to only to have the everything up to the point where you generate lattices be one system", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then after that you rescore your lattices with the multiple systems", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and combine the results and that 's fairly painless thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you think we 'd still get the one and half", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "little less because at that point the error rates are lower", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's only one percent but that would still be worthwhile doing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "jus - , just wanted to let that 's working out very nicely .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then we had some results on digits , , with", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this was really just to get dave going with his experiments .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but as result , , , we were wondering why is the hub - five system doing so on the digits .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the reason is there 's whole bunch of read speech data in the hub - five training set .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "including digits gather , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no it 's actually , digits is only fifth of it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fifth of it is how much ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the rest is read is read timit data and atis data and wall street journal and like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but fi fifth is how much ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "fifth would be two hours something .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that 's actually not that different from the amount of training that there was .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it definitely helps to have the other read data in there", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because we 're doing", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the error rate is half of what you do if you train only on ti timit not timit ti - digits ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which is only what", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "two hours something ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so . , more read speech data definitely helps .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and you can leave out all the conversational data with no performance penalty .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that was the interesting thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because because , it was apparent if you put in bunch more data it would be better ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is there even more read speech data around ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so we only for the hub - five training , we 're only using fairly small subset of the macrophone database .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , you could beef that up and probably do even better .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "could also put in focus condition zero from hub - four from broadcast news , which is mostly prepared speech .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's not exactly read speech but it 's pretty darn close .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's plenty of read speech data .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "wall street journal , , take one example .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , that might be useful for the people who train the digit recognizers to use something other than ti - digits .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they been using timit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they they they experimented for while with bunch of different databases with french and spanish and cuz they 're multilingual tests", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , , and actually the best results they got wa were using timit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but which so that 's what they 're they 're using now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but but certainly if we ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we knew what the structure of what we 're doing there was .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there 's still bunch of messing around with different kinds of noise robustness algorithms .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we exactly which combination we 're gonna be going with .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "once we know , then the trainable parts of it 'd be to run lots of lots of through .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that was that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then chuck and had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem system", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and you wanna you wanna see where that stands ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so andreas brought over the alignments that the sri system uses .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and so 'm in the process of converting those alignments into label files that we can use to train new net with .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and so then 'll train the net .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "an - and one side effect of that would be that it 's that the phone set would change .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the mlp would be trained on only forty - six or forty - eight", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "forty - eight phones ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which is smaller than the than the phone set that we 've been using so far .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that that will probably help , actually ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it 's little different ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because the fewer dimensions the less trouble probably with the as far as just the ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we want to try things like deltas on the tandem features .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so you have to multiply everything by two or three .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so , , fewer dimensions in the phone set would be actually helpful just from logistics point of view .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "although we , it 's not that many fewer and and we take klt anyway so we could", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so so that was the other thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then we wanted to just limit it to something on the same order of dimensions as we use in standard front - end .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that would mean just doing the top ten or twelve of the klt dimensions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and and we sh again check we should check with stephane .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my impression was that when we did that before that had very little he didn't lose very much .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "by just taking the top whatever ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "once we have the new trained up , one thing wanted to try just for the fun of it was to actually run like standard hybrid system that is based on , those features", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and retrain mlp and also the , the dictionary that we use for the hub - five system .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the and the base starting off with the base of the alignments that you got from from pretty decent system .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that would give us , , more hopefully better system", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because , compared to what eric did while ago , where he trained up , , system based on broadcast news", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then tra retraining it on switchboard", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but he he he didn't he probably didn't use all the training data that was available .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and his dictionary probably wasn't as tuned to conversational speech as the as ours is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's that 's certainly one thing , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the dictionary made huge difference .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we we made some improvements to the dictionary 's to the dictionary about two years ago", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which resulted in something like four percent absolute error rate reduction on switchboard ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the other thing is , dipping deep into history and into our resource management days , when we were collaborating with sri before ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it was , it is was really key starting point for us that we actually got our alignment .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "when we were working together we got our initial alignments from decipher , at the time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and . later we got away from it because once we had decent systems going then it was it was typically better to use our own systems", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "cuz they were self consistent", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but certainly to start off when we were trying to recover from our initial hundred and forty percent error rate .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that was that was good good way to start .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we 're not quite that bad with our switchboard systems but it was they certainly aren't as good as sri 's ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what is the performance on the best switchboard system that we 've done ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the hybrid system we never got better than about fifty percent error .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there 's just whole lot of things that no one ever had time for .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we never did really fix up the dictionary .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we always had list of half dozen things that we were gonna do", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and lot of them were pretty simple and we never did .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we never did an never did any adaptation", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we never did any", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that number was on switchboard - one data ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "where the error rate now is in the twenties .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we were probably at least factor or two off .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it would be so it would be good to re", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just at least to give us an idea of how the hybrid system would do .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but again it 's", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's the conver it 's the conversational speech bit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because our broadcast news system is actually pretty good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the other thing that would help us to evaluate is to see how the is trained up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because it 's pretty good indicator of that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it 's sanity check of the outputs before we go ahead and train up the , use them as basis for the tandem system .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 'll still probably be worse .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's it 'd be context independent and so on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "should we should we bother with using the net before doing embedded training ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "should we even use that ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that 's good question .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or should go straight to", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we weren't whether it 's worth to just use the alignments from the recognizer", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or whether to actually go through one or more iterations of embedded training where you realign .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you run it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "keep keep both versions ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see which one 's better ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you would then you proceed with the embedded training .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's gonna take you while to train at this net anyway .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and while it 's training you may as test the one you have and see how it did .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "could make arguments either way .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "given up guessing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but in your experience have you seen big improvements in on some tasks with embedded training ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or was it small - ish improvements that you got", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it depended on the task .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in this one would expect it to be important", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because we 're coming from , alignments that were achieved with an extremely different system .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that are from another", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "although , we 've done it with when we were combining with the cambridge recurrent neural net , embedded training made it worse .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which 've never figured out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's bug .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you started training with outputs from with alignments that were generated by the cambridge system ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", that might probably just", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that was probably because your initial system your system was ba worse than cambridge 's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they were they were comparable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they were very close .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's weird .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's that 's weird .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's what said .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no it 's weird that it did", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's weird that it got worse .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's ambiguous .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "tha - we 've see and wi with the numbers ogi numbers task we 've seen number of times people doing embedded trainings and things not getting better .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "actually it 's not that weird", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because we have seen", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have seen cases where acoustic retraining the acoustic models after some other change made matters worse rather than better .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but would would suspect that something that had very different feature set ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they were using pretty diff similar feature sets to us .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would expect that something that had different feature set would benefit from", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what about hidden unit size on this .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and the other thing ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it was the other thing is that what was in common to the cambridge system and our system is they both were training posteriors .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , , that 's another pretty big difference", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's another big difference .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , one bac at least", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you mean with soft targets ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what 's the key issue here ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that both the cambridge system and our system were training posteriors .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if we 're we 're coming from alignments coming from the sri system , it 's likelihood - based system .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so so that 's another difference .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", there 's diffe different front - end different , , training criterion", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would think that in that an embedded embedded training would have at least good shot of improving it some more .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you gonna say something ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was wondering what size net should", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "anybody have any intuitions or suggestions ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "how much training data ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was gonna start off with the small train set .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and

training ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it 's that 's about mmm , something like thirty hours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "gender - dependent , .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "thirty hours per gender .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'m not what this 'll mean .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in the small training set ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's definitely less than hundred", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's more like thirty forty hours", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "something like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they called to tell us that ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so . . after run", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "didn't want to do too big ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "at least couple thousand hidden units .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's it 's the thing 'll 'll think about it little more", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it 'd be toss up between two thousand and four thousand .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you definitely wouldn't want the eight thousand .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's it 's more than", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and thousand is too small ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "let me think about it ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that at some point there 's diminishing returns .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it doesn't actually get worse , typically ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it but there is diminishing returns", "speaker":

.", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 'll have very tiny effect .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because you used the context windows", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so the input to hidden is much , much larger .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's negligible , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it 's it 'd be way , way less than ten percent of the difference .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how bi how big", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let 's see .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what am trying to think of ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the net that we did use already was eight thousand hidden units",
