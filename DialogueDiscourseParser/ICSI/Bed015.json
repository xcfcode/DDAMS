"speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so so the current syntax is if it if there 's type it 's before construct", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's fine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then it has block that

just an interesting coincidence .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and so was like , \" , both of you don't like it ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's it 's gone .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "fine , we can change it \" .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but 'm starting to like it again .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so that 's why that 's why 'll stick with it .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "if you have

"F"}, {"text": "anyway , so the other the other strategy you could consider is when you what word to put , you could put no word ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the then let", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's true .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so that 's why you put semantic constraints up top and meaning bindings down here ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no . that was just mistake of cut and paste from when was going with it .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , 'm .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "didn't mean that one 's an in unintentional .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so this should be semantic and", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "sometimes 'm intentionally inconsistent", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "cuz 'm not yet .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "here , actually it was just mistake .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "- so this definitely should be \" semantic constraints \" down at the bottom ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "unless go with \" meaning \"", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but , like \" meaning \" better than \" semantic \"", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but there 's vestiges of other people 's biases .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so the middle block doesn't really give you any more information , ex than the top block .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and the bottom block similarly only just illus , all it does is illustrate that you can drop the subscripts and that you can drop the , , that you can give dual types .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "one thing should mention is about \" designates \" .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "'m actually inconsistent across these as .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , , strike out the subscript on the middle block .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so now , , this is actually this little change actually goes along with big linguistic change ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "which is that \" designates \" isn't only something for the semantics to worry about now .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so we want \" designates \" to actually know one of the constituents which acts like head in some respects", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but is , , really important for say composition later on .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , if some other construction says , , \" are you of type is this part of type whatever \" , , the \" designates \" tells you which part is the meaning part .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so if you have like \" the big red ball \" , , you wanna there 's an object or noun .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "ball is going to be the designated element of that phrase .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "there is slight complication here which is that when we talk about form it 's useful sometimes to talk about , to talk about there also being designated object", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and we think that 'll be the same one , ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so the ball is the head of the phrase ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "\" the the \" , , \" big red ball \" ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and the entity

"and , , you might be able to say things like if the head has to go last in head - final language , you can refer to the head as the , the formal head as opposed to the rest of the form having to be at the end of that decision .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so that 's useful thing", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so that you can get some internal structural constraints in .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so looks good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "were you finished ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there was list of things that isn't included", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but you can you can ask question .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that might @ @ it .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , if understand this the", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "aside from , , construed and all that , the differences are mainly that , we 've gone to the possibility of having form - meaning pairs for type", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or actually gone back to ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we go back far enough", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "except for their construction meaning ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so it 's not clear that ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "now it 's contr construction type and meaning type .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so what form type is .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that 's fine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and previous , , , version of the notation certainly allowed you to single out the meaning bit by it .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so you could say \" construct of type whatever designates something \" .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but that was mostly for reference purposes ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "just to refer to the meaning pole .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "don't think that it was often used to give an extra meaning const type constraint on the meaning ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "which is really what we want most of the time .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "if we 'll ever have case where we actually", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "if there is form category constraint , you could imagine having triple there that says , that 's weird .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "no , no , don't .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that you 'll you 'll do fine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "these are , ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as long as mark isn't around , these are form constraints .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so nominal expression is , the fact that it 's animate , is semantic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the fact that it 's , nominal expression would say on most people 's notion of , higher form types , this this is one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that 's just fine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which is fine , .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's that now , , 'm mentioned this ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if ever explained this", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but the point of , ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "mentioned in the last meeting , the point of having something called \" nominal expression \" is , ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because it seems like having the verb subcategorize for , , like say taking as its object just some expression which , , designates an object or designates thing , or whatever , , that leads to some syntactic problems ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so you wanna , you have this problem like \" , , 'll put the word \" , , let 's say , the word \" dog \" ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and that has to come after the verb", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "cuz we know verb meets its object .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then we have construction that says , , you can have \" the \" preceding noun .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and so you 'd have this problem that the verb has to meet the designatum .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and you could get , , \" the kicked dog \" like that , meaning \" kicked the dog \" .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so you have to let this phrase idea in there", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that have no problem with it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's fine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you may be you may not be like everyone else in berkeley ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but that 's .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we we thought we were getting away with , with ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we don't mind either ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "this is not reverting to the - bar theory of phrase structure .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "know that this is like , we didn't originally have in mind that , that verbs would subcategorize for particular form .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but they do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but they does .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "there 's an alternative to this", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "at least in english .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "which is , the question was did we want directed motion ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "which is an argument structure construction", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "did we want it to worry about , , anything more than the fact that it , , has semantic", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's frame - based construction .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so one option that , , keith had mentioned also was like , if you have more abstract constructions such as subject , predicate , things like grammatical relations ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "those could intersect with these", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "in such way that subject , predicate , or subject , predicate , subject , verb , ob , verb object would require that those things that fill subject and object are nom expressions .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and that would be little bit cleaner in some way .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but , for now , ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but it it 's , just moving it moving the the cons the constraints around .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "moving it to another place , .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but there does , there has to be that constraint somewhere , ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and so that was the", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "robert 's not happy now ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and going with that is that the designatum also now is pair .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "instead of just the

{"text": "so , , the mental space thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", construal is is big component of that", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this probably not worth trying to do anything till he

{"text": "so there was one question that came out .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "hate this thing .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so something like \" past \" which , we very simple , we 've often just

"speaker": "F"}, {"text": "whereas past is very conventionalized one", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and we it means", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but it we doesn't don't necessarily want to , , unload

{"text": "but it did one implication it does have for the other side , which we 'll get to in minute is that couldn't think of good way to say \" here are the possible things that you could focus on \" ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "cuz it seems like any entity in any sentence , , or any meaning component of anyth all the possible meanings you could have , any of them could be the subject of

{"text": "li - , , the best thing come up with is that information has list of focused elements .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "you , one other type that forgot to mention is like query elements", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and that 's probably relevant for the like \" where is \" , , \" the castle \" thing ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because you might want to say that , , location or cert certain wh words bring , automatically focus in , , \" the identity of this thing \" way on certain elements .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "anyway . so that 's onl there are there are many more things

adjective .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we should have put an example of this", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and we could do that later .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but the not inherently like the general principles still work though ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that , , we can have constructions that have constituent structure in that there is like , , , one", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": ", they have constituents , ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so you can like nest things when you need to ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but they can also overlap in flatter way .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so if you don't have like lot of grammar experience , then like this might , , be little opaque .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but , , we have the properties of dependency grammars and some

.", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "say two things about the", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you want to forget stress .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , as just don't don't think about it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what 's that ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "canonically speaking you can if you look at curve over sentence , you can find out where certain stress is", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and

"speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because , , as form cue , , not even trained experts can always , they can tell you where the focus exponent is sometimes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that 's also mostly true for read speech .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in in real speech , , people may put stress .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's so context dependent on what was there before , phrase ba

to say let 's worry about specifying the information structure focus of the sentence", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "believe you , .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "ways that you can get it come from", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "hhh , the phonology component can handle actually assigning an intonation contour to that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": ", later on we 'll worry about exactly how",

you 're focus is then you 're you 're hopeless - - ly lost anyways ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's fine , .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and the only way of figuring out what that is , is , , by generating all the possible alternatives to each focused element , decide which one in that context makes sense and which one doesn't .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then you 're left with couple three .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , , again , that 's something that humans can do ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but far outside the scope of any anything .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text":

"but here 's what is going on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that if we do the constructions when particular construction matches , it the fact that it matches , does specify the focus .", "speaker":
