output .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and put together the fifteen features and the three mlp output .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , , the result are li little bit better , but more or less similar .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'m 'm slightly confused .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what what feeds the the three - output net ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "voice , unvoice , and si", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no no , what feeds it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what features does it see ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the feature the input ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the inputs are the fifteen the fifteen bases feature .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the with the new code .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the other three features are , the variance of the difference between the two spectrum ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the variance of the auto - correlation function , except the first point , because half the height value is - zero", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and also - zero ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the first coefficient of the auto - correlation function .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that is like the energy with these three feature ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "also these three feature .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you wouldn't do like - one over - zero like that ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "usually for voiced - unvoiced you 'd do , you 'd do something you 'd do energy", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then you have something like spectral slope , which is you get like - one ov over - zero like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what are the 's ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "'m missed it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "auto - correlation ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , yes , the variance of the auto - correlation function that uses that", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ye - that 's the variance ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if you just say \" what is \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to first order ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one of the differences between voiced , unvoiced and silence is energy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "another one is but the other one is the spectral shape .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the spectral shape ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so - one over - zero is what you typically use for that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'m saying that 's what people us typically use .",

"so if it 's if it 's if it 's low energy but the but the spectrum looks like that or like that , it 's probably silence .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if it 's low energy and the spectrum looks like that , it 's probably unvoiced .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if you just if you just had to pick two features to determine voiced - unvoiced , you 'd pick something about the spectrum like - one over - zero , and - zero", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or you 'd have some other energy measure", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like in the old days people did like zero crossing counts .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also use this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "bec - because the result are little bit better", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we have in point that everything is more or less the similar more or less similar .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's not quite better .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it seemed to me that what you were getting at before was that there is something about the difference between the original signal or the original fft and with the filter which is what", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the variance was one take on it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "used this too .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it could be something else .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "suppose you didn't have anything like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then in that case , if you have two nets ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "alright , and this one has three outputs , and this one has", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "fifty - six , ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you were to sum up the probabilities for the voiced and for the unvoiced and for the silence here , we 've found in the past you 'll do better at voiced - unvoiced - silence than you do with this one .",

you 're saying take the features that go into the voiced - unvoiced - silence net and feed those into the other one , as additional inputs , rather than having separate", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's another way .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that wasn't what was saying", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that 's certainly another thing to do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no was just trying to say if you if you bring this into the picture over this , what more does it buy you ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and what was saying is that the only thing that it buys you is based on whether you feed it something different .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and something different in some fundamental way .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so the thing that she was talking about before , was looking at something ab something about the difference between the log fft log power and the log magnitude - spectrum and the filter bank .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so the filter bank is chosen to integrate out the effects of pitch", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and she 's saying", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the particular measure that she chose was the variance of this of this difference ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that might not be the number .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 's something about the variance that 's that 's not enough", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or there 's something else that one could use ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that , for me , the thing that struck me was that you wanna get something back here ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so here 's here 's an idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what about it you skip all the all the really clever things , and just fed the log magnitude spectrum into this ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have the log magnitude spectrum , and you were looking at that and the difference between the filter bank and computing the variance .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's clever thing to do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what if you stopped being clever ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you just took this thing in here because it 's neural net and neural nets are wonderful", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and figure out what they can what they most need from things , and that 's what they 're good at .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you 're you 're trying to be clever and say what 's the statistic that should we should get about this difference", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , just feeding this in or feeding both of them in", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "another way , saying let it figure out what 's the what is the interaction ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "especially if you do this over multiple frames ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then you have this over time , and both kinds of measures", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you might get something better .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so so don't don't do the division ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but let the net have everything .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's another thing you could do", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it seems to me , if you have exactly the thing then it 's better to do it without the net", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because otherwise you 're asking the net to learn this", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "say if you wanted to learn how to do multiplication .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you could feed it bunch of you could feed two numbers that you wanted to multiply into net", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and have bunch of nonlinearities in the middle", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and train it to get the product of the output and it would work .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , it 's crazy ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "cuz we know how to multiply", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you 'd be much lower error usually if you just multiplied it out .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but suppose you don't really the thing is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that 's what these dumb

same .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "at the frame level for fifty - six that was the number we were getting for reduced band width .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that that for the other one , for the three output , is sixty - two , sixty three more or less .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's all ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's pretty bad .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because it 's noise

time to begin to study", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the france telecom proposal", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to look at the code", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and something like that", "speaker": "D"},

the number inside the log and raising it to sixteen over log base two .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "sixteen over two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "does it have to do with those sixty - fours ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if we ignore the sixteen , the natural log of one over the natural log of two times the natu", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "somebody 'll think of something ,", "speaker":

effect of this ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because it 's to do something like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it says , since you 're taking natural log , it says that when you get down to essentially zero energy , this is gonna be the natural log of one , which is zero .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it 'll go down to to {nonvocalsound} the natural log being", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the lowest value for this would be zero .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you 're restricted to being positive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and this smooths it for very small energies .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "why they chose sixty - four and something else , that was probably just experimental .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the the constant in front of it , have no idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "will look to try if move this parameter in their code what happens ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "everything is they tres hole are on basis of this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it they probably have some fi particular fixed point arithmetic that they 're using ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then it just", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was just gonna say it has something to do with hardware ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "something they were doing .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that they 're probably working with fixed point or integer .", "speaker": "C"},

"speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wanna talk little bit about what we were talking about this morning ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just briefly , or or anything else ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so . some of the progress , 've been getting getting my committee members for the quals .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so far have morgan and hynek , mike jordan ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and asked john ohala and he .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so 'm need to ask malek .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then talked little bit about continuing with these dynamic ev acoustic events ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we 're we 're thinking about way to test the completeness of set of dynamic events .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "completeness in the in the sense that if we if we pick these number of acoustic events , do they provide sufficient coverage for the phones that we 're trying to recognize or the the words that we 're gonna try to recognize later on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so morgan and were discussing form of cheating experiment where we get we have chosen set of features , or acoustic events ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we train up hybrid system to do phone recognition on timit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the idea is if we get good phone recognition results , using these set of acoustic events , then that says that these acoustic events are sufficient to cover set of phones ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "at least found in timit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it would be measure of \" are we on the track with the choices of our acoustic events \" .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that 's going on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and also , just working on my final project for jordan 's class ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually , let me", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "hold that thought .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let me back up while we 're still on it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the the other thing was suggesting , though , is that given that you 're talking about binary features , , the first thing to do is just to count", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and count co - occurrences and get probabilities for discrete", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "cuz that 'd be pretty simple", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because it 's just say , if you had ten events , that you were counting , each frame would only have thousand possible values for these ten bits ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so you could make table that would say , if you had thirty - nine phone categories , that would be thousand by thirty - nine ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and just count the co - occurrences and divide them by the occ count the co - occurrences between the event and the phone and divide them by the number of occurrences of the phone ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that would give you the likelihood of the of the event given the phone .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then just use that in very simple", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you could do phone recognition then and wouldn't have any of the issues of the training of the net or", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 'd be on the simple side ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if the example was giving was that if you had onset of voicing and end of voicing as being two kinds of events , then if you had those all marked correctly , and you counted co - occurrences , you should get it completely .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you 'd get all the other distinctions , , randomly wrong .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 'd be nothing to tell you that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you just do this by counting , then you should be able to find out in pretty straightforward way whether you have sufficient set of events to do the level of classification of phones that you 'd like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that was that was the idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then the other thing that we were discussing was , how do you get the your training data .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "cuz the switchboard transcription project was half dozen people , or so working off and on over couple years ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "similar amount of data to what you 're talking about with timit training .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , it seems to me that the only reasonable starting point is to automatically translate the current timit markings into the markings you want .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it won't have the characteristic that you 'd like , of catching funny things that aren't there from these automatic markings ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's probably good place to start .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and short amount of time ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just to again , just to see if that information is sufficient to determine the phones .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you could even then to get an idea about how different it is , you could take some subset and , go through few sentences , mark them by hand", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then see how different it is from , the canonical ones ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "just to get an idea rough idea of if it really even makes difference .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you can get little feeling for it that way ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that is probably .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "my would be that this is since timit 's read speech that this would be less of big deal ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you went and looked at spontaneous speech it 'd be more of one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the other thing would be , say , if you had these ten events , you 'd wanna see , what if you took two events or four events or ten events or", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and hopefully there should be some point at which having more information doesn't tell you really all that much more about what the phones are .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you could define other events as being sequences of these events too .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but , what he 's talking about here is translation to per - frame feature vector ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so there 's no sequence in that ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "unless you did like second pass over it after you 've got your", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but we 're just talking about something simple here , , to see if", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'m adding complexity .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the idea is with with very simple statistical structure , could you could you at least verify that you 've chosen features that are sufficient .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you were saying something starting to say something else about your class project , or ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so for my class project 'm 'm tinkering with support vector machines ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "something that we learned in class ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and just another method for doing classification .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so 'm gonna apply that to compare it with the results by king and taylor who did these", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "using recurrent neural nets , they recognized set of phonological features", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and made mapping from the mfcc 's to these phonological features ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so 'm gonna do similar thing with support vector machines", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what 's the advantage of support vector machines ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , support vector machines are good with dealing with less amount of data", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so if you if you give it less data it still does reasonable job in learning the patterns .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they 're succinct ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "does there some distance metric that they use", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "or how do they for cla what do they do for classification ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , the simple idea behind support vector machine is , you have you have this feature space ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then it finds the optimal separating plane , between these two different classes ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and and so ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what it at the end of the day , what it actually does is it picks those examples of the features that are closest to the separating boundary ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and uses them to recreate the boundary for the test set .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , given these these features , or these examples , , critical examples , which they call support support vectors , then given new example , if the new example falls away from the boundary in one direction then it 's classified as being part of this particular class", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and otherwise it 's the other class .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so why save the examples ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "why not just save what the boundary itself is ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "let 's see .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's good question .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's another way of doing it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "? so so it it 's", "speaker":

one thing that 's little bit", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "was looking 've been studying and going through the logs for the system that andreas created .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and his the way that the system looks like it works is that it reads the wavefiles directly ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and does all of the cepstral computation on the fly .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and , so there 's no place where these where the cepstral files are stored , anywhere that go look at and compare to the plp ones ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so whereas with our features , he 's actually

"you just for continuity you just approximate them by the second to highest and second to lowest .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's just simple thing we put in .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and and

hundred hertz or so", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it 's just not going to affect phonetic classification .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "another thing was thinking about was is there", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "was wondering if there 's certain settings of the parameters when you compute plp which would it to output mel cepstrum .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so that , in effect , what could do is use our code", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but produce mel cepstrum", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and compare that directly to", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's not precisely .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what you can do is you can definitely change the filter bank from being trapezoidal integration to triangular one ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which is what the typical mel cepstral filter bank does .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and some people have claimed that they got some better performance doing that ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you certainly could do that easily .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the fundamental difference ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 's other small differences", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 's cubic root that happens ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but , , as opposed to the log in the other case .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the fundamental difference that we 've seen any difference from before , which is actually an advantage for the , , is that the smoothing at the end is auto - regressive instead of being cepstral , from cepstral truncation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it 's little more noise robust .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that 's that 's why when people started getting databases that had little more noise in it , like broadcast news and so on ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's why cambridge switched to plp .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's difference that don't think we put any way to get around ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "since it was an advantage .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we did we did hear this comment from people at some point , that it they got some better results with the triangular filters rather than the trapezoidal .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that is an option in rasta .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you can certainly play with that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you 're probably doing the thing to look for bugs first .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just it just seems like this behavior could be caused by some of the training data being messed up .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you 're getting most of the way there , but there 's", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so started going through and looking", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "one of the things that did notice was that the log likelihoods coming out of the log recognizer from the plp data were much lower , much smaller ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "than for the mel cepstral , and that the average amount of pruning that was happening was therefore little bit higher for the plp features .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , since he used the same exact pruning thresholds for both , was wondering if it could be that we 're getting more pruning .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "he he he used the identical pruning thresholds even though the the range of of the likeli", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's that 's pretty good point there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would think that you might wanna do something like , look at few points to see where you are starting to get significant search errors .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what was gonna do is was gonna take couple of the utterances that he had run through ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "then run them through again", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but modify the pruning threshold and see if it , affects the score .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but you could if if that looks promising you could , , run the overall test set with with few different pruning thresholds for both ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and presumably he 's running at some pruning threshold that 's that 's , gets very few search errors", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but is relatively fast", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", , generally in these things you turn back pruning really far ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so didn't would be that big deal", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because was figuring you have it turned back so far that it", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but you may be in the wrong range for the features for some reason .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the the run time of the recognizer on the plp features is longer", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "which implies that the networks are bushier ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "there 's more things it 's considering", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "which goes along with the fact that the matches aren't as good .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , , it could be that we 're just pruning too much .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "just be different distributions", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that 's another possible thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they they should really shouldn't", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 's no particular reason why they would be exactly behave exactly the same .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 's lots of little differences .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "trying to track it down .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "this was little bit off topic , ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because was was thinking in terms of this as being core item that once we once we had it going we would use for number of the front - end things also .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's as far as my goes ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what 's what 's on", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "tried this mean subtraction method .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "due to avendano , 'm taking six seconds of speech ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'m using two second fft analysis frames , stepped by half second", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it 's quarter length step",

{"text": "'m 'm guessing it was the training data .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "clean ti - digits is , like , pretty pristine training data ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if they trained the sri

"C"}, {"text": "or it wa it was around one .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it was getting around one percent for the near for the for the close mike .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it was like one to five", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it 's still this ratio .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's lot more training data .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so probably it should be something we should try

ta", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you 're so you have system which for one reason or another is relatively poor ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you have something like forty - one percent error",
