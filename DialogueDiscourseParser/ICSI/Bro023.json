around for three weeks .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "he 's , , , very , easygoing ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "easy to talk to ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , , very interested in everything .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we met him in amsterdam .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "he 's been here before .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "he 's he 's he 's", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wh - back when was grad student he was here for , year or six months .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "haven't noticed him .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "something like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "something like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "he 's he 's done couple stays here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , , we got lots to catch up on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we haven't met for couple of weeks .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we didn't meet last week , morgan .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "went around and talked to everybody ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it seemed like they had some new results", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but rather than them coming up and telling me figured we should just week and they can tell both , all of us .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "why don't we why don't we start with you , dave ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then , , we can go on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , , since we 're looking at putting this , mean log magnitude spectral subtraction , , into the smartkom system , did test seeing if , , it would work using past only and plus the present to calculate the mean .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , did test , , where used twelve seconds from the past and the present frame to , , calculate the mean .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "twelve twelve seconds back from the current frame ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that what you mean ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "twelve seconds , , counting back from the end of the current frame ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so it was , , twen it was twenty - one frames", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and that worked out to about twelve seconds .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and compared to , , do using twelve second centered window , there was drop in performance", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but it was just slight drop .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "is is that ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": ", it was pretty it was pretty tiny .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that was encouraging .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that , that 's encouraging for the idea of using it in an interactive system like", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and , , another issue 'm 'm thinking about is in the smartkom system .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so say twe twelve seconds in the earlier test seemed like good length of time ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but what happens if you have less than twelve seconds ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so bef before , back in may , did some experiments using , say , two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "in those trained the models using mean subtraction with the means calculated over two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "here , was curious , what if trained the models using twelve seconds", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but gave it situation where the test set was subtracted using two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so did that for about three different conditions .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it was , , four se", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it was , , something like four seconds and , , six seconds , and eight seconds .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "something like that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and it seems like it it hurts compared to if you actually train the models using that same length of time", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but it doesn't hurt that much .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "usually less than point five percent ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "although did see one where it was point eight percent or so rise in word error rate .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but this is , , where , , even if train on the , , model , and mean subtracted it with the same length of time as in the test , it the word error rate is around , , ten percent or nine percent .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so it doesn't seem like that big difference .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but it but looking at it the other way , isn't it what you 're saying that it didn't help you to have the longer time for training ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you were going to have short time for", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that that 's true .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "why would you do it , if you knew that you were going to have short windows in testing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it seems like for your , in normal situations you would never get twelve seconds of speech ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you need twelve seconds in the past to estimate , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or or you 're looking at six sec seconds in future and six in", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , total .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for the test it 's just twelve seconds in the past .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "no , it 's all", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is this twelve seconds of , regardless of speech or silence ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or twelve seconds of speech ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "of of speech .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the other thing , , which relates little bit to something else we 've talked about in terms of windowing and so on is , that , , wonder if you trained with twelve seconds , and then when you were two seconds in you used two seconds ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and when you were four seconds in , you used four seconds ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and when you were six", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you build up to the twelve seconds .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that if you have very long utterances you have the best ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if you have shorter utterances you use what you can .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that 's actually what we 're planning to do in", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so so the que the question was trying to get at with those experiments is , \" does it matter what models you use ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "does it matter how much time you use to calculate the mean when you were , , tra doing the training data ? \"", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but the other thing is that 's", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the other way of looking at this , going back to , , mean cepstral subtraction versus rasta things , is that you could look at mean cepstral subtraction ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "especially the way you 're doing it , , as being filter .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so , the other thing is just to design filter .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you 're you 're doing high - pass filter or band - pass filter of some sort", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and just design filter .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then , , filter will have certain behavior", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you loo can look at the start up behavior when you start up with nothing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and and , , it will , , if you have an iir filter , it will , , , not behave in the steady - state way that you would like it to behave until you get long enough period ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "by just constraining yourself to have your filter be only subtraction of the mean , you 're , , tying your hands behind your back", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because there 's filters have all sorts of be temporal and spectral behaviors .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the only thing , , consistent that we know about is that you want to get rid of the very low frequency component .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but do you really want to calculate the mean ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you neglect all the silence regions or you just use everything that 's twelve seconds ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you do you mean in my tests so far ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "most of the silence has been cut out .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "just there 's just inter - word silences .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and they are , like , pretty short .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you really need lot of speech to estimate the mean of it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if only use six seconds , it still works pretty .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "saw in my test before .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "was trying twelve seconds cuz that was the best in my test before", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and that increasing past twelve seconds didn't seem to help .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's something need to play with more to decide how to set that up for the smartkom system .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "like , may if trained on six seconds it would work better when only had two seconds or four seconds , and", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": ", if you take this filtering perspective and if you essentially have it build up over time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you computed means over two and then over four , and over six , essentially what you 're getting at is , , ramp up of filter anyway .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so you may just want to think of it as filter .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , , if you do that , then , , in practice somebody using the smartkom system , one would they 're using it for while , it means that their first utterance , instead of , , getting , , forty percent error rate reduction , they 'll get , over what , , you 'd get without this , , , policy , , you get thirty percent .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then the second utterance that you give , they get the full , , full benefit of it if it 's this ongoing thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you cache the utterances ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's how you get your ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'m saying in practice , ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's if somebody 's using system to ask for directions ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they 'll say something first .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and and to begin with if it doesn't get them quite , ma they 'll come back and say , \" excuse me ? \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it should have some policy like that anyway .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and and , ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in any event they might ask second question .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it 's not like what he 's doing doesn't , , improve things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it does improve things ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just not as much as he would like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so , , there 's higher probability of it making an error , , in the first utterance .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what would be really is if you could have", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this probably users would never like this", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if you had could have system where , before they began to use it they had to introduce themselves , verbally .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my name is so - and - so ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'m from blah - blah . \"", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you could use that initial speech to do all these adaptations", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the other thing which ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "much about as much as should about the rest of the system", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "couldn't you , , if you if you did first pass", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what , , capability we have at the moment for doing second passes on , , some little small lattice , or graph , or confusion network , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if you did first pass with , , the with either without the mean sub subtraction or with very short time one ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then , , once you , , actually had the whole utterance in , if you did , , the , , longer time version then , based on everything that you had , , and then at that point only used it to distinguish between , , top , , possible utterances , you might it might not take very much time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the large vocabulary stu , systems , people were evaluating on in the past , some people really pushed everything in to make it in one pass", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but other people didn't and had multiple passes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the argument , , against multiple passes was has often been \" but we want to this to be have interactive response \" .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the counterargument to that which , say , , bbn had , was \" ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but our second responses are second , , passes and third passes are really , really fast \" .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , , if your second pass takes millisecond who cares ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the idea of the second pass would be waiting till you have more recorded speech ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so if it turned out to be problem , that you didn't have enough speech because you need longer window to do this processing , then , , one tactic is , looking at the larger system and not just at the front - end is to take in , , the speech with some simpler mechanism or shorter time mechanism ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do the best you can , and come up with some al possible alternates of what might have been said .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , , either in the form of an - best list or in the form of lattice , or confusion network , or whatever .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then the decoding of that is much , much faster or can be much , much faster if it isn't big bushy network .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you can decode that now with speech that you 've actually processed using this longer time , , subtraction .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , it 's it 's common that people do this thing where they do more things that are more complex or require looking over more time , whatever , in some second pass .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", if the second pass is really , really fast , another one 've heard of is in connected digit , , going back and and through backtrace and finding regions that are considered to be digit , but , , which have very low energy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , , there 's lots of things you can do in second passes , sorts of levels .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "anyway , 'm throwing too many things out .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so is that , that it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "do you wanna go , sunil ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the last two weeks was , like", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so 've been working on that wiener filtering .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "found that , , single like , do normal wiener filtering , like the standard method of wiener filtering .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that doesn't actually give me any improvement over like", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", it actually improves over the baseline", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it 's not like it doesn't meet something like fifty percent .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , 've been playing with the", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "improves over the base line mfcc system ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that 's the improvement is somewhere around , like , thirty percent over

"speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it actually improves over the baseline of not having wiener filter in the whole system .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like have an lda lda plus on - line normalization ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then plug in the wiener filter in that ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it improves over not having the wiener filter .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it doesn't take it like be beyond like thirty percent over the baseline .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that 's what 'm confused about ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "cuz that our system was more like forty percent without the wiener filtering .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's like , ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is this with the new vad ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , it 's the old vad .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so my baseline was , , nine", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is like the baseline is ninety - five point six eight , and eighty - nine , and", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , if you can do all these in word errors it 's lot lot easier actually .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what was that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you do all these in word error rates it 's lot easier , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "errors , , don't have .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "cuz then you can figure out the percentages .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's all accuracies .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the baseline is something similar to", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the the baseline that you are talking about is the mfcc baseline , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there are two baselines .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the baseline one baseline is mfcc baseline", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that when said thirty percent improvement it 's like mfcc baseline .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what 's it start on ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the mfcc baseline is what ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is at what level ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's just the mel frequency and that 's it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , what 's what 's the number ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so don't have that number here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have it here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's the vad plus the baseline actually .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'m talking about the mfcc plus do frame dropping on it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that 's like the word

good to estimate the noise", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because it cuts into the speech sometimes ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so end up overestimating the noise and getting worse result .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it works only for italian by for using vad to estimate noise .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it works for italian because the vad was trained on italian .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this was ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so this was giving", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this was like not improving lot on this baseline of not having the wiener filter on it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ran this with one more stage of wiener filtering on it", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the second time , what did was estimated the new wiener filter based on the cleaned up speech , and did , , smoothing in the frequency to reduce the variance", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have 've observed there are , like , lot of bumps in the frequency when do this wiener filtering", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is more like musical noise .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so by adding another stage of wiener filtering , the results on the speechdat - car was like ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , still don't have the word error rate .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'m about it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the overall improvement was like fifty - six point four six .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this was again using ten frames of noise estimate and two stage of wiener filtering .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the rest is like the lda plu and the on - line normalization all remaining the same .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this was , like , compared to , fifty - seven is what you got by using the french telecom system ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , don't .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is it on italian ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is over the whole speechdat - car .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", fifty - seven", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the new the new wiener filtering schema is like some fifty - six point four six", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is like one percent still less than what you got using the french telecom system .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it 's pretty similar number in any event .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's very similar .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but again , you 're you 're more or less doing what they were doing ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's it 's different in sense like", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'m actually cleaning up the cleaned up spectrum", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which they 're not doing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they 're what they 're doing is , they have two stage stages of estimating the wiener filter ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the final filter , what they do is they take it to their time domain by doing an inverse fourier transform .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and they filter the original signal using that fil filter ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is like final filter is acting on the input noisy speech rather than on the cleaned up .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is more like 'm doing wiener filter twice ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the only thing is that the second time 'm actually smoothing the filter and then cleaning up the cleaned up spectrum first level .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so that 's that 's what the difference is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and actually tried it on the original clean , the original spectrum where , like , the second time estimate the filter but actually clean up the noisy speech rather the first output of the first stage", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that doesn't seems to be giving , , that much improvement .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "didn't run it for the whole case .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and what what tried was , by using the same thing", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we actually found that the vad is very , like , crucial .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just by changing the vad itself gives you the lot of improvement", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "by instead of using the current vad , if you just take up the vad output from the channel zero , when instead of using channel zero and channel one ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because that was the that was the reason why was not getting lot of improvement

{"text": "what 's channel zero vad ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'m 'm confused about that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , it 's like", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it 's the close - talking microphone .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the close - talking without", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so because the channel zero and channel one are like the same speech , but only , the same endpoints .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the only thing is that the speech is very noisy for channel one ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can actually use the output of the channel zero for channel one for the vad .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's like cheating method .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so are they going to pro", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what are they doing to do ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do we know yet ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "about as far as what they 're what the rules are going to be and what we can use ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so actually received new

close - talking microphone ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which is the channel zero .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and to take the result of the recognition to get the boundaries , of speech .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it 's not like that 's being done in one place or one time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's that 's just rule", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we 'd you were

they will send files", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so everybody will have the same boundaries to work with ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but actually their alignment actually is not seems to be improving in like on all cases .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what happened here is that , , the overall improvement that they have with this method", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , to be more

hundred milliseconds before speech and two hundred after speech .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and they keep the speech pauses also .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the overall improvement over the

{"text": "it gives like negative , in like some italian and ti - digits ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "some @ @ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so by using the endpointed speech , actually it 's worse than the baseline in some instances ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which could be due to the word pattern .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , the other thing also is that fourteen percent is less than what you obtain using real vad .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so with without cheating like this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this shows that there is still work", "speaker": "D"}, {"text":

have two channels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like let 's say you have clean signal and you have an additional channel where what is the noisy signal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then you try to minimize the error between these two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that 's the basic principle .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can do that", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you have only noisy

these eq", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then you do this", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is the transfer function of the wiener filter ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so \" sf \" is clean speech spectrum , power spectrum", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and \" \" is the noisy power spectrum .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so this is the transfer function .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then you multiply your noisy power spectrum with this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you get an estimate of the clean power spectrum .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that you have to estimate the sf from the noisy spectrum , what you have .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you estimate the nf from the initial noise portions", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then you subtract that from the current noisy spectrum to get an estimate of the sf .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so sometimes that becomes zero", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because you do you don't have true estimate of the noise .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the filter will have like sometimes zeros in it", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because some frequency values will be zeroed out because of that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that

whole class of techniques where you try in some sense to minimize the noise .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it 's typically mean square sense , , in in some way .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and ,

better .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so why did you choose , , wiener filtering over some other one of these other techniques ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the reason was , like , we had this choice of using spectral subtraction , wiener filtering , and there was one more thing which 'm trying , is this sub space approach .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "stephane is working on spectral subtraction .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you 're trying @ @ them all .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we just wanted to have few noise production compensation

"speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that doesn't seems to be improving by trying it on the first time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what did was like did this", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then you plugged in the one more the same thing but with the smoothed filter the second time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that seems to be working .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that 's where got like fifty - six point five percent improvement on speechdat - car with that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the other thing what tried was used still the ten frames of noise estimate", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but used this channel zero vad to drop the frames .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so 'm not still not estimating .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that has taken the performance to like sixty - seven percent in speechdat - car ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is which like shows that by using proper vad you can just take it to further , better levels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that 's like , , best - case performance ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so far 've seen sixty - seven", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "haven't seen like sixty - seven percent .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "using the channel zero vad to estimate the noise also seems to be improving", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but don't have the results for all the cases with that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so used channel zero vad to estimate noise as lesser 2 frame ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is like , everywhere use the channel zero vad .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that seems to be the

information going to be accessible during this test .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is just to test whether we can really improve by using better vad .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is like the noise compensation is fixed", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you make better decision on the endpoints .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's , like seems to be", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , which means , like , by using this technique what we improve just the vad", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can just take the performance by another ten percent or better .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , that was just the , , reason for doing that experiment .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but this all these things , have to still try it on the ti - digits ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is

"speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the other the other thing is like 've been 'm doing all this on the power spectrum .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "tried this on the mel as", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "mel and the magnitude , and mel magnitude , and all those things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it seems to be the power spectrum seems to be getting the best result .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text":

about the subspace ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "subspace , 'm 'm like that 's still in little bit in the back burner", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because 've been putting lot effort on this to make

{"text": "so , 've been , , working still on the spectral subtraction .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so to to remind you little bit of what did before , is just to apply some spectral subtraction with an overestimation factor", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "also to get , , an estimate of the noise , , spectrum ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and subtract this estimation of the noise spectrum from the ,

?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you overestimate the noise spectrum .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you multiply the noise spectrum by factor , , which depends on the snr .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , above twenty db ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's one , so you just subtract the noise .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then it 's", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "generally , use , actually , linear , , function of the snr ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which is bounded to , like , two or three , when the snr is below zero db .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "doing just this , ,

threshold , ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because after subtraction you can have negative energies ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what do is to put , to add to put the threshold first and then to add small amount of noise ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which now is speech - shaped .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "speech - shaped ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it 's it has the overall energy ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it has the overall power spectrum of speech .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so with bump around one kilohertz .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so when when you talk about there being something less than zero after subtracting the noise , is that at particular frequency bin ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there can be frequency bins with negative values .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so when you say you 're adding something that has the overall shape of speech , is that in in particular frequency bin ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or you 're adding something across all the frequencies when you get these negatives ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for each frequencies 'm adding some , , noise ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the the amount of the amount of noise add is not the same for all the frequency bins .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now don't it makes sense to add something that 's speech - shaped ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because then you have silence portion that have some spectra similar to the sp the overall speech spectra .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this is something still work on ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what does that mean ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'m trying to understand what it means when you do the spectral subtraction and you get negative .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it means that at that particular frequency range you subtracted more energy than there was actually", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so so , you have an estimation of the noise spectrum ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but sometimes , , it 's as the noise is not perfectly stationary ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "sometimes this estimation can be , , too small ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you don't subtract enough .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but sometimes it can be too large also . if if the noise , , energy in this particular frequency band drops for some reason .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so in an ideal word world if the noise were always the same , then , when you subtracted it the worst that you would get would be zero .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the lowest you would get would be zero ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "cuz if there was no other energy there you 're just subtracting exactly the noise .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there 's all there 's all sorts of , , deviations from the ideal here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", you 're you 're talking about the signal and noise , , at particular point .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and even if something is stationary in ster terms of statistics ,

chunk of of the signal what you think the noise is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then you 're subtracting that from another chunk ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and there 's no reason to think that you 'd know that it wouldn't , , be negative in some places .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on the other hand that just means that in some sense you 've made mistake", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because you certainly have stra subtracted bigger number than is due to the noise .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also , we speak the whole where all this comes from is from an assumption that signal and noise are uncorrelated .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that certainly makes sense in in statistical interpretation , that , , over , , all possible realizations that they 're uncorrelated", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or assuming , , ergodicity that , across time , , it 's uncorrelated .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if you just look at quarter second , , and you cross - multiply the two things , , you could very , , end up with something that sums to something that 's not zero .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , the two signals could have some relation to one another .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so there 's all sorts of deviations from ideal in this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and and given all that , you could definitely end up with something that 's negative .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if down the road you 're making use of something as if it is power spectrum , , then it can be bad to have something negative .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now , the other thing wonder about actually is , what if you left it negative ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is that the log ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "are you taking the log before you add them up to the mel ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , wonder how if you put your thresholds after that , wonder how often you would end up with , with negative values .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you end up reducing some neighboring frequency bins @ @ in the average , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "when you add the negative to the positive value", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is the true

your best shot at figuring out what the noise should be ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and now then you 've subtracted it off .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then after that , instead of instead of , , leaving it as is and adding things adding up some neighbors , you artificially push it up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which is , , it 's there 's no particular reason that 's the thing to do either ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what you 'd be doing is saying , \" , we 're we 're we 're going to definitely diminish the effect of this frequency in this little frequency bin in the in the overall mel summation \" .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's just thought .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it would be", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the opposite of that would be if you find out you 're going to get negative number , you don't do the subtraction for that bin .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that is true .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would be almost the opposite ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "instead of leaving it negative , you don't do it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if your if your subtraction 's going to result in negative number , you don't do subtraction in that .",

opposite .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's that 's the opposite ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "some people also if it 's negative value they , , re - compute it using inter interpolation from the

"C"}, {"text": "actually tried , something else based on this , , is to put some smoothing ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because it seems to help or it seems to help the wiener filtering", "speaker":

"D"}, {"text": "actually , when you do spectral subtraction you can , , find this equivalent in the in the spectral domain .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can compute ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can say that your spectral subtraction is filter ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the gain of this filter is the , , signal energy minus what you subtract , divided by the signal energy .",

below zero one frame and then you can have an energy that 's above zero .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the smoothing is did smoothing actually on this gain , , trajectory .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it 's the smoothing is nonlinear in the sense that tried to not smooth if the gain is high ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because in this case we know that , , the estimate of the gain is correct", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because we are not close to to zero ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and to do more smoothing if the gain is low .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's this idea

.", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "another thing that it 's important to mention is , , that this has this has some additional latency .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because when do the smoothing , , it

first twenty frames of each utterance .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't remember for this experiment what did you use for these two stage", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "used ten just ten frames .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the ten frames ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the reason was like in ti - digits don't have lot .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "had twenty frames most of the time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , so what 's this result you told me about , the fact that if you use more than ten frames you can improve by", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's that 's using the channel zero .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if use channel zero vad to estimate the noise .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but this is ten frames plus", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "channel zero dropping .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "these results with two stage wiener filtering is ten frames", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but possibly more .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if channel one vad gives you", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but in this experiment did didn't use any vad .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "used the twenty first frame to estimate the noise .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so expected it to be little bit better , if , , use more frames .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's it for spectral subtraction .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the second thing was working on is to , , try to look at noise estimation , mmm , and using some technique that doesn't need voice activity detection .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and for this simply used some code that , , had from belgium ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which is technique that , , takes bunch of frame ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and for each frequency bands of this frame , takes look at the minima of the energy .",

to this actually .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what is done is that , , these minima are computed , , based on , , high resolution spectra .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , compute an fft based on the long , , signal frame", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which is sixty - four millisecond", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you have one minimum for each frequency ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what what , do actually , is to take bunch of to take tile on the spectrogram", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and this tile is five hundred milliseconds long and two hundred hertz wide .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in this tile appears , like , the harmonics if you have voiced sound ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because it 's it 's the ftt bins .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and when you take the the minima of these this tile ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "when you don't have speech , these minima will give you some noise level estimate ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you have voiced speech , these minima will still give you some noise estimate because the minima are between the harmonics .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if you have other speech sounds then it 's not the case ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but if the time frame is long enough , , like five hundred milliseconds seems to be long enough , you still have portions which , , are very close whi which minima are very close to the noise energy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you said five hundred milliseconds", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you said sixty - four milliseconds .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which is which ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "sixty - four milliseconds is to compute the fft , , bins .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the the fft .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "actually it 's better to use sixty - four milliseconds because , , if you use thirty milliseconds , then , , because of the this short windowing and at low pitch , , sounds , the harmonics are not , wha , correctly separated .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if you take these minima , it they will overestimate the noise lot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you take sixty - four millisecond ts and then you average them over five hundred ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what do you do over five hundred ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so take to take bunch of these sixty - four millisecond frame to cover five hundred milliseconds ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then look for the minima ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "on the on the bunch of fifty frames , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the interest of this is that , as with this technique you can estimate some reasonable noise spectra with only five hundred milliseconds of signal ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if the the noise varies lot , , you can track better track the noise ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which is not the case if you rely on the voice activity detector .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so even if there are no speech pauses , you can track the noise level .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the only requirement is that you must have , in these five hundred milliseconds segment , you must have voiced sound at least .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "cuz this these will help you to track the noise level .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what did is just to simply replace the vad - based , , noise estimate by this estimate ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "first on speechdat - car", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "only on speechdat - car actually .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it 's , , slightly worse ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like one percent relative compared to the vad - based estimates .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the reason why it 's not better , is that the speechdat - car noises are all stationary .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there really is no need to have something that 's adaptive", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they are mainly stationary .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , expect some improvement on ti - digits", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because , nnn , in this case the noises are all sometimes very variable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so have to test it .", "speaker": "D"},

"vad - is this is this the ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's the france - telecom - based spectra , , wiener filtering and vad .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it 's their system", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but just replace their noise estimate by this one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you 're not doing this with our system ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "D"},

system but with their noise compensation scheme ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so 'm trying to improve on this , and by replacing their noise estimate by , , something that might be better .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the spectral subtraction scheme that you reported on also re requires noise estimate .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "couldn't you try this for that ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you might help ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because did this in parallel ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and was working on one and the other .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "try also , mmm , the spectral subtraction .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so 'm also using that new noise estimate technique on this wiener filtering what 'm trying .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so have , like , some experiments running , don't have the results .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't estimate the noise on the ten frames but use his estimate .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", also implemented sp spectral whitening idea", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which is in the , , ericsson proposal .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the idea is just to , flatten the log , , spectrum , , and to flatten it more if the probability of silence is higher .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so in this way , you can also reduce somewhat reduce the musical noise", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and you reduce the variability if you have different noise shapes ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because the spectrum becomes more flat in the silence portions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "with this , no improvement ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but there are lot of parameters that we can play with", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "actually , this could be seen as soft version of the frame dropping", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because , , you could just put the threshold and say that \" below the threshold , will flatten comp completely flatten the spectrum \" .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and above this threshold , , keep the same spectrum .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it would be like frame dropping ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because during the silence portions which are below the threshold of voice activity probability , , you would have some dummy frame", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which is perfectly flat spectrum .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and this , , whitening is something that 's more soft because , , you whiten you just , , have function the whitening is function of the speech probability ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it 's not hard decision .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it can be used together with frame dropping and when we are not about if it 's speech or silence ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it has something do with this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's interesting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", , in jrasta we were essentially adding in , , white , white noise dependent on our estimate of the noise .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on the overall estimate of the noise .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it never occurred to us to use probability in there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you could imagine one that that made use of where the amount that you added in was , , function of the probability of it being speech or noise .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now it 's constant that just depending on the noise spectrum .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "cuz that brings in powers of classifiers that we don't really have in , , this other estimate .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it could be it could be interesting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what what point does the , , system stop recording ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 'll keep going till when they run out of disk space ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it went little long ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so there are with this technique there are some", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "did something exactly the same as the ericsson proposal", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , , the probability of speech is not computed the same way .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , for , for lot of things , actually good speech probability is important .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like for frame dropping you improve , like you can improve from ten percent as sunil showed , if you use the channel zero speech probabilities .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for this it might help ,",
