like to have discussion about where we are on , recording , transcription", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "where we are on the corpus .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then , the other thing which would like to talk about which is real meta - quest , , deal is , , agendas .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so 'll 'll start with that actually .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": ". andreas brought up the fact that he would kinda like to know , if possible , what we were gonna be talking about", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because he 's peripherally involved to this point ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and if there 's gonna be topic about discussion about something that he strongly cares about then he would come", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and and part of part of his motivation with this is that he 's

"and so , he figures he could help that out by not showing", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and 'm help out his own time .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "by not showing up if it 's meeting that he 's he 's", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , in order", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "'d that this is wish on his part .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's actually gonna be hard", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because it seems like lot of times things come up that are unanticipated", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but , we could try anyway ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "do another try at coming up with the agenda , at some point before the meeting ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "say the day before .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it would be good idea for one of us to like on wednesday , or tuesday send

"speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'m wondering if he were to just , , specify particular topics ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we 'd be able to meet that request of his little more .", "speaker": "F"},

topic which is", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so we 're done with that topic .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the other topic was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "actually was going to say we need to talk about that too .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "why why don't we do that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the new microphones , the two new ones are in .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they are being assembled as we speak , hope .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and didn't bring my car today so 'm gonna pick them up tomorrow .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then the other question was thinking about is , couple things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "first of all , if the other headsets are lot more comfortable , we should probably just go ahead and get them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we 'll have to evaluate that when they come in ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and get people 's opinions on what they think of them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then the other question had is we should get another wireless .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "another wireless setup .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's expensive , but it does seem to be better than the wired .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so how many channels do you get to have in wireless setup ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": ", 'm pretty that you can daisy - chain them together", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we currently have one base station with six wireless mike ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "possibility of six wireless receivers ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you can chain those together .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , it 's still , it 's fifteen minus six .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so let 's see we", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so we could have up to nine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and now we can have up to six .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and we have five , we 're getting one more .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it 's , about nine hundred dollars for the base station ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then eight hundred per channel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so so the only", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "beyond the mike the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that 's nine hundred dollars .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we should do it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so 'll look into how you daisy - chain them and then just go ahead and order them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't quite understand how that how that works , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we 're not increasing the number of channels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , we 're just replacing the wired the two wired that are still working ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "along with couple of the wired that aren't working , one of the wired that 's not working , with wireless .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "three wireds work ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "three wireds work , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we 've had more problems with that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and that bypasses the whole the whole jimbox thing and all that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and so , we seem to have , reliable way of getting the data in , which is through the ra sony radio mikes ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "as long as we 're conscious about the batteries .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that seems to be the key issue .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "everyone 's battery ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "checked them this morning ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they should be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's the only thing with them .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but the quality seems really good", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "heard from uw that they 're they 're very close to getting their , setup purchased .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "they 're they 're buying something that you can just buy off the shelf .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we should talk to them about it because know that sri is also in the process of looking at ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so , , what we should try to keep everyone on the same page with that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they got sa apparent", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this needs to be bleeped out ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have no clue .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how much of it 's public .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "probably we shouldn't probably we shouldn't talk about funding .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but anyway there 's there 's , other activities that are going on there and and nist and uw .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but but thin that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is quite positive with the sony ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "radio - mikes .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me little is you 're talking about changing the headsets", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "meaning changing the connector , which means some hand - soldering ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we 're having the them do it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it 's so hand - soldering it , but 'm not doing it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , they charge", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "nothing against you and your hand - soldering", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you 've never seen my hand - soldering .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , as said they 're coming in .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", so that 's being done professionally", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "as professionally as you can get it done .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if they do lot of it , it 's", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's just their repair shop .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "their maintenance people .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we 'll see what it 's like .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that tha that can be quite good .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so let 's go with that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and , we 'll see , tomorrow , , what it looks like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , , , dave isn't here but he was going to start working on some things with the digits .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so he 'll be interested in what 's going on with that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "was the decision last time was that the transcribers were going to be doing with the digits as ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "has that started , or is that ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it would be to use his interface and was going to meet with him today about that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , the decision was that jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so did the all that last week .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so all the all the forms are now on the computer .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , then have bunch of scripts that we 'll read those and let the transcribers use different tools .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and want to talk to jane about how we transition to using those .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so he has set up that they", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it it will be efficient for them to do that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "don't 'll take too long .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , , just , matter of few days suspect .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so anyway we have at least one , user for the digits once they get done , which will be dave .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "'ve already done five or six sets .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if he wanted to , , just have few to start with , he could .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also have bunch of scripts that will , like , generate - files and run recognition on them also .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "he might he might be asking", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if dave is on the list ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if he 's invited to these meetings ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if he knows .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "don't tend to get an invitation myself for them even .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we don't have active one", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but 'll make he 's on the list .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "should we call him ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "is he is he definitely not available today ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "should call his office and see ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "he was in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "he 's still taking classes , so , he may have conflicts .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "he wasn't there at cof", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so this might be conflict for him .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "didn't he say his signal - processing class was like tuesdays and thursdays ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "he has class .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "he might have .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you talking about david gelbart ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "he 's taking two twenty - five which is now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , that 's why we 're not seeing him .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "transcriptions , , beyond the digits , where we are , and so on .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and the and the recordings also ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "just where we are .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , should we don't wan wanna do the recording status first , or ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we have about thirty - two hours", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as of , week and half ago ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we probably now have about thirty - five hours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and and that 's that 's", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "how much of that is digits ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's including digits ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's including digits .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "haven't separated it out so have no clue how much of that is digits .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so anyway there 's at least probably thirty hours ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "there 's got to be more than thirty hour", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "of of non - digits ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "of of non - digits .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the digits don't take up that much time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", don't have the exact numbers ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but it would come to about eleven hours that are finished , transcribing from them now .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the next step is to that 'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first , and then channelized .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "what by clean is that they 're spell - checked ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that the mark - up is consistent all the way throughout ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that , liz requested in terms of , in terms of having systematic handling of numbers , and acronyms which hadn't been specific about .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": ", they 'll say \" ninety - two \" .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and , so how you could", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so if you just say \" nine two \" , the there are many ways that could have been expressed .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "an - and had them", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "certain number of them did put the words down ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but now we have convention which also involves having it followed by , , gloss and things .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and you may already be doing this ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but 've noticed in the past that when 've gone through transcriptions and in order to build lexicons and things ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you , just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them , lot of times just scanning down that list you 'll find lot of inconsistencies and mis", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you 're talking about the type token frequency listings , and use those too .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "you mean just on each line there 's one word", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's one token from the from the corpus .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "those are extremely efficient", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and agree that 's very good use of it .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so you already have that ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's that 's way that 's", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the spell - check does that", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "yes , that 's that 's exactly the strategy wanna do in terms of locating these things which are colloquial spoken forms which aren't in the lexicon .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "cuz lot of times they 'll appear next to each other , and ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then you ca then you can do", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "in alphabetized lists , they 'll appear next to each other and so it makes it easier .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's very good that 's very good , suggestion .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and that was that 's my strategy for handling lot of these things , in terms of things that need to be glossed .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "didn't get to that point", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so there are numbers , then there are acronyms ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and then , there 's he she wants the , actually an explicit marker of what type of comment this is ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so curly inside the curly brackets 'm gonna put either \" voc \" for vocalized ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "like cough or like laugh or whatever ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "\" nonvoc \" for door - slam ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and \" gloss \" for things that have to do with if they said spoken form with this this pronunciation error .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "already had that convention", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but haven't been asking these people to do it systematically", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "cuz it most ha most efficiently handled by by filter .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that was what was always planing on .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so that , you get whole long list", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "exactly what you 're saying ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "you get whole list of things that say \" curly bracket laugh curly bracket \" ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "then it 's it 's", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "you you risk less error if you handle it by filter , than if you have this transcriber ch laboriously typing in voc space ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so man so many ways that error prone .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , , 'm 'm going to convert that via filter , into these tagged , subcategorized comments ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and same thing with , we see you get subset when you do what you 're saying ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "you end up with with , you 're collapsing across frequency you just have the tokens", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and you can , have filter which more efficiently makes those changes .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but the numbers and acronyms have to be handled by hand ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because , , jus", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "you what they could be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now timit 's clear and plp is clear", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but there are things that are not so known , in", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "or have variant uses like the numbers you can say \" nine two \" or you can say \" ninety - two \" ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so how are you doing the", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'d handle the numbers individually .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "how are you doing the , acronyms so if say pzm what would it appear on the transcript ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it would be separate", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the letters would be separated in space", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and potentially they 'll have curly bracket thing afterwards", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but 'm not if that 's necessary , clarifying what it is ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so gloss of whatever .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "if that 's really necessary to do that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's thing to do because of it then indicating this is , step away from indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and indicating why they 're there to indicate that it 's the , enumerated , or", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's not good way of saying", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but it 's it 's the specific way of stating these letters .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so it sounds good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so anyway , the clean those are those things", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and then channelized is to then , get it into this multichannel format .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and at that point then it 's ready for use by liz and don .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but that 's been my top priority beyond getting it tanel channelized ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the next step is to work on tightening up the boundaries of the time bins .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and , thilo had breakthrough with this last week in terms of getting the channel - based speech - nonspeech segmentation , up and running", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and haven't haven't been able to use that yet", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "this is my top priority get the data clean , and channelized .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "have you also been doing spot checks , jane ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you see that 's part of the cleaning process .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "actually have segment of ten minutes that was transcribed by two of our transcribers ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and went through it last night , it 's it 's almost spooky how similar these are , word for word .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and there are some differences in commas cuz commas left them discretion at commas .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because it 's not part of our st of our ne needed conventions .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and so they 'll be difference in commas ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but it 's word - by - word the same , in huge patches of the data .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and have ten minute stretch where where show that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has better ear for technical jargon ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and the other one has better ear for colloquial speech .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , the one the colloquial speech person picked up \" gobbledy - gook \" .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and the other one didn't .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and on this side , this one 's picking up things like \" neural nets \" and the one that 's good on the sp on the vocabulary on the colloquial didn't .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "for the person who missed \" gobbledy - gook \" what did they put ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it was an interesting approximation , put in parentheses ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "cuz have this convention that , if they 're not what it was , they put it in parentheses .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so they tried to approximate it , but it was", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it was spelled gabbl", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "how it sounds .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "more of an attempt to", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it was very clear to her that these the this was sound these are the sounds ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it was technical term that she didn't recognize ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but she knew that she didn't .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it was technical ter", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but she even though her technical perception is just really you", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "'ve 'm tempted to ask her if she 's taken any courses in this area or if she 's taken cognitive science courses", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "then cuz \" neural nets \" and she has some things that are \" downsampled \" , she got that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and some of these are rather unexpected .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but ch ten solid ch chunk of ten solid minutes where they both coded the same data .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and the main track that you 're working with is elev eleven hours ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and that 's part of this", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "is that is that including digits ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "yes it is .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so let 's say roughly ten hours or so of", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's probably more than that but with of non - digits .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 'd be more than that", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because my recollection is the minutes that da digits don't take more than half minute . per person .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but the total set that gave them is twelve hours of tape ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but they haven't gotten to the end of that yet .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so they 're still working some of them are two of them are still working on completing that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "boy , they 're moving along .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "- . they 're very efficient .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "there 're some who have more hours that they devote to it than others .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so what what 's the deal with your", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the channel thing ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's just , ran the recognizer , the speech - nonspeech detector on different channels", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , it 's just in in this new multi - channel format and output ,", "speaker": "A"},

.", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that 's one of the main changes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what are some of the other features ? besides the energy ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you said you 're trying some different features , .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "mmm , use our loudness - based things", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "before there were they were some in the log domain and changed this to the to the", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "cu - cube root ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "no , changed this to the to the loudness thingy with the with the", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how do you call it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'m not about the term .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'ll look it up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and say it to you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's that 's the the thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and and tried to normalize the features , there 's loudness and modified loudness , , within one channel ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because they 're , to be able to distinguish between foreground and background speech .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it works quite .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , not always .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let 's see .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "were were you done with", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the transcription part ? so the next thing is this bleep editing .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so the the idea is that we need to have", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they don't want .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so 've written bunch of tools that will generate web pages , with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and piece pieces and they can scroll through and read them ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then , it 's form , html form , so they can submit it and it will end up sending me email with the times that they want excluded .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so , , some of the questions on this is what do we do about the privacy issue .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so about this little bit and the best way to do it is every participant will have password ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "each person will have single password , user name and password .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then each meeting , we 'll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that way each person only has to remember one password .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'t help but wonder if this is little more elaborate than is needed .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "for me would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and would flip through it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then if it was , 'd say \" it 's \" .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it depends how this really ends up working out ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but my thought was that the occasion of somebody wondering whether something was or not and needing to listen to it was gonna be extremely rare .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so the fact that you could listen to it over the web is minor thing that had already done for other reasons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so that 's minor part of it ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wanted some web interface so that people you didn't actually have to send everyone the text .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready , would take them , and generate the web pages", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and just , tell them , \" here 's the web page \" ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "\" you need password \" .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so question number one is how do we distribute the passwords ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and question number two is how else do we wanna provide this information if they want it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what was saying is that if you just say \" here is here is \"", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "this it sounds paleolithic but thought if you handed them some sheets of paper , that said , , \" here 's what was said in this transcription is it with you ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and if it is , here 's this other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it 's \" .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that there are subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then they 'd hand it back to you .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but certainly wouldn't want printout .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "these are big ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and would much rather be ha be able to just sit and leaf through it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you find it easier to go through large", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "how do you read books ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "certainly read books by hand .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but like this , it 's easier to do it on the web .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "cuz you 're gonna get , , if 'm 'm in bunch of meetings and don't wanna get stack of these .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wanna just be able to go to go to the web site and visit it as want .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "going to web site is easy ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but flipping through hundred pounds hundred pages of is not easy on the web .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "don't 's that much harder than , paper .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have one question .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so are you thinking that the person would have transcript and go strictly from the transcript ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because do think that there 's benefit to being able to hear the tone of voice and the", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so here 's the way was imagining it , and 'm wrong ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but the way imagined it was that , the largest set of people is gonna go \" , didn't say anything funny in that meeting", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "just go ahead ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "where 's the where 's the release ? \"", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then there 'll be subset of people ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "think of who it is we 've been recording mostly .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "there 'll be subset of people , who , will say \" , , really would like to see that . \"", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and for them , the easiest way to flip through , if it 's really large document ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "unless you 're searching .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "searching , , should be electronic ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but if you 're not", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so if you provide some search mechanism you go to every place they said something like that ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but see then we 're getting more elaborate with this thing .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if you don't have search mechanisms you just have this really , really long document ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "whenever 've had really , really long document that it was sitting on the web , 've always ended up printing it out .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so it 's it 's", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you 're you 're not necessarily gonna be sitting at the desk all the time ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you wanna figure you have train ride , and there 's all these situations where", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "this is how was imagining it , anyway .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then figured , that out of that group , there would be subset who would go \" 'm really not about this section here , \"", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then that group would need it", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if 'm in that , it seems like you 're setting it up for the most infrequent case , rather than for the most frequent case .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so that , now we have to worry about privacy ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "no fre for the most", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have to worry about all these passwords , for different people", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "for the most frequent case they just say \" it 's \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then they 're done .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and almost everyone would rather do that by email than any other method .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the other thing too is it seems like", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": ", that 's true .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "cuz you don't have to visit the web page if you don't want to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we don't need their signature .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "an email is alright .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that was another thing", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "had assumed that we didn't need their signature , that it that an email approval was sufficient .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but don't actually know .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "are are people going to be allowed to bleep out sections of meeting where they weren't speaking ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if someone feels strongly enough about it , then they should be allowed to do that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that means other people are editing what you say ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the only other choice is that the person would say \" no , don't distribute this meeting \" ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and would rather they were able to edit out other people then just say \" don't distribute it \" .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but what they signed in the consent form , was something that said you can use my voice .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but if someone is having conversation , and you only bleep out one side of it , that 's not sufficient .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that 's our decision then .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because if object to the conversation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if say \" we were having conversation , and consider that conversation private , \" and consider that your side of it is enough for other people to infer , wanna be able to bleep out your side .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "agree that the consent forms were , cons", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "agree with what adam 's saying , that , the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whe whether they said them or didn't say them .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": ", if that 's what it said .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and the other thing is from the standpoint of the", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "'m not law lawyer ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but it strikes me that , we wouldn't want someone to say \" yes , was little concerned about it", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but it was too hard to access \" .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so it 's to have this facility to listen to it .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "now in terms of like editing it by hand , it 's some people would find that easier to specify the bleep part by having document they edited .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but but it seems to me that sometimes , if person had bad day , and they had tone in their voice that they didn't really like , it 's it 's to be able to listen to it and be that was .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "certainly provide printable version if people want it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's also mixture of people ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "some people are do their work primarily by sitting at the computer , flipping around the web ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and others do not .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "others would consider it", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "this set of skills that they would have to gain .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "most of the people in the meetings are the former .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it depends on what meetings .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's true .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "in the meetings so far , .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but we 're trying to expand this ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so actually think that paper is the more universal thing .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but if they want to print it out that 's alright .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "everyone in the meeting can access the web .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , we have to be able to print it out .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's not just if they want to print it out .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so does that mean that 't use email ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "cuz you could send it through email you 're thinking .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "don't think we can send the text through email because of the privacy issues .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so giving them , you think web site to say , \" if you wanna print it out here it is \" , is not sufficient ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "certainly for everybody who 's been in the meetings so far it would be sufficient .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "'m just thinking for people that 's not sufficient for , what the only sufficient thing would be for me to walk up to them and hand it to them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'m just wondering about", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you could mail it to them .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "get an mailing address .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but it 's easier to drop in the box .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "just put the button on the web page which say \" send me the scripts \" .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's interesting .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "when you display it on the web page , what are what are you showing them ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so can they bleep within an utterance ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "whole utterances only .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that was just convenience for my sake , that it 's ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it would end up being fairly difficult to edit the transcripts if we would do it at the sub - utterance level .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because this way just delete an entire line out of transcript file rather than have to do it by hand .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 's another aspect to this which is part of why this is bothering me .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you 're really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do this .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's why did the web form , because for me that would be my most convenient .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "know where you 're going .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's the bad idea .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "see because you 're gon you 're", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you 're gonna end up with all these little patchy things , whereas really what we want to do is have the the bias towards letting it go .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "one or twi once or twice , in the re in the meetings we 've heard , where somebody said something that they might be embarrassed by ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but overall people are talking about technical topics .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "nobody 's gonna get hurt .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "nobody 's being libeled .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "this is this we 're covering", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we 're playing the lawyer 's game , and we 're playing we 're we 're looking for the extreme case .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if we really orient it towards that extreme case , make it really easy , we 're gonna end up encouraging headache .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "'m psyching myself out here ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "don't see having few phrases here and there in meeting being that mu much of headache , bleeped out .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what morgan 's saying is the easier it is , the more is gonna be bleeped .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and and it really depends on what research you 're doing .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "some researchers who are gonna be working with this corpus years from now are really gonna be cursing the fact that there 's bunch of in there that 's missing from the dialogue .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it depends on the research they 're doing ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but it might be , it might be really pain .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and , where it 's really gonna hurt somebody , in some way", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the one who said it or someone who is being spoken about , we definitely want to allow the option of it being bleeped out .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but really think we wanna make it the rare incidence .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and and , am just little worried about making it so easy for people to do ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and so much fun ! that they 're gonna go through and bleep out .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so much fun .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and they can bleep out they don't like too ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "from somebody else , as you say ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so \" didn't like what he said . \"", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "don't see any way of avoiding that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have to provi we have promised that we would provide them the transcript and that they can remove parts that they don't like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , no , don't", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the only question is", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you - you 've talked me into that ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but think that we should make it harder to do .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the problem is if it 's harder for them it 's also harder for me .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "whereas this web interface , get email ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's all formatted ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's all ready to go and just insert it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you don't give them access to the web interface unless they really need it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so so this is way out of it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you 've provided something that 's useful for you to do handle ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and useful for someone else if they need it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but the issue of privacy and ease and should be that , they get access to this if they really need it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so you 're saying the sequence would be more like first adam goes to the contact lists , contacts them via whatever their preferred method is , to see if they want to review the meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then if they don't , you 're done .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if they do , then he provides them access to the web site .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to some extent have to do that anyway because as said we have to distribute passwords .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or printed - out form .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you don't necessarily have to distribute passwords is what 'm saying .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "only if they want it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what 'm saying is that 't just email them the password because that 's not secure .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so they have to call me and ask .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but you aren't necessarily giving them", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but we don't even necessarily need to end up distributing passwords .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we do because of privacy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can't just make it openly available on the web .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you 're missing the point .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we 're we 're trying we 're trying to make it less of an obvious just fall off log , to do this .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "not everyone gets password , unless they ask for it .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so so what would see , is that first you contact them and ask them if they would like to review it for to check for the", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "not just for fun ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but to check this for things that they 're worried about having said or if they 're willing to just send an approval of it , at from their memory .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and , , and we should think carefully actually we should review go through how that 's worded ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "then , if someone wants to review it , ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and know you don't like this , but 'm offering this as suggestion , is that is that we then give them print out .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then if they say that \" have potential problem with these things , \" then , you say \" you might wanna hear this in context to you need that , \" you issue them password , in the", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but the problem with what you 're suggesting is it 's not just inconvenient for them , it 's inconvenient for me .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because that means multiple contacts every time for every single meeting every time anyone wants anything .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would much prefer to have all be automatic , they visit the web site if they want to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they don't have to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "know you 'd prefer it , but the proble", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so you 're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping and don't think that 's gonna happen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 's problem with it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "'m also concerned about the spirit of the of the informed consent thing .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "cuz if they feel that , it 's", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "if it turns out that something gets published in this corpus that someone really should have eliminated and didn't detect , then it could have been because of their own negligence that they didn't pursue that next level and get the password and do that ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but they might be able to argue \" it was cumbersome , and was busy and it was gonna take me too much time to trace it down \" .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so it could that the burden would come back onto us .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so 'm little bit worried about , making it harder for them , from the legal standpoint .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "you can go too far in that direction , and you need to find somewhere between ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it seems to me that sending them email , saying \" if you have an - reply to this email and say ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you have problem with it contact me and 'll give you password \" ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "seems like is perfectly , reasonable compromise .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if they want printout they can print it out themselves .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or we could print it up for them ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we could offer that", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but there 's , another aspect to that and that is that in the informed consent form , , my impression is that they that we offered them at the very least that they definitely would have access to the transcript .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that there 's chance of really skipping that stage .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text":
