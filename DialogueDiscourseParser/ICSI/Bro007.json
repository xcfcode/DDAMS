[{"edus": [{"text": "today we 're looking at number of things we 're trying", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and fortunately for listeners to this we lost some of it 's visual", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but got tables in front of us .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what is what does combo mean ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so combo is system where we have these features that go through network", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then this same string of features but low - pass filtered with the low - pass filter used in the msg features .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so these low - pass filtered goes through another mlp", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then the linear output of these two mlp 's are combined just by adding the values and then there is this klt .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the output is used as features as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so let me try to restate this and see if have it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there is there is the features there 's the ogi features and then those features go through contextual", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let 's take this bottom arr one pointed to by the bottom arrow .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "those features go through contextualized klt .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then these features also get low - pass filtered", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "could perhaps draw this on the blackboard", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we have these features from ogi that goes through the three paths .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the first is klt using several frames of the features .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the second path is mlp also using nine frames several frames of features", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the third path is this low - pass filter .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "adding the outputs just like in the second propose the proposal from for the first evaluation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then the klt and then the two together again .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , the klt .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and those two together .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that 's that 's this bottom one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so and then the the one at the top", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and presume these things that are in yellow because overall they 're the best ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's the reason , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let 's focus on them then", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what 's the block diagram for the one above it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for the first yellow line you mean ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it 's the same except that we don't have this low - pass filtering so we have only two streams .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 's there 's no low - pass processing used as additional feature stream .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you they mentioned made some when was on the phone with sunil they mentioned some weighting scheme that was used to evaluate all of these numbers .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "actually the way things seems to", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's forty percent for ti - digit , sixty for all the speechdat - cars ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "all these languages .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ehm the match is forty , medium thirty five and high mismatch twenty - five .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we don't have the ti - digits part yet ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "generally what you observe with ti - digits is that the result are very close whatever the system .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so have you put all these numbers together into single number representing that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that should be pretty easy to do and that would be good", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then we could compare the two and say what was better .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and how does this compare to the numbers", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so ogi two is just the top row ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "actually ogi two is the baseline with the ogi features", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but this is not exactly the result that they have because they 've they 're still made some changes in the features", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and but actually our results are better than their results .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "by how much because they did not send us the new results", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the one place where it looks like we 're messing things up bit is in the highly mismatched italian .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there is something funny happening here because", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but there are thirty - six and then sometimes we are we are around forty - two and", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so one of the ideas that you had mentioned last time was having second silence detection .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so there are some results here", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for the italian .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the third and the fifth line of the table", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for this one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so filt is what that is ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it seems for the match and mismatched condition", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's it brings something .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but actually there are there 's no room left for any silence detector at the server side because of the delay .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can't do it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for that for that we", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "good idea , but can't do it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "except because they they are still working .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "two days ago they were still working on this trying to reduce the delay of the silence detector", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we had time perhaps we could try to find some compromise between the delay that 's on the handset and on the server side .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "perhaps try to reduce the delay on the handset", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but for the moment they have this large delay on the feature computation and so we don't", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "alright so for now at least that 's not there", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have some results with low - pass filter cepstrum", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "doesn't have huge effect but it but it looks like it could help in couple places .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and let 's see", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what else did we have in there ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it makes at this point this is", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "should probably look at these others little bit", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you yellowed these out", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "see that one you can't use because of the delay .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "those look pretty good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let 's see that one", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "even the just the second row doesn't look that bad ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and and that looks like an interesting one too .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "actually the the second line is like the first line in yellow", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "except that we don't have this klt on the first on the left part of the diagram .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we just have the features as they are .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so when we do this weighted measure we should compare the two cuz it might even come out better .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it 's it 's little slightly simpler .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so so there 's so would put that one also as as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it 's actually does significantly better on the highly mismatched italian ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and little worse on the mis on the case ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's worse than few things", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so let 's see how that see how that comes out on their measure", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and are we running this for ti - digits", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now is ti di is that part of the result that they get for the development the results that they 're supposed to get at the end of end of the month , the ti - digits are there also ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's included , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and see what else there is here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the one was looking down here at the the row below the lower yellowed one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's that 's with the reduced klt size reduced dimensionality .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what happens there is it 's around the same", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so you could reduce the dimension as you were saying before bit perhaps .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's it 's significantly worse but - .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's significantly worse", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's it 's it 's it 's mostly worse .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "exc - except for the", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for many mismatch it 's worse .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it is little .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not by huge amount ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what are what are the sizes of any of these sets ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'m 'm you told me before , but 've forgotten .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so how many words are in one of these test sets ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's it depends the matched is generally larger than the other sets", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it 's around two thousand or three thousand words perhaps , at least .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but words word .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the words , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "some sets have five hundred sentences ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the so the sets so the test sets are between five hundred and two thousand sentences , let 's say", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and each sentence on the average has four or five digits", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or is it most of them longer or", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for the italian even seven digits more or less", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but sometime the sentence have only one digit", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and sometime like the number of credit cards , something like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so between one and sixteen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "see the the reason 'm asking is is we have all these small differences and how to take them , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if you had just to give an example , if you had if you had thousand words then tenth of percent would just be one word ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so so it wouldn't mean anything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it be 'd like to the sizes of these test sets were actually .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the size that we have ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could we could run some significance tests", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also just to know the numbers ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so these are word error rates", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is on how many words .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have the result that the output of the htk", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the number of sentences , no it 's the number isn't .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so anyway if you could just mail out what those numbers are and then that be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what else is there here ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "see the second from the bottom it says sil ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but this is some different silence or thing or", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what was that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it the output silence of the mlp .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's only one small experiment to happened .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to apply also to in include also the silence of the mlp we have the fifty - six form and the silence to pick up the silence and we include those .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "- , - .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the silence plus the klt output ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you 're only using the silence .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because when we apply the klt", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no they 're there is this silence in addition to the klt outputs", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in addition , yes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it is because we we just keep we don't keep all the dimensions after the klt", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we not we are not if we pick we have the silence .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we try to add the silence also in addition to the these twenty - eight dimensions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and what and what 's ogi forty - five ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the bottom one there ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's it 's ogi two ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's so the it 's the features from the first line", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's ogi two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but what 's the what does the last row mean ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it 's this but without the klt on the from the left path .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that was the one that was the second row .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what 's the difference between the second", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the second line you don't have this combo so you just", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is like the second line but with the combo .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and with the all the output of the combo .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it looks to me the same", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "given that we have to take the filt ones out of the running because of this delay problem so it looks to me like the ones you said agree are the ones to look at", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but would add the the second row one", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then if we can", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "also when they 're using this weighting scheme of forty , thirty - five , twenty - five is that on the percentages or on the raw errors ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's probably on the percentages ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's not clear here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they 'll argue about it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if we can how many words are in each", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then dave dave promised to get us something tomorrow which will be there as far as they 've gotten friday", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then we 'll operate with that", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and how long did it", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we 're not doing all these things if we 're only doing", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "since this is development data it 's legitimate to do more than one ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ordinarily if in final test data you don't want to do several and take the best", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's that 's not proper", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if this is development data we could still look at couple .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we have to decide", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have to fix the system on this on this data , to choose the best", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the question is when do we fix the system ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do we fix the system tomorrow or do we fix the system on tuesday ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "except that we do have to write it up .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we fixed on tuesday , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's this with perhaps some printing and some other @ @ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what we do is we we as soon as we get the data from them we start the training and", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we start the write - up away because as you say there 's only minor differences between these .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you we could start soon , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "write up something .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and would , would 'd like to see it", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the my what in this si in this situation is my forte which is english .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have have you seen alt do they have format for how they want the system descriptions or anything ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there is the format of the table which is quite impressive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , for those who are listening to this and not looking at it it 's not really that impressive , it 's just tiny .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's all these little categories set , set , set , multi - condition , clean .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do what no what no mitigation means here ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it should be the problem with the error channel error", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's probably the", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is probably channel error", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is , it says above here channel error resilience ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so recognition performance is just the top part , actually .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and they have yes , split between seen databases and non - seen so between development and evaluation .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's presumed there 's all sorts of tuning that 's gone on the see what they call seen databases", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and there won't be tuning for the unseen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "multi - condition multi - condition .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so they have looks like they have", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so they splitting up between the ti - digits and everything else , see .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the everything else is the speechdat - car , that 's the multi multilingual", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it 's not divided between languages you mean or", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but there 's also there 's these tables over here for the for the ti - digits and these tables over here for the car data", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is which is all the multilingual", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then there 's they also split up between multi - condition and clean only .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for ti - digits .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for the ti - digits they want to train on clean and on noisy", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we 're doing that also , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do we have the features ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for the clean ti - digits but we did not test it yet .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the clean training .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "anyway , sounds like there 'll be lot to do just to work with our partners to fill out the tables over the next next few days", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they have to send it out", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let 's see the thirty - first is wednesday", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the it has to be there by some hour european time on wednesday", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we lost time wednesday because that the difference in the time may be is long different of the time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the thursday the twelfth of the night of the thurs - thirty - one is not valid in europe .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we is happening .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , so we have to actually get it done tuesday", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "except if it 's the thirty - one at midnight", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can still do some work on wednesday morning .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is but is it midni it was actually something like five pm on", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was like it was five pm ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "didn't was midnight .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they said they wanted everything by", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so five pm their time is", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not five pm , three pm .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright , that 's six in the morning here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "three - three pm ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , we are wondering about the the hour that we have to", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it 's three pm it 's", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "three pm here is in europe midnight .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's it 's midnight but", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , yes , but didn't was midnight that it was due ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it was due at some hour during the day like five pm .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "- . - ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we should look", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but my assumption is that we have to be done tuesday .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so then next thursday we can have little aftermath", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but then we 'll actually have the new data which is the german and the danish", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that really will be much less work because the system will be fixed", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so all we 'll do is take whatever they have and and run it through the process .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we won't be changing the training on anything", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so there 'll be no new training , there 'll just be new htk runs ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that 's means in some sense we can relax from this after tuesday", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and next meeting we can start talking little bit about where we want to go from here in terms of the research .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what things did you think of when you were doing this process that you just didn't really have time to adequately work on", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "stephane always has these ideas", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we don't have time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'m not these are ideas .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but they 're ideas .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that was good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and and also it 's still true that it 's true that we at least got fairly consistent improved results by running the neural net transformation in parallel with the features", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "rather than in sequence which was your suggestion and that that seems to have been borne out .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the fact that none of these are , enormous is is not too surprising", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "most improvements aren't enormous", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "some of them are", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you have something really wrong and you fix it you can get big and really enormous improvements", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but cuz our best improvements over the years that we 've gotten from finding bugs ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "see where we are and everybody knows what they 're doing and is there is there anything else we should talk about", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or are we done ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we will we 'll try to focus on these three architectures", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and perhaps was thinking also fourth one with just single klt", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because we did not really test that", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "removing all these klt 's and putting one single klt at the end .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that would be pretty low maintenance to try it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you can fit it in .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have do have one other piece of information which should tell people outside of this group too", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we 're gonna need it but jeff up at the university of washington has gotten hold of some server farm of of ten multiprocessor ibm machines rs six thousands", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so each one is four processors or , eight hundred megahertz", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and there 's four processors in box and there 's ten boxes and there 's some ti", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if he 's got lot of processing power", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we 'd have to schedule it", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if we have some big jobs and we wanna wanna run them he 's he 's offering it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "when he was here he used not only every machine here but every machine on campus as far as could tell ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so in some ways he just got his payback ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but again if we 'll end up with if we 're gonna be cpu limited on anything that we 're doing in this group", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if we are that 's an offer .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you doing so that 's that 's really neat", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we 'll don't think we need to", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the other thing that will say is that the digits that we 're gonna record momentarily is starting to get are starting to get into pretty good size collection", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and in addition to the speechdat we will have those to work with really pretty soon now", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that 's that 's another source of data .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is under somewhat better control and that we can we can make measurements of the room", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the that if we feel there 's other measurements we don't have that we 'd like to have we can make them", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "dave and were just talking about that little while ago", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that 's another possibility for this work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if nobody has
