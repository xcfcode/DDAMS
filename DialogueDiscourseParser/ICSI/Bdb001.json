definitely .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so it definitely had that as concept .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so tha it has single time - line ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then you can have lots

time", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "my question is more , , what what do you do with , say , forced alignment ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "you 've got all these phone labels ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and what do you do if you just conceptually , if you get , , transcriptions where the words are staying but the time boundaries are changing , cuz you 've got new recognition output ,",

- stamps in the time - line without , , changing the ds .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you 'd be able to propagate all of the information ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that 's , the who that 's

for phone - level , , what would that look like ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "would use just an existing an existing way of doing it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how would you ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but but why not use it for phone - level ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's just matter of it 's just matter of it being bigger .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if you have", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "barring memory limitations , or this is still the", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's parsing limitations .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't want to have this text file that you have to read in the whole thing to do something very simple for .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you would use it only for purposes where you actually want the phone - level information , 'd imagine .",

word - level , this would be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for word - level , it 's alright .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for lower than word - level , you 're talking about so much data that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , one thing that don is doing , is we 're we 're running for every frame , you get pitch value ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "lattices are big , too .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and not only one pitch value but different kinds of pitch values", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": ", like that would use - file", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or any frame - level would use - file .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's , like it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's ics , icsi has format for frame - level representation of features .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that you could call that you would tie into this representation with like an id .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "or or there 's there 's particular way in xml to refer to external resources .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you would say \" refer to this external file \" .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that external file wouldn't be in", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that might that might work .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but what 's the advantage of doing that versus just putting it into this format ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which is better .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you did it at this", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "these are long meetings", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and with for every frame ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "you don't want to do it with that", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "anything at frame - level you had better encode binary", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or it 's gonna be really painful .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or you just compre", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like text formats .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can always , , - zip them ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , , , decompress them on the fly if if space is really concern .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was thinking the advantage is that we can share this with other people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but if you 're talking about one per frame , you 're talking about gigabyte - size files .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you 're gonna actually run out of space in your filesystem for one file .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "these are big files .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because you have two - gigabyte limit on most ss .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so frame - level is probably not good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but for phone - level it 's perfectly", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like phones , or syllables , or anything like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "phones are every five frames though ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but but most of the frames are actually not speech .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "look at it , words times the average the average number of phones in an english word is , , five ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , look at it , number of words times five .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's not that not", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you mean pause phones take up lot of the", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "long pause phones .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that 's true .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but you do have to keep them in there .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so it 's debatable whether you want to do phone - level in the same thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , anything at frame - level , even - file , is too verbose .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would use something tighter than - files .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you are you familiar with it ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "haven't seen this particular format ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "'ve 've used them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what their structure is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'ve forgot what the str", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , minute ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "- file for each frame is storing vector of cepstral or plp values ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's whatever you want , actually .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that what 's about the - file it", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "built into it is the concept of frames , utterances , sentences , that thing , that structure .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then also attached to it is an arbitrary vector of values .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it can take different types .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it they don't all have to be floats .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can have integers and you can have doubles , and all that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that sounds that sounds about what", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and it has header it has header format that describes it to some extent .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the only problem with it is it 's actually storing the utterance numbers and the frame numbers in the file ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "even though they 're always sequential .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so it does waste lot of space .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it 's still lot tighter than ascii .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we have lot of tools already to deal with it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is there some documentation on this somewhere ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "there 's ton of it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "man - pages and , , source code , and me .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that sounds good .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "'m not database person ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but something standard enough that , , if we start using this we can give it out ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "other people can work on it ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's not standard .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or is it ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's something that we developed at icsi .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it 's been used here", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but it 's been used here", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , , we have - configured system that you can distribute for free ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it must be the equivalent of whatever you used to store feat your computed features in , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "actually , we use generalization of the sphere format .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so there is something like that", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it 's , , probably not as sophist", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what does do for features ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or does it even have concept of features ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they ha it has its own", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "entropic has their own feature format that 's called , like , - sd or some so sf like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'m just wondering , would it be worth while to use that instead ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "- this is exactly the decision it 's just whatever", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but , , people don't typically share this , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they generate their own .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "actually , , we 've done this on prosodics", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and three or four places have asked for those prosodic files ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and we just have an ascii , , output of frame - by - frame .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "which is fine ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but it gets unwieldy to go in and query these files with really huge files .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we could do it .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "was just thinking if there 's something that where all the frame values are", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and , if you have", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you have two - hour - long meeting , that 's gonna", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they 're they 're fair they 're quite large .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": ", they 'd be emo enormous .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and these are for ten - minute switchboard conversations ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so it 's doable ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's just that you can only store feature vector at frame - by - frame", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and it doesn't have any ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "is is the sharing part of this pretty important consideration", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or does that just , thing to have ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "enough about what we 're gonna do with the data .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but it would be good to get something that we can that other people can use or adopt for their own kinds of encoding .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and just , we have to use some we have to make some decision about what to do .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and especially for the prosody work , what it ends up being is you get features from the signal ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and those change every time your alignments change .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so you re - run recognizer ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "you want to recompute your features , , and then keep the database up to date .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "or you change word , or you change utterance boundary segment , which is gonna happen lot .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and so wanted something where all of this can be done in elegant way", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and that if somebody wants to try something or compute something else , that it can be done flexibly .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it doesn't have to be pretty ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it just has to be , , easy to use , and", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we should look at atlas ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the nist thing ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and see if they have anything at that level .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'m not what to do about this with atlas ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because they chose different route .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "- there are two choices .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "your your file format can know about know that you 're talking about language and speech , which is what chose , and time ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or your file format can just be graph representation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then the application has to impose the structure on top .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what it looked like atlas chose is , they chose the other way ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which was their file format is just nodes and links ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you have to interpret what they mean yourself .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and why did you not choose that type of approach ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because knew that we were doing speech ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it was better if you 're looking at raw file to be for the tags to say \" it 's an utterance \" , as opposed to the tag to say \" it 's link \" .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but other than that , are they compatible ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "they 're reasonably compatible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you could probably translate between them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the other thing is if we choose to use atlas , which we should just do , we should just throw this out before we invest lot of time in it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is what the meeting 's about ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "cuz we need to come up with database like this just to do our work .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and actually don't care , as long as it 's something useful to other people , what we choose .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so it 's oth ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "if you have any idea of how to choose , cuz don't .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "do they already have tools ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "chose this for couple reasons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one of them is that it 's easy to parse .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you don't need full xml parser .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's very easy to just write perl script to parse it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as long as each tag is on one line .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which always do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you can have as much information in the tag as you want ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "have it structured .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so each type tag has only particular items that it can take .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can you but you can add to those structures if you", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "if you have more information .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what what nist would say is that instead of doing this , you would say something like \" link {nonvocalsound} start equals , , , some node id ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "end equals some other node id \" ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then \" type \" would be \" utterance \" .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it 's very similar .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so why would it be waste to do it this way if it 's similar enough that we can always translate it ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it probably wouldn't be waste .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it would mean that at some point if we wanted to switch , we 'd just have to translate everything .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "since they are developing big", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it but that sounds", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "don't think that 's big deal .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as long as it is", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "they 're developing big infrastructure .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so it seems to me that if we want to use that , we might as go directly to what they 're doing , rather than", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we want to", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do they already have something that 's that would be useful for us in place ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see , that 's the question .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how stable is their", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are they ready to go ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the looked at it", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the last time looked at it was while ago ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "probably year ago ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when we first started talking about this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and at that time at least it was still not very complete .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so , specifically they didn't have any external format representation at that time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they just had the conceptual node , annotated transcription graph ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which really liked .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that 's exactly what this is based on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "since then , they 've developed their own external file format ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which is , , , this this thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they 've also developed lot of tools ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but haven't looked at them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should we should find out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would the tools would the tools run on something like this , if you can translate them anyway ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "what would what would worry me is that we might miss little detail", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that it 's question that", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that would make it very difficult to translate from one to the other .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it 's conceptually close , and they already have or will have tools that everybody else will be using , , it would be crazy to do something , separate that", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we might as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so 'll 'll take closer look at it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that would really be the question , is just what you would feel is in the long run the best thing .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "cuz once we start , , doing this don't we don't actually have enough time to probably have to rehash it out again", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the other thing the other way that established this was as easy translation to and from the transcriber format .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is intuitively easy to actually read ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "as easy it could as it could be .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "suppose that as long as they have type here that specifies \" utt \" ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's almost the same .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's , close enough that", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the with this , though , is that you can't really add any supplementary information .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if you suddenly decide that you want", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have to make different type .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "you 'd have to make different type .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you look at it", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "in my mind enough jane would know better , about the types of annotations", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and but imagine that those are things that would , you mentioned this , that could span any", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it could be in its own channel ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it could span time boundaries of any type ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it could be instantaneous ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "things like that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and then from the recognition side we have backtraces at the phone - level .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "if if it can handle that , it could handle states or whatever .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and then at the prosody - level we have frame like cepstral feature files ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "like these - files or anything like that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and that 's the world of things that", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and then we have the aligned channels , ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it seems to me you want to keep the frame - level separate .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and wanted to find actually nicer format or more compact format than what we used before .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "just cuz you 've got ten channels or whatever and two hours of meeting .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's it 's lot of", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "now now how would you how would you represent , , multiple speakers in this framework ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "were you would just represent them as", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you would have like speaker tag ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there 's spea speaker tag up at the top which identifies them", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then each utt", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the way had it is each turn or each utterance , don't even remember now , had speaker id tag attached to it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and in this format you would have different tag ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which would , , be linked to the link .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so so somewhere else you would have another thing that would be ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let 's see , would it be node or link ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so this one would have , , an id is link seventy - four

{"text": "it 's , there 're two ways of doing it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it would just be floating before the sentence or floating after the sentence without time - mark .", "speaker": "F"},

that you can do that ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but 'm forgetting the exact level of nesting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , you would have to have two different pointers from the word up one

particular tag that has this particular text in it , , and , , refers to particular value .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so the point isn't that an end - user , who is looking for query like you

{"text": "and especially that the representation doesn't have to be thrown away ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "even if your tools change .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and so it seems to me that", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have to look at it again to see whether it can really do what we want ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if we use the atlas external file representation , , it seems like it 's rich enough that you could do quick tools just as said in perl ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then later on if we choose to go up the learning curve , we can use the whole atlas inter infrastructure ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that sounds good to me .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "which has all that built in .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you would look at that and let us you think .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we 're guinea pigs ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "cuz want to get the prosody work done", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but don't want to waste time , , getting the",

of this data is the word sequence ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or the time .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "or the times .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , see , if you 'd annotate dialogue acts , you don't necessarily want to or topics you don't really want to be dealing with time - marks .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you 'd it 's much more efficient for them to just see the word sequence , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "most people aren't as sophisticated as we are here with , , , time alignments and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should should we mention some names on the people who are ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the my point is that you 're gonna end up with , , word sequences that are differently annotated .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you want some tool , , that is able to merge these different annotations back into single , , version .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we had this problem very massively , , at sri when we worked , , while back on , , on dialogue acts as as , , ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what was it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "all the switchboard in it .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "there 's , , automatic , , punctuation and like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because we had one set of annotations that were based on , , one version of the transcripts with particular segmentation ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we had another version that was based on , , different slightly edited version of the transcripts with different segmentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , we had these two different versions which were , you could tell they were from the same source but they weren't identical .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it was extremely hard to reliably merge these two back together to correlate the information from the different annotations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't see any way that file formats are gonna help us with that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's it 's all question of semantic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but once you have file format , imagine writing not personally , but someone writing tool that is essentially an alignment tool , , that mediates between various versions ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , like , , you have this thing in unix where you have , , diff .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "- diff or diff .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "there 's the , , diff that actually tries to reconcile different two diffs based on the same original .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it - diff ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "something like that ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but operating on these lattices that are really what 's behind this , this annotation format .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there 's actually diff library you can use to do things like that so you have different formats .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you could definitely do that with the", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so somewhere in the api you would like to have like merge or some function that merges two versions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's gonna be very hard .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "any structured anything when you try to merge is really , really hard", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the hard part isn't the file format .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the hard part is specifying what you mean by \" merge \" .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that 's very difficult .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the one thing that would work here actually for that is more reliable than the utterances is the speaker ons and offs .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so if you have good ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but this is exactly what , is that the problem", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you just have to know wha what to tie it to .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the problem is saying \" what are the semantics ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what do you mean by \" merge \" ? \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so so just to let what we where we kluged it by , , doing , by doing hhh .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "both were based on words ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , bo we have two versions of the same words intersp , sprinkled with different tags for annotations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then you did diff .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we did diff .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's just what .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that 's how", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's just wh how would have done it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , , it had lots of errors", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and things would end up in the wrong order , and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you had more", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because it was reducing everything to , , to textual alignment .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "isn't that something where whoever if the people who are making changes , say in the transcripts , cuz this all happened when the transcripts were different ye , if they tie it to something , like if they tied it to the acoustic segment if they", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "then or if they tied it to an acoustic segment and we had the time - marks , that would help .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but the problem is exactly as adam said , that you get , , you don't have that information or it 's lost in the merge somehow ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "can ask one question ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it it seems to me that , , we will have an official version of the corpus , which will be only one version in terms of the words where the words are concerned .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we 'd still have the merging issue if coding were done independently of the", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and you 're gonna get that", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because if the data gets out , people will do all kinds of things to it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , , , several years from now you might want to look into , , the prosody of referring expressions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and someone at the university of who knows where has annotated the referring expressions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you want to get that annotation and bring it back in line with your data .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but unfortunately they 've also hand - edited it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but they 've also", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and so that 's exactly what we should somehow when you distribute the data , say that , that have some way of knowing how to merge it back in and asking people to try to do that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "what 's what 's wrong with doing times ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that was what was wondering .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": ", time is the", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "time is unique .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you were saying that you didn't think we should", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "time is passing !", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "time time times are ephemeral .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what if they haven't notated with them , times ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "he he 's language modeling person , though .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "his example is good one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "imagine that this person who developed the corpus of the referring expressions didn't include time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "he included references to words .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "he said that at this word is when it happened .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then couldn't you just indirectly figure out the time tied to the word ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but what if what if they change the words ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you 'd have some anchoring point .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "he couldn't have changed all the words .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but can they change the words without changing the time of the word ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but they could have changed it little .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the , that they may have annotated it off word transcript that isn't the same as our word transcript ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so how do you merge it back in ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "understand what you 're saying .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the answer is , , it 's gonna be different every time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's it 's just gonna be", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's exactly what said before ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you only know the boundaries of the", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "which is that \" what do you mean by \" merge \" ? \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so in this case where you have the words and you don't have the times , , what do you mean by \" merge \" ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you tell me what you mean , write program to do it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can merge at the level of the representation that the other person preserved and that 's it .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and that 's about all you can do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and beyond that , all is relative ordering", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and sometimes even that is wrong .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so so in this one you would have to do best match between the word sequences ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "extract the times from the best match of theirs to yours ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and use that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then infer that their time - marks are somewhere in between .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but it could be that they just , , it could be that they chunked they lost certain utterances and all that ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so it could get very ,
