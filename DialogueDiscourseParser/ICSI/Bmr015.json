have anything .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so , does anyone have any agenda items other than me ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "actually have one more also which is to talk about the digits .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", so was just gonna talk briefly about the nsf itr .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then , you have", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "won't say much ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , but then , , you said wanna talk about digits ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have short thing about digits", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then wanna talk little bit about naming

"speaker": "F"}, {"text": "if we , we shouldn't add things in just to add things in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'m actually pretty busy today ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if we can we", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "short meeting would be fine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this does sound like we 're doing fine ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that won't do .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so the only thing wanna say about digits is , we are done with the first test set .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there are probably forms here and there that are marked as having been read that weren't really read .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so won't really know until go through all the transcriber forms", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and extract out pieces that are in error .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so wa . two things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the first is what should we do about digits that were misread ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my opinion is , , we should just throw them out completely ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and have them read again by someone else .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the grouping is completely random ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it 's perfectly fine to put group together again", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and have them re - read ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just to finish out the test set .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "! by throw them out completely ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the other thing you could do is change the transcript to match what they really said .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so those are those are the two options .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but there 's often things where people do false starts .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'ve done it , where say", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what the transcribers did with that is if they did correction , and they eventually did read the string , you extract the string .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you 're talking about where they completely read the wrong string and didn't correct it ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and didn't notice .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which happens in few places .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and and you 're talking string - wise ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "you 're not talking about the entire page ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and so the two options are change the transcript to match what they really said ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but then but then the transcript isn't the aurora test set anymore .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't think that really matters", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because the conditions are so different .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that would be little easier .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how many are how often does that happen ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "mmm , five or six times .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it 's not very much .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "no , it 's not much .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "seems like we should just change the transcripts", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's five or six times out of thousands ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "four thous ! four thousand .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would , , tak do the easy way ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it it 's kinda", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wh who knows what studies people will be doing on speaker - dependent things", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so having it all", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the speakers who we had is at least interesting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you , how many digits have been transcribed now ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "four thousand lines .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and each line is between one and about ten digits .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "four thousand lines ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "didn't didn't compute the average .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the average was around four or five .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that 's couple hours of , , speech , probably .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which is reasonable test set .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , jane , do have set of forms which you have copies of somewhere .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "- . , true .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "- . - .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "had all of them back from you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then the other thing is that , , the forms in front of us here that we 're gonna read later , were suggested by liz", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , not yet .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because she wanted to elicit some different prosodics from digits .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so , , wanted people to , take quick look at the instructions", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "eight eight two nine .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and the way it wa worked and see if it makes sense", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if anyone has any comments on it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the decision here , , was to continue with the words rather than the numerics .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "although we could switch it back .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the problem was and zero .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "although we could switch it back and tell them always to say \" zero \" or always to say \" \" .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it 's just two thing ways that you can say it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's the only thought have", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because if you start talking about these , tr", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "she 's trying to get at natural groupings ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it there 's nothing natural about reading numbers this way .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you saw telephone number you would never see it this way .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the the problem also is she did want to stick with digits .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'m speaking for her since she 's not here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , , the other problem we were thinking about is if you just put the numerals , they might say forty - three instead of four three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if there 's space , though , between them .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "with when you space them out they don't look like , , forty - three anymore .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "she and were talking about it ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and she felt that it 's very , very natural to do that chunking .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "she 's . it 's it 's different problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's it 's an interesting problem", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we 've done with numbers before ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you say \" three nine eight one \" sometimes people will say \" thirty - nine eighty - one \"", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or \" three hundred three hundred eighty - nine one \" ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or don't think they 'd say that ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , they certainly could .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "thirty - eight ninety - one is probably how they 'd do it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so . , this is something that liz and spoke about", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , since this was something that liz asked for specifically , we need to defer to her .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", we 're probably gonna be collecting meetings for while", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if we decide we still wanna do some digits later we might be able to do some different ver different versions ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do something different ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but this is the next suggestion ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , let me , , get my short thing out about the nsf .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually this is little side thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "sent to what we had , , in some previous mail , as the joint thing to send to ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which was \" mtg rcdr hyphen joint \" .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then got some funny mail saying that the moderator was going to", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's because they set the one up at uw", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's not on our side , that 's on the - dub side .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so - uw set it up as moderated list .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , have no idea whether it actually ever goes to anyone", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you might just wanna mail to mari", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no no , got got , , little excited notes from mari and jeff and so on ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the moderator actually did repost it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "cuz had sent one earlier", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "actually the same thing happened to me had sent one earlier .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the message says , \" you 'll be informed \"", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then was never informed", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but got replies from people indicating that they had gotten it ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's just to prevent spam .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so . , anyway , everybody here are are", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you are on that list ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you got the note ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this was , , , , proposal that we put in", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "before on more higher level , , issues in meetings ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "from higher level from my point of view .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , , meeting mappings ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so is for it was proposal for the itr program ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "information technology research program 's part of national science foundation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's the second year of their doing , , these grants .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they 're they 're", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "lot of them are", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "some of them anyway , are larger grants than the usual , small nsf grants ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , they 're very competitive ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and they have first phase where you put in pre - proposals ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we , , got through that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so the next phase will be we 'll actually be doing larger proposal .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and 'm hope to be doing very little of it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which was also true for the pre - proposal ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there 'll be bunch of people working on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when 's when 's the full proposal due ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "april ninth , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it 's about month .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and they said end of business day you could check on the reviewer forms ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "march second , said .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'ve been day off all week .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's good thing", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "cuz that way got my papers done early .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it would be interesting", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so that 's amazing you showed up at this meeting !", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it is . it is actually quite amazing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 'll be interesting to see the reviewer 's comments .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "my favorite is was when when one reviewer says , , \" , this should be far more detailed \" ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the nex the next reviewer says , \" , there 's way too much detail \" .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or \" this is way too general \" ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the other reviewer says , \" this is way

"there 'll be something useful .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it sounded like they the first gate was pretty easy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that they didn't reject lot of the pre - proposals ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do anything about the numbers ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's just from his message it sounded like that .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "said something , .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "there was sentence at the end of one of his paragraphs", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "should go back and look .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "didn't don't think that 's true .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "he said the next phase 'll be very , competitive", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "because we didn't want to weed out much in the first phase .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we 'll have to see what the numbers are .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but they have to weed out enough so that they have enough reviewers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , , , they didn't weed out as much as usual ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it 's it 's usually pretty", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's it 's certainly not 'm that it 's not down to one in two", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "of what 's left .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'m it 's ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how how many awards are there ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there 's different numbers of awards for different size", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they have three size grants .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this one there 's ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see the small ones are less than five hundred thousand total over three years", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that they have fair number of them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the large ones are ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "boy , forget ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "more than million and half , more than two million like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and and we 're in the middle", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "forget what it was .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it 's pr probably along the li", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "could be wrong on this", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but probably along the lines of fifteen or that they 'll fund , or twenty .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when they do you do how many they funded when they in chuck 's ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that he got last year ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it was smaller ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that it was like four or five ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it doesn't matter ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we 'll find out one way or another .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "last time they just had two categories ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "small and big ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and this time they came up with middle one ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it 'll there 'll be more of them that they fund than of the big .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we end up getting this , , what will it mean to icsi in terms of , wh where will the money go to ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "what would we be doing with it ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "exactly what we say in the proposal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which part is icsi though .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "none of it will go for those yachts that we 've talking about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , it 's", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's just for the research", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "to continue the research on the meeting recorder ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's extending the research ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's go higher level than we 've been talking about for meeting recorder .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the other things that we have , , been working on with , , the with communicator", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "especially with the newer things", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with the more acoustically - oriented things are are lower level .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is dealing with , , mapping on the level of , , the conversation", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "of mapping the conversations", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to different planes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so . . but , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it 's all that none of us are doing now ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or none of us are funded for ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it 's it would be new .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so assuming everybody 's completely busy now , it means we 're gonna hafta , hire more students , or , something ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "there 's evenings , and there 's weekends ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there would be there would be new hires ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and there would be expansion ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also , there 's always for everybody there 's there 's always things that are dropping off ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "grants that are ending ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or other things that are ending ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there 's there 's continual need to bring in new things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but but there definitely would be new new , , students ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , both at uw and here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are there any students in your class who are expressing interest ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not clear yet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not clear yet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "other than the one who 's already here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we got we have", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "two of them are two in the there 're two in the class already here ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then there 's third who 's doing project here ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "who , but he he won't be in the country that long ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "another will end up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually there is one other guy who 's looking that 's that", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "anyway , that 's that 's all was gonna say is that 's , that 's", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we 're sorta preceding to the next step ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , it 'll mean some more work , , , in march in getting the proposal out ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then , it 's , , we 'll see what happens .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the last one was that you had there , was about naming ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it just , we 've been cutting up sound files , in for ba both digits and for , , doing recognition .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and liz had some suggestions on naming", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it just brought up the whole issue that hasn't really been resolved about naming .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , , one thing she would like to have is for all the names to be the same length", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that sorting is easier .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "same number of characters", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that when you 're sorting filenames you can easily extract out bits and pieces that you want .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that 's easy enough to do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and don't think we have so many meetings that 's big deal just to change the names .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that means , , instead of calling it \" mr one \" , \" mr two \" , you 'd call it \" mrm zero one \" ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "\" mrm zero two \" , things like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just so that they 're they 're all the same length .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , , when you , do things like that you can always", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "as long as you have", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "you can always search from the beginning or the end of the string .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the problem is that they 're lot of fields .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so \" zero two \"", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so we have we 're gonna have the speaker id ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "information on the microphones ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", your example was really", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "information on the speak on the channels and all that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so if each one of those is fixed length , the sorting becomes lot easier .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "she wanted to keep them the same lengths across different meetings also .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so like , the nsa meeting lengths , all filenames are gonna be the same length as the meeting recorder meeting names ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and as said , the it 's we just don't have that many that 's big deal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "cuz of digits .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and so , , , at some point we have to take few days off ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let the transcribers have few days off ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "make no one 's touching the data", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and reorganize the file structures .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and when we do that we can also rationalize some of the naming .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would think though that the transcribe the transcripts themselves wouldn't need to have such lengthy names .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , , you 're dealing with different domain there , and with start and end times and all that ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and channels and ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so the only thing that would change with that is just the directory names ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , it 's different set .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "would change them to match .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so instead of being mr one it would be mrm zero one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but don't think that 's big deal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "fine . fine .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so for the meetings we were thinking about three letters and three numbers", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for meeting ds .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for speakers , or and then three numbers ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for , and , ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that also brings up the point that we have to start assembling speaker database so that we get those links back and forth", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and keep it consistent .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then , , the microphone issues .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we want some way of specifying , more than looking in the \" key \" file , what channel and what mike . what channel , what mike , and what broadcaster .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or how to say it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so with this one it 's this particular headset with this particular transmitter as wireless .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that one is different headset and different channel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so we just need some naming conventions on that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's gonna become especially important once we start changing the microphone set - up .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have some new microphones that 'd like to start trying out ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "once test them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then we 'll we 'll need to specify that somewhere .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so was just gonna do fixed list of , , microphones and types .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , as said", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that sounds good .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "since we have such short agenda list wi will ask how are the transcriptions going ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the the news is that 've", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so 've switched to", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "start my new sentence .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "switched to doing the channel - by - channel transcriptions to provide , , the , tighter time bins for partly for use in thilo 's work", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and also it 's of relevance to other people in the project .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and , , discovered in the process couple of interesting things ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "one of them is that , , it seems that there are time lags involved in doing this ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "using an interface that has so much more complexity to it .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and and wanted to ask , , chuck to help me with some of the questions of efficiency .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "was thinking the best way to do this in the long run may be to give them single channel parts", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and then piece them together later .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and have script ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "piece them together .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so it 's like , know that take them apart and put them together and 'll end up with the representation", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "which is where the real power of that interface is .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and it may be that it 's faster to transcribe channel at time with only one , , sound file and one , , set of , , utterances to check through .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "'m little confused .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that one of the reason we thought we were so much faster than , , the other transcription , , thing was that we were using the mixed file .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , , with the mixed , when you have an overlap , you only have choice of one start and end time for that entire overlap ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "which means that you 're not tightly , , tuning the

"F"}, {"text": "the fact that there was some", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "had the indication from dan ellis in the email that sent to you ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that in principle we might be

,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , , this is it 's this is actual that we wanna work with .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is in very interesting", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because it has it

communit communicative .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "they breathe all the time .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and once in while breath is communicative ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but very rarely .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so now , had discussion with chuck about the data structure", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and the idea is that the transcripts will that get stored as master", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "there 'll be master transcript", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "which has in it everything that 's needed for both of these uses .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and the one that 's used for

"speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and that would be extremely time - effective , if that 's sufficient .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "'m it 's too if it 's too hard for us to annotate the breaths per se , we are gonna be building up models for these things", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and these things are somewhat self - aligning ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if so , we if we say there is some thing
