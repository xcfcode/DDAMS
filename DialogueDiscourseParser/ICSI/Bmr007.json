{"text": "so , if you 've looked at this you 've seen it before ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , as , part of the encoding includes mark that indicates an overlap .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's not indicated with , , tight precision , it 's just indicated that , so , it 's indicated to so the people parts of sp which stretches of speech were in the clear , versus being overlapped by others .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , used this mark and , and , , divided the", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "wrote script which divides things into individual minutes , of which we ended up with forty five , and little bit .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and , , minute zero , , is the first minute up to sixty seconds .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and , what you can see is the number of overlaps and then to the , whether they involve two speakers , three speakers , or more than three speakers .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and , and , what was looking for sp specifically was the question of whether they 're distributed evenly throughout or whether they 're bursts of them .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and it looked to me as though", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "this is just , this would this is not statistically verified , but it did look to me as though there are bursts throughout , rather than being localized to particular region .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the part down there , where there 's the maximum number of , overlaps is an area where we were discussing whether or not it would be useful to indi to to code stress , , sentence stress as possible indication of , information retrieval .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so it 's like , , rather , lively discussion there .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "what was what 's the parenthesized that says , like the first one that says six overlaps and then two point eight ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's the per cent .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , six is , two point eight percent of the total number of overlaps in the session .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "at the very end , this is when people were , , packing up to go ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "there 's this final ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we don't remember where the digits fell .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "'d have to look at that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but the final three there are no overlaps .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and couple times there are not .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , it seems like it goes through bursts but , that 's it .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "now , another question is there are there individual differences in whether you 're likely to be overlapped with or to overlap with others .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and , again want to emphasize this is just one particular one particular meeting , and also there 's been no statistical testing of it all , but , took the coding of the", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": ", my had this script figure out , who was the first speaker , who was the second speaker involved in two - person overlap , didn't look at the ones involving three or more .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and , this is how it breaks down in the individual cells of who tended to be overlapping most often with who else ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and if you look at the marginal totals , which is the ones on the side and across the bottom , you get the totals for an individual .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , if you look at the bottom , those are the , numbers of overlaps in which adam was involved as the person doing the overlapping and if you look", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "'m , but you 're alphabetical , that 's why 'm choosing you", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and then if you look across the , then that 's where he was the person who was the sp first speaker in the pair and got overlap overlapped with by somebody .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and , then if you look down in the summary table , then you see that , they 're differences in whether person got overlapped with or overlapped by .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "is this just raw counts or is it", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so it would be interesting to see how much each person spoke .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "yes , very true very true", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "normalized to how much", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "it would be good to normalize with respect to that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "now on the table did take one step toward , away from the raw frequencies by putting , percentages .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so that the percentage of time of the times that person spoke , what percentage ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so . of the times person spoke and furthermore was involved in two - person overlap , what percentage of the time were they the overlapper and what percent of the time were they the overlappee ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and there , it looks like you see some differences ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that some people tend to be overlapped with more often than they 're overlapped ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but , , this is just one meeting , there 's no statistical testing involved , and that would be required for for finding of any scientific reliability .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , it would be statistically incorrect to conclude from this that adam talked too much .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no no actually , that would be actually statistically correct ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and 'm , 'm don't see point of singling people out ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "rather enjoyed it , but this", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now , this is case where", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but the numbers speak for themselves .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "he 's , .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": ", it 's like 'm not saying on the tape who did better or worse", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "yes , that 's , so you don't nee .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "because don't think that it 's", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and here 's case where , human subjects people would say be that you anonymize the results , and , so , might as do this .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "when this is what this is actually when jane sent this email first , is what caused me to start thinking about anonymizing the data .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and actually , , not about an individual , it 's the point about tendencies toward , different styles , different speaker styles .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and it would be , , there 's also the question of what type of overlap was this , and what were they ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and and and know that distinguish at least three types and , probably more ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the general cultural idea which , the conversation analysts originally started with in the seventies was that we have this strict model where politeness involves that you let the person finish before you start talking ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and , , we know that an and they 've loosened up on that too in the intervening time , that that 's that 's viewed as being culturally - relative thing ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that you have the high - involvement style from the east coast where people will overlap often as an indication of interest in what the other person is saying .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "fine , that 's alright , that 's .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and and , , in contrast , so deborah and also deborah tannen 's thesis", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "she talked about differences of these types , that they 're just different styles ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and it 's you can't impose model of there of the ideal being no overlaps ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and , conversational analysts also agree with that ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so it 's now , universally ag with .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and and , als", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "'t say universally ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but anyway , the people who used to say it was strict , now , don't .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "they also , , ack acknowledge the influence of sub of subcultural norms and cross - cultural norms and things .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , then it beco though so just superficially to give couple ideas of the types of overlaps involved , have at the bottom several that noticed .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , , there are backchannels , like what adam just did now", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and , , anticipating the end of question and simply answering it earlier ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and there are several of those in this in these data where", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because we 're people who 've talked to each other ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we the topic is , what the possibilities are and and we 've spoken with each other", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so we the other person 's style is likely to be", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and so and there are number of places where someone just answered early .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and places also which were interesting , where two or more people gave exactly the same answer in unison different words", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but , the , everyone 's saying \" yes \" or , or ev even more sp specific than that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , , that , overlap 's not necessarily bad thing and that it would be im useful to subdivide these further and see if there are individual differences in styles with respect to the types involved .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and that 's all wanted to say on that , unless people have questions .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the biggest , result here , which is one we 've we 've talked about many times and isn't new to us , but which would be interesting to show someone who isn't familiar with this is just the sheer number of overlaps .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that that ? that ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , yes !", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "here 's relatively short meeting ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's forty plus minute meeting ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and not only were there two hundred and fifteen overlaps but , there 's one minute there where there where there wasn't any overlap ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "hundred ninety - seven .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "it 's throughout this thing ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 'd be interesting", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's you have", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "at the bottom , you have the bottom three .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so four minutes all together with none .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so the bottom three did have going on ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there was speech ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , - .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but just no overlaps .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so if the this", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 'd be interesting to see what the total amount of time is in the overlaps , versus", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , exactly and that 's that 's where jose 's pro project comes in .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": ", have this that infor have that information now .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "was about to ask", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "about how much is it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the the duration of of each of the overlaps .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "what 's what 's the average length ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "haven't averaged it now", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but , will , will do the study of the with the with the program with the , the different , the , nnn , distribution of the duration of the overlaps .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you don you don't have feeling for roughly how much it is ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "mmm , because the , @ @ is @ @ .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the duration is , the variation of the duration is , very big on the dat", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "suspect that it will also differ , depending on the type of overlap involved .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so backchannels will be very brief", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because , on your surface bit of zone of overlapping with the duration , overlapped and another very short .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "probably it 's very difficult to because the overlap is , on is only the in the final \" \" of the of the fin the end the end word of the , previous speaker with the next word of the new speaker .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "considered that 's an overlap but it 's very short , it 's an \" \" with and the idea is probably , when , we studied that zone , , we we have confusion with noise .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "with that fricative sounds , but have new information but have to study .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you split this by minute , so if an overlap straddles the boundary between two minutes , that counts towards both of those minutes .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "actually , actually not .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so le let 's think about the case where starts speaking and then overlaps with , and then the minute boundary happens .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and let 's say that after that minute boundary , is still speaking , and overlaps with ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that would be new overlap .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but otherwise , let 's say comes to the conclusion of that turn without anyone overlapping with him or her ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "in which case there would be no overlap counted in that second minute .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "no , but suppose they both talk simultaneously both portion of it is in minute one and another portion of minute two .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "in that case , my the coding that was using since we haven't , incorporated adam 's , coding of overlap yets , the coding of", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "\" yets \" is not word .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "since we haven't incorporated adam 's method of handling overl overlaps yet then that would have fallen through the cra cracks .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it would be an underestimate of the number of overlaps because , wou wouldn't be able to pick it up from the way it was encoded so far .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we just haven't done the precise second to sec , second to second coding of when they occur .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "'m 'm confused now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so let me restate what andreas was saying and see .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let 's say that in second fifty - seven of one minute , you start talking and start talking and we ignore each other and keep on talking for six seconds .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we go over so we were we were talking over one another , and it 's just in each case , it 's just one interval .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , we talked over the minute boundary .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is this considered as one overlap in each of the minutes , the way you have done this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , it wouldn't .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it would be considered as an overlap in the first one .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so that 's good , , in the sense that andreas meant the question ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's that 's good , , cuz the overall rate is", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they 're not double counted .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "other - otherwise you 'd get double counts , here and there .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and then it would be harder", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "should also say did simplifying , count in that if was speaking overlapped with and then came back again and overlapped with again ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "didn't count that as three - person overlap , counted that as two - person overlap , and it was being overlapped with by .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because the idea was the first speaker had the floor and the second person started speaking and then the the first person reasserted the floor thing .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "these are simplifying assumptions ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "didn't happen very often ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "there may be like three overlaps affected that way in the whole thing .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "want to go back and listen to minute forty - one .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "cuz find it interesting that there were large number of overlaps and they were all two - speaker .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "what what would have thought in is that when there were large number of overlaps , it was because everyone was talking at once , but not .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "that 's interesting .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that 's interesting .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that 's really neat .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "there 's lot of backchannel , lot lot of", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "this is really interesting data .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "what 's really interesting though , it is before saying \" yes , meetings have lot of overlaps \" is to actually find out how many more we have than two - party .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "cuz in two - party conversations , like switchboard , there 's an awful lot too if you just look at backchannels , if you consider those overlaps ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's also ver it 's huge .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's just that people haven't been looking at that because they 've been doing single - channel processing for speech recognition .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , the question is , , how many more overlaps do you have of , say the two - person type , by adding more people . to meeting ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it may be lot more but it may it may not be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but see , find it interesting even if it wasn't any more ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because since we were dealing with this full duplex thing in switchboard where it was just all separated out we just everything was just ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that so the issue is in situation where that 's", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's not really \" \" .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it depends what you 're doing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if you were actually having ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "depends what you 're doing ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if now we 're do we have individual mikes on the people in this meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the question is , \" are there really more overlaps happening than there would be in two - person party \" .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and and there may be , but", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let let let me rephrase what 'm saying cuz don't 'm getting it across .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what what what shouldn't use words like \" \" because that 's too too imprecise .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but what is that , in switchboard , despite the many other problems that we have , one problem that we 're not considering is overlap .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and what we 're doing now is , aside from the many other differences in the task , we are considering overlap", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and one of the reasons that we 're considering it , , one of them not all of them , one of them is that at least , 'm very interested in the scenario in which , both people talking are equally audible , and from single microphone .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so , in that case , it does get mixed in , and it 's pretty hard to jus to just ignore it , to just do processing on one and not on the other .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "agree that it 's an issue here but it 's also an issue for switchboard", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if you think of meetings being recorded over the telephone , which , , this whole point of studying meetings isn't just to have people in room but to also have meetings over different phone lines .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "far field mike people wouldn't be interested in that but all the dialogue issues still apply ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if each of us was calling and having meeting that way you kn like conference call .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , just the question is , , in switchboard you would think that 's the simplest case of meeting of more than one person ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and 'm wondering how much more overlap of the types that jane described happen with more people present .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it may be that having three people is very different from having two people or it may not be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's an important question to ask .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what 'm all 'm really saying is that don't think we were considering that in switchboard .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not you , me .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "though it wasn't in the design .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "were you were you were you measuring it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "actually to tell you the truth , the reason why it 's hard to measure is because of", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , from the point of view of studying dialogue , , which dan jurafsky and andreas and had some projects on , you want to know the sequence of turns .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what happens is if you 're talking and have backchannel in the middle of your turn , and then you keep going what it looks like in dialogue model is your turn and then my backchannel ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "even though my backchannel occurred completely inside your turn .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , for things like language modeling or dialogue modeling it 's we know that 's wrong in real time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , because of the acoustic segmentations that were done and the fact that some of the acoustic data in switchboard were missing , people couldn't study it ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that doesn't mean in the real world that people don't talk that way .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , it 's", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wasn't saying that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was just saying that now we 're looking at it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and and , you wanted to look at it before but , for these various technical reasons in terms of how the data was you weren't .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we 're looking at it here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that 's why it 's coming to us as new", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "even though it may be , if your if your hypothes the hypothesis you were offering", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "? if it 's the null poth hypothesis , and if actually you have as much overlap in two - person , we the answer to that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the reason we the answer to is cuz it wasn't studied and it wasn't studied because it wasn't set up . ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "all is that if you 're asking the question from the point of view of what 's different about meeting , studying meetings of , say , more than two people versus what kinds of questions you could ask with two - person meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's important to distinguish that , , this project is getting lot of overlap but other projects were too , but we just couldn't study them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "may have been .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "may have been .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there is high rate ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we do kn we the numbers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's but how high ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "here have question .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would be interesting to know .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "see , , le let me", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "my point was just if you wanted to say to somebody , \" what have we learned about overlaps here ? \"", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just never mind comparison with something else ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what we 've learned about is overlaps in this situation , is that the first the first - order thing would say is that there 's lot of them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in in the sense that if you said if", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't di agree with that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in way , what 'm comparing to is more the common sense notion of how much people overlap .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the fact that when when , , adam was looking for stretch of speech before , that didn't have any overlaps , and he he was having such hard time", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and now look at this and go , \" , see why he was having such hard time \" .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's also true of switchboard .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's happening lot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it may not be", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wasn't saying it wasn't .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it 's just ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was commenting about this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "all 'm saying is that from the", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'m saying if have this complicated thing in front of me , and we sh which , we 're gonna get much more sophisticated about when we get lots more data ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but then , if was gonna describe to somebody what did you learn here , about , , the modest amount of data that was analyzed 'd say , \" , the first - order thing was there was lot of overlaps \" .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it 's not just an overlap bunch of overlaps second - order thing is it

{"text": "the problem is he does it in two passes ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "the first pass is to find candidate places to do break .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and he does that using neural net

{"text": "so , at any rate , my next attempt , which 'm in the midst of and haven't quite finished yet was actually using the , thresholding as the way of generating the candidates .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "because one of the things that definitely happens is if you put the threshold low you get lots of breaks .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "all of which are definitely acoustic events .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "they 're definitely someone talking .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "but , like , it could be someone who isn't the person here , but the person over there or it can be the person breathing .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and then feeding that into the acoustic change detector .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and so that might work .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "but , haven't gotten very far on that .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "but all of this is close - talking mike ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "it 's , just trying to get some ground truth .", "speaker": "H"},
