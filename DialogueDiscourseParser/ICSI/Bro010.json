, nobody 's told me anything .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this was the , , talk where they were supposed to try to decide", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to to decide what to do ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , that would have been good thing to find out before this meeting ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , have no have no idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let 's let 's assume for now that we 're just plugging on ahead ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because even if they tell us that , , the rules are different , , we 're still interested in doing what we 're doing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what are you doing ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", we 've little bit worked on trying to see , , what were the bugs and the problem with the latencies .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we took first we took the lda filters", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , , we designed new filters ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "using recursive filters actually .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so when you say \" we \" , is that something sunil is doing", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or is that ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "who is doing that ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we took the filters the fir filters and we designed , , iir filters that have the same frequency response .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "similar , but that have shorter delays .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so they had two filters ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one for the low frequency bands", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and another for the high frequency bands .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so we redesigned two filters .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the low frequency band has sixty - four milliseconds of delay ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the high frequency band filter has something like eleven milliseconds compared to the two hundred milliseconds of the iir filters .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it 's not yet test .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we have the filters", "speaker": "B"},

should talk with him .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , , because the the whole problem that happened before was coordination ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so so you need to discuss with him what we 're doing ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "cuz they could be doing the same thing and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if that 's what they were trying to", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they were trying to do something different like taking , , using filter that takes only past", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is just little bit different .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but will send him an email and tell him exactly what we are doing ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we just we just have to be in contact more .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that the fact that we did that with had that thing with the

{"text": "and so , ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this will be another filter which would add ten milliseconds again .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then there 's third thing ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that , , the way on - line normalization was done , is just using this recursion on the , on the feature stream ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and but this is filter ,", "speaker": "B"},

five milliseconds in the future .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's little bit of problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , , when we add up everything it 's it will be alright .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we would be at six", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , sixty - five , plus ten , plus for the downsampling ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "plus eighty - five for the on - line

forty", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just just barely in there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "plus the frames ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it 's .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what 's the

trading latency for performance .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they were dealing with noise explicitly and we weren't ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so of it as complementary ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that if we can put the", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "think of it as what ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , , everything that we did in way it was it was just adamantly insisting on

the way we should do it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then we do it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then someone else does something that 's straight forward .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , this was test that largely had additive noise", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we did we adde did nothing explicitly to handle ad additive noise .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we just , , , trained up systems to be more discriminant .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , , we did this , , rasta - like filtering", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which was done in the log domain", "speaker": "C"},

the silence detector .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and 't remember now off the top of my head how many frames of silence we had to detect before we would declare it to be the end of an utterance .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it was ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would say it was probably around the order of two hundred and fifty milliseconds .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that 's when

that point .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no it was pretty quick .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you so you had", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you had quarter second delay before , , plus some little processing time ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then the microscope would start moving .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and there 's physical inertia there ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so probably the motion itself was all", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it felt to , , the users that it was instantaneous .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as fast as talking to person .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it don't think anybody ever complained about the delay .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you would think as long as it 's under half second .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'m not an expert on that", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't remember the exact numbers", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it was something like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't think you can really tell .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "person don't think person can tell the difference between , , , quarter of second and hundred milliseconds ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'m not even if we can tell the difference

put in delay .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it may feel different than talking to person", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because when we talk to each other we tend to step on each other 's utterances .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so like if 'm asking you question , you may start answering before 'm even done .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it would probably feel different", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but don't would feel slow .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could cut we else , we could cut down on the neural net time", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "by , , playing around little bit ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "going more into the past ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we we talked about that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so is the latency from the neural net caused by how far ahead you 're looking ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and there 's also", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 's the neural net and there 's also this , , multi - frame , , klt .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was it in the , , recurrent neural nets where they weren't looking ahead ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they weren't looking ahead much .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they they looked ahead little bit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you could do this with recurrent net .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you also could just , ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we haven't experimented with this", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but imagine you could , , , predict , , label , , from more in the past than in than in the future .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we 've we 've done some with that before .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we 've always had usually we used the symmetric windows", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we 've but we played little bit with asymmetric , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can do it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , that 's what that 's what you 're busy with ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "messing around with this ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also we were thinking to , , apply the , spectral subtraction from ericsson", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and to change the contextual klt for lda .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "change the what ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the contextual klt .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'m missing that last word .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to change and use lda discriminative .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what is the advantage of that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's that by the for the moment we have , , something that 's discriminant and nonlinear .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the other is linear but it 's not discriminant .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's linear transformation , that", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so at least just to understand what the difference was between how much you were getting from just putting the frames together and how much you 're getting from the discriminative ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what the nonlinearity does for you or doesn't do for you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just to understand it little better .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "actually what we want to do , perhaps it 's to replace to have something that 's discriminant but linear , also .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and to see if it if it improves ov over the non - discriminant linear transformation .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if the neural net is better than this", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", that 's what , is to see whether it having the neural net really buys you anything .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", it doe did look like it buys you something over just the klt .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it 's just the discrimination", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , the nonlinear discrimination isn't necessary .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "good good to know .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the other part you were saying was the spectral subtraction ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you just ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "at what stage do you do that ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you 're doing that ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it would be on the", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "on the mel frequency bands ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "be before everything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so just do that on the mel", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we we was thinking to do before after vad", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we exactly when it 's better .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so so that that the way that they 're", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one thing that would be no good to find out about from this conference call is that what they were talking about , what they 're proposing doing , was having third party , , run good vad , and determine boundaries .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then given those boundaries , then have everybody do the recognition .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "begin to work .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the reason for that was that , , if some one one group put in the vad and another didn't ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or one had better vad than the other", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "since that they 're not viewing that as being part of the task ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that any manufacturer would put bunch of effort into having some good speech - silence detection .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it still wouldn't be perfect", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the argument was \" let 's not have that be part of this test . \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "\" let 's let 's separate that out . \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they argued about that yesterday", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we should find out .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'m we 'll find out soon", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what they , what they decided .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so there 's the question of the vad", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but otherwise it 's it 's on the , the mel fil filter bank , , energies ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you do doing the ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you 're you 're subtracting in the in the it 's power domain ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or magnitude domain .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "probably power domain , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's power domain , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't remember exactly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it 's before everything else ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you look at the theory , it 's it should be in the power domain", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , , 've seen implementations where people do it in the magnitude domain", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have asked people why", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they shrug their shoulders and say , \" , it works . \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and there 's this", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 's this mysterious", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "people who do this lot have developed little tricks of the trade .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 's there 's this ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you don't just subtract the estimate of the noise spectrum .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you subtract that times", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or or less ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and generated this ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you have the estimation of the power spectra of the noise ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you multiply this by factor which is depend dependent on the snr .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "when the speech lev when the signal level is more important , compared to this noise level , the coefficient is small , and around one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but when the power le the signal level is small compared to the noise level , the coefficient is more important .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and this reduce actually the music musical noise ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is more important during silence portions ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "when the the energy 's small .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so there are tricks like this", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , mmm .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is the estimate of the noise spectrum running estimate ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's , that 's what differs from different tasks and different , spectral subtraction methods .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you have , , fair assurance that , , the noise is quite stationary , then the smartest thing to do is use as much data as possible to estimate the noise ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "get much better estimate , and subtract it off .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if it 's varying , which is gonna be the case for almost any real situation , you have to do it on - line , , with some forgetting factor .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so do you is there some long window that extends into the past over which you calculate the average ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there 's lot of different ways of computing the noise spectrum .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so one of the things that , , hans - guenter hirsch did , and pas and other people", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "actually , he 's he wasn't the only one ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was to , , take some period of of speech and in each band , , develop histogram .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , to get decent histogram of these energies takes at least few seconds really .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , you can do it with smaller amount", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it 's pretty rough .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , , the nist standard method of determining signal - to - noise ratio is based on this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , no ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's based on this method ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this histogram method .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you have histogram .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now , if you have signal and you have noise , you have these two bumps in the histogram ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which you could approximate as two gaussians .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but wh don't they overlap sometimes ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you have mixture of two gaussians .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you can use to figure out what it is . .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so so now you have this mixture of two gaussians ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you they are ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you estimate what they are ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this gives you what the signal is and what the noise energy is in that band in the spectrum .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then you look over the whole thing", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and now you have noise spectrum .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , , hans - guenter hirsch and others have used that method .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the other thing to do is which is more trivial and obvious is to , , determine through magical means that , , there 's no speech in some period ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then see what the spectrum is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's that 's tricky to do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it has mistakes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if you 've got enough time , , this other method appears to be somewhat more reliable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "variant on that for just determining signal - to - noise ratio is to just , you can do an iterative thing , - like thing , to determine means only .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it is still ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but just determine the means only .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't worry about the variances .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then you just use those mean values as being the , signal - to - noise ratio in that band .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but what is the", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it seems like this thing could add to the latency .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "depending on where the window was that you used to calculate the signal - to - noise ratio .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "cuz if you don't look into the future ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that that was my question ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "at the beginning you have some", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's an interesting question .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wonder how they did do it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "actually , it 's mmm if - if you want to have good estimation on non - stationary noise you have to look in the in the future .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you take your window and build your histogram in this window , , what you can expect is to have an estimation of of the noise in the middle of the window ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not at the end .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but what does what does alcatel do ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and and france telecom .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they just look in the past .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it works because the noise are , pret , almost stationary", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", you 're talking about non - stationary noise", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that spectral subtraction is rarely is not gonna work really for non - stationary noise ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if if you have good estimation of the noise ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it has to work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it 's hard to", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that 's hard to do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's hard to do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so so that what is wh what 's more common is that you 're going to be helped with slowly varying or stationary noise .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's what spectral subtraction will help with , practically speaking .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it varies lot , to get if if to get good estimate you need few seconds of speech ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "even if it 's centered ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you need few seconds to get decent estimate but it 's changed lot in few seconds , then it , , it 's problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "imagine five hertz is the middle of the of the speech modulation spectrum ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so imagine jack hammer going at five hertz .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so in this case , , , you cannot", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , hirsch does experiment with windows of like between five hundred milliseconds and one second .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "five hundred wa was not so bad .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and he worked on non - stationary noises ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like noise modulated with , wi with amplitude modulations", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "things like that ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "were his , , windows centered around the", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in the paper he showed that actually the estimation of the noise is delayed .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's there is", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have to center the window ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , understand it 's better to do", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but think that , , for real noises wh what 's most likely to happen is that there 'll be some things that are relatively stationary", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "where you can use one or another spectral subtraction thing", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and other things where it 's not so stationary", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can always pick something that falls between your methods ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if , , if sinusoidally , , modul amplitude modulated noise is big problem in practice .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we could probably get really good estimate of the noise if we just went to the noise files ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and built the averages from them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what do you mean ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you 're saying , cheat .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if the if the noise
