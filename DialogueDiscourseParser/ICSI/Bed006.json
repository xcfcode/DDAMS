re - phrase the task that we gave them ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so we had meeting on friday talking about how to avoid that ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it proved finally fruitful in the sense that we came up with new scenario for how to get the subject to really have intentions", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and to act upon those ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there the idea is now that next actually we need to hire one more person to actually do that job", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because it 's getting more complicated .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if anyone interested in what 'm about to describe , tell that person to write mail to me or jerry soon ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the idea now is to come up with high level of abstract tasks", "speaker": "C"}, {"text":

category in emptying your roll of film , the person can then decide \" , wanna do that at this place \" ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "make up their own itinerary and tasks", "speaker": "C"}, {"text":

\" wanted to take picture of that \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and \" eat here \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then goes in and solves the task with the system ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we 're gonna try out that", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you 'll have those say somewhere what their intention was", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so you still have the thing about having data where what the actual intention was ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "there 's nothing that says \" these are the things you want to do \"", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so they 'll say \" these are the things want to do \"", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so they 'll have little bit more natural interaction ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so they 'll be given this map , which means that they won't have to like ask the system for in for like high level information about where things are ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's schematic tourist map .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it 'll be it 'll still require the that information", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it it doesn't have like streets on it that would allow them to figure out their way", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "not not really the street network .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you 're just saying like what part of town the things are in or whatever ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the map is more means for them to have the buildings and their names", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and some ma major streets and their names", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we want to ask them , if you have get it isolated street", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the , whatever ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "\" river street \" ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they know that they have decided that , yes , that 's where they want to do this action that they have it with them and they can actually read them", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or have the label for the object", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because it 's too hard to memorize all these st strange german names .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then we 're going to have another we 're gonna have another trial run", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ie the first with that new setup tomorrow at two", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we have real interesting subject which is ron", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for who those who know him , he 's the founder of ici .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so he 'll he 's around seven seventy years old , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "didn't know he was the founder .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and he also approached me and he offered to help our project", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and he was more thinking about some high level thinking tasks", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and said \" we need help", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can come in as subject \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and he said \" \" .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that 's what 's gonna happen , tomorrow ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "using this new plan ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "new new set up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which 'll hopefully scrape together", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , to fey , we already have blueprint and work with that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "comments on that ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if not , we can move on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no more questions ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'m not understand this", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so what 's the this is what you made , fey ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "'m not understand everything that 's being talked about", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "like so so it 's just based on like the materials you had about heidelberg .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "are you familiar with the with the very rough setup of the data ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but imagine 'll just catch on .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "based on the web site ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there 's web site", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and then you could like figure out what the cate", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's tourist information web site ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is where they 're supposed to", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "talk to machine and it breaks down and then the human comes on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the question is just how do we get the tasks in their head that they have an intention of doing something and have need to ask the system without giving them clear wording or phrasing of the task .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because what will happen then is that people repeat , or as much as they can , of that phrasing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "are you worried about being able to identify", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "the goals that we 've you have been talking about are this these identifying which of three modes their question concerns .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so it 's like the enter versus view", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we we will get protocol of the prior interaction ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's where the instructor , the person we are going to hire , and the subjects sit down together with these high level things", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the first question for the subject is , \" so these are things , , we thought tourist can do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is there anything that interests you ? \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the person can say \" , sh", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is something would do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would go shopping \" .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then we can this instructor can say \" , then you may want to find out how to get over here", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because this is where the shopping district is \" .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the interaction beforehand will give them hints about how specific or how whatever though the kinds of questions that are going to ask during the actual session ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "just , what what would you like to buy", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then there you wanna buy whatever cuckoos clocks", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the there is store there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the task then for that person is finding out how to get there ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's what 's left .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we know that the intention is to enter because we know that the person wants to buy cuckoos clock .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so like those tasks are all gonna be unambiguous about which of the three modes .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so the idea is to try to get the actual phrasing that they might use and try to interfere as little as possible with their choice of words .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that they 'll be here ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "yes . in sense that 's exactly the the idea ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which is never possible in in in lab situation ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the one experiment that that 've read somewhere , it was they used pictures .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so to actually specify the tasks .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we had exactly that on our list of possible way things", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we even made silly thing how that could work , how you control you are here", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you want to know how to get someplace ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and this is the place", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it 's museum", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you want to do some", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and and there 's person looking at pictures .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , , this is exactly getting someplace with the intention of entering and looking at pictures .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "however , not only was the common census were among all participants of friday 's meeting was it 's gonna be very laborious to make these drawings for each different things ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "all the different actions , if possible ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also people will get caught up in the pictures .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so all of sudden we 'll get descriptions of pictures in there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and people talking about pictures and pictorial representations", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would would still be willing to try it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'m 'm not saying it 's necessary", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you might be able to combine text and some picture", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and also it will be good idea to show them the text and chew the task", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then take the test away the the text away", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that they are not guided by what you wrote ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but can come up with their with their own", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they will have no more linguistic matter in front of them when they enter this room .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then suggest we move on to the to", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have the edu project ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let me make one more general remark , has two side actions , its action items that we 're do dealing with ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one is modifying the smartkom parser and the other one is modifying the smartkom natural language generation module .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and this is not too complicated", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but 'm just mentioning it", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "put it in the framework", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because this is something we will talk about now .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have some news from the generation ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you have news from the parser ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , , would really it would be better if talked about it on friday .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "if that 's .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "did you run into problems or did you run into not having time ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but not any time part .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so that 's good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's better than running into problems .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and do have some good news for the natural language generation however .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the good news is it 's done .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "meaning that tilman becker , who does the german one , actually took out some time and already did it in english for us .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so the version he 's sending us is already producing the english that 's needed to get by in version one point one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so take it that was similar to the what we did for the parsing ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it even though the generator is little bit more complex", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it would have been , not changing one hundred words but four hundred words ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it would have been", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but this is good news ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the the time", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do have it here ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the time is now fixed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's the last week of april until the fourth of may", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it 's twenty - sixth through fourth . that they 'll be here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it 's it 's extremely important that the two of you are also present in this town during that time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what are the days ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "april twenty - sixth to the may fourth ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "something like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'ll probably be here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you will be here .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "isn't finals coming up then after that ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "finals was that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it doesn't really have much meaning to grad students", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but final projects might .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "actually , that 's true .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "anyway , so this is", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'ll be here working on something .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's just will be here , , in", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'ll be here too actually", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no it 's just they 're coming for us so that we can bug them", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and ask them more questions", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and sit down together", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and write sensible code", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they can give some talks and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it 's not like we need to be with them twenty - four hours day for the seven days that they 're here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not not unless you really want to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they 're very dependent", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "not unless you really want to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they 're both", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you may want to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that much from the parser and generator side ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "unless there are more questions on that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , no sample generator output yet ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it just mail that , , he 's sending me the the soon", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is being sent ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and was completely flabbergasted here", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and and that 's also it 's it 's going to produce the concept - to - speech blah - blah information for necessary for one point one in english", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "based on the english ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was like \" ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we 're done .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we 're done ! \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that was like one of the first , the first task was getting it working for english .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so that 's over now .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so the basic requirement fulfilled .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "the basic requirement is fulfilled almost .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when andreas stolcke and his gang ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when they have changed the language model of the recognizer and the dictionary ,

"speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if something actually happens and some answers come out , then we 're done .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if and they 're correct .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so it 's not done .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and they are correct .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "perhaps if the answers have something to do with the questions .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's not just like anything .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and they 're mostly in english .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "are they is it using the database ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "the german tv movie .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so all the actual data might be german names ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "or are they all like american tv programs ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "want to see \" die dukes von hazard \"", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so you how the german dialogue the german the demo dialogue actually works .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the first thing is what 's , , showing on tv ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then the person is presented with what 's running on tv", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in germany on that day , on that evening", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so you take one look at it and then you say \" that 's really nothing there 's nothing for me there \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "\" what 's running in the cinemas ? \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so there 's something better happening there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then you get you 're shown what movies play which films ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it 's gonna be all the heidelberg movies and what films they are actually showing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and most of them are going to be hollywood movies .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , \" american beauty \" is \" american beauty \" ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but they 're shown like on screen .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's so would the generator ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "like the english language sentence of it is \" these are the follow the following films are being shown \" like that ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but it in that sense it doesn't make in that case it doesn't really make sense to read them out loud .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you 're displaying them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it 'll just display", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but it 'll tell you that this is what 's showing in heidelberg and there you go .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we don't have to worry about", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and the presentation agent will go \" hhh ! \" nuh ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like that the avatar .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then you pick movie and and it show shows you the times", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you pick time", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you pick seats and all of this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it 's so this time we are at an advantage", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because it was problem for the

.", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "then on to the modeling .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there it is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what 's the next thing ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "this is very

{"text": "not an example like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is not an xml", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is towards an schema ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the idea is , so , imagine we

"C"}, {"text": "forced motion and caused action ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "also , these things may or may not get their own structure in the future .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is something that , , may also be res as result of your work", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in the future , we may find out that , , there 're really these subtle differences between", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "even within the domain of entering in the light of source - path - goal schema , that we need to put in fill in additional structure up there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it gives us handle .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so with this we can slaughter the cow any anyway we want .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it it is it was it gave us some headache ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how do we avoid writing down that we have the enter source - path - goal", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that this but this gets the job done in that respect", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it is even conceptually somewhat adequate in sense that we 're talking about two different things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we 're talking more on the intention level , up there ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and more on the this is the your basic bone schema , down there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one question , robert .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "when you point at the screen is it your shadow that 'm supposed to look at ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's the shadow .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "whereas keep looking where your hand is ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that wouldn't have helped you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what this is that there 's an interface between what we are doing and the action planner", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and now the way the interface is \" action go \" and then they have the what the person claimed was the source and the person claimed as the goal passed on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the problem is , is that the current system does not distinguish between goes of type \" going into \" , goes of type \" want to go to place where take picture of \" , et cetera .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is what it looks like", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now , some simple \" go \" action from it from an object named \" peter 's kirche \" of the type \" church \" to an object named \" powder - tower \" of the type \" tower \" .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is the what the action planner uses ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and is that and tha that 's changeable ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "like are we adapting to it ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we this is the output , , of the natural language understanding ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the input into the action planning , as it is now .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and what we are going to do ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you can see here ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for johno focus the shadow ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "here you have the action and the domain object", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what did you think he was doing ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "laser pointer would be most appropriate here .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "robert likes to be abstract", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that 's what thought he was doing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you look up here .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "between here and here ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so as you can see this is on one level and we are going to add another \" struct \" , if you want , ie rich action description on that level .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so in the future", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it 's just an additional information", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "in the future though , the content of hypothesis will not only be an object and an action and domain object but an action , domain object , and rich action description ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that doesn't hurt the current way .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "which which we 're abbreviating as \" rad \" .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you had like an action schema and source - path - goal schema ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so how does this source - path - goal schema fit into the action schema ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "like is it one of the tags there ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "can you go back to that one ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so the source - path - goal schema in this case ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'ve if understand how we described we set this up ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "cuz we 've been arguing about it all week ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we 'll hold the", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in this case it will hold the the features .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'m not it 's hard for me to exactly", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that will store the object that is", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the source will store the object that we 're going from ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the goal will store the", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the fillers of the role source .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we 'll fill those in fill those roles in ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the action - schemas have extra", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "see we so those are schemas exist", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because in case we need extra information", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "instead of just making it an attribute and which is just one thing we decided to make it 's own entity so that we could explode it out later on in case there is some structure that we need to exploit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is just xml mo notational", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but the fact that it 's action schema and then slash action schema", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 's whole entit", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 's block ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's block ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "whereas source is just an attribute ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "source is just not spelled out here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "source meaning source will be will have name , type , dimensionality ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "- , - .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "could it could also be blocked out then as", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "source it will be ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we know lot about sources", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we 'll put all of that in source .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it 's independent whether we are using the spg schema in an enter , view , or approach mode ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is just properties of the spg schema .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can talk about paths being the fastest , the quickest , the nicest and ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or and the trajector should be coming in there as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then the same about goals .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the question is when you actually fill one of these out , it 'll be under action schema ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's gonna be one you 'll pick one of those for", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "these are this is just layout of the possible that could go play that role .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so the the roles will be filled in with the schema", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then what actual action is chosen is will be in the in the action schema section .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so one question .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "this was in this case it 's all clear , obvious ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but you can think of the enter , view and approach as each having their roles ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "the it 's it 's implicit that the person that 's moving is doing entering viewing and approaching ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but the usual thing is we have bindings between", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "they 're like action specific roles and the more general source - path - goal specific roles .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so are we worrying about that or not for now ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "yes , yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "since you bring it up now , we will worry about it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "tell us more about it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what do you what do you", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what 's that ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "may be just reading this and interpreting it into my head in the way that 've always viewed things", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and that may or may not be what you intended .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but if it is , then the top block is like", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": ", you have to list exactly what - schema", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "or in this action schema ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "there 'll be certain one , that has its own structure", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and it has about that specific to entering or viewing or approaching ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but those could include roles like the thing that you 're viewing , the thing that you 're entering , the thing that you 're", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so very specific role names are \" viewed thing \" , \" entered thing \"", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "think of enter , view and approach as frames", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and they have frame - specific parameters and roles", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and you can also describe them in general way as source - path - goal schema", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and there 's other image schemas that you could add after this that , how do they work in terms of force dynamics", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "- , - .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or how do they work in terms of other things .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so all of those have either specific frame specific roles or more general frame specific roles that might have binding .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so the question is are how to represent when things are linked in certain way .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so we know for enter that there 's container potentially involved", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and it 's not", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "if you wanna have in the same level as the action schema spg schema", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's somewhere in there that you need to represent that there is some container", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and the interior of it corresponds to some part of the source - path - goal goal goal in this case .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so is there an easy way in this notation to show when there 's identity between things", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and di if that 's something we need to invent", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "wa wasn't there supposed to be link in the", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if this answers your question ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was just staring at this while you were talking ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "link between the action schema , field in the in the schema for the image schemas that would link us to which action schema we were supposed to use", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's that 's one thing is that we can link up ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "think also that we can have one or as many as we want links from the schema up to the action description of it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the notion got from nancy 's idea was that we may find concepts floating around in the action description of the action \" enter \" frame up there that are , when you talk about the real world , actually identical to the goal of the source - path - goal schema ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and do we have means of telling it within that", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the answer is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the way we have those means that are even part of the - three - api ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "meaning we can reference .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's exactly what is necessary .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "this referencing thing however is of temporary nature", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because sooner or later the - three - will be finished with their - path , , , specification", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then it 's going to be even much nicer .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then we have real means of pointing at an individual instantiation of one of our elements here", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and link it to another one , and this not only within document but also via documents ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and all in very easy homogenous framework .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so happen to know how what \" sooner or later \" means like in practice ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but it 's soon .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it 's it 's the spec is there", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it 's gonna part of the - three - ap api filed by the end of this year", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that this means we can start using it now .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but this is technical detail .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so pointer way to really say pointers .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "references from the roles in the schema the bottom schemas to the action schemas is wha 'm assuming .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "personally , 'm looking even more forward to the day when we 're going to have forms , which is form of notation where it allows you to say that if the spg action up there is enter , then the goal type can never be statue .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you have constraints that are dependent on the actual specific filler , , of some attribute .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "this , , does not make sense in light of the statue of liberty ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "however it is these things are imaginable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , like are you gonna have similar schemas for fm", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "or the gateway arch in st .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "like forced motion and caused action and", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "like you have for spg ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and if so like can are you able to enforce that if it 's if it 's spg action then you have that schema ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "if it 's forced motion then you have the other schema present in the", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we have no means of enforcing that ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it would be considered valid if we have an spg action \" enter \" and no spg schema , but forced action schema .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "whi - which is not bad ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "because , that there 's multiple sens", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that particular case , there 's mult there 's forced side of that verb as .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it it means we had nothing to say about the source - path - goal .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what 's also , and for for me in my mind", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's it 's crucially necessary , is that we can have multiple schemas and multiple action schemas in parallel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we started thinking about going through our bakery questions ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so when say \" is there bakery here ? \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do ultimately want our module to be able to first of all tell the rest of the system \" this person actually wants to go there \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and \" \" , that person actually wants to buy something to eat there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if these are two different schemas ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ie the source - path - goal schema of getting there and then the buying snacks schema ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would they both be listed here in", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "under so under action schema there 's list that can include both things .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "ye , they would both schemas would appear ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what is the", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is there \" buying snacks \" schema ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's interesting .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "what is the have", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the buying snack schema ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "buying buying his food", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'m there 's commercial event schema in there somewhere .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "\" commercial event \" .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so so we would we would instantiate the spg schema with source - path - goal blah - blah", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the buying event at which however that looks like , the place thing to buy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would you say that the like", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "you could have flat structure and just say these are two independent things ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but there 's also this like causal ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so one is really facilitating the other and it 's part of compound action of some kind , which has structure .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "now it 's technically possible that you can fit schema within schema ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and schema within schemata", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's nicer for lot of reasons", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but might be pain", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "for me it seems that", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are truly times when you have two independent goals that they might express at once ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but in this case it 's really like there 's purpo means that for achieving some other purpose .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "if 'm if 'm recipient of such message", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and get source - path - goal where the goal is bakery", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then get commercial action which takes place in bakery ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and and they are , via identifiers , identified to be the same thing here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "see that bothers me that they 're the same thing .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "no , no , just the", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because they 're two different things", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "one of which is", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "you could think of one sub pru whatever pre - condition for the second .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so there 's like levels of granularity .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so there 's there 's single event of which they are both part .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and they 're independently they are events which have very different characters as far as source - path - goal whatever .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so when you identify source - path - goal and whatever , there 's gonna to be desire , whatever , eating , hunger ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "whatever other frames you have involved , they have to match up in ways .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so it seems like each of them has its own internal structure and mapping to these schemas", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but that 's just that 's just me .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we 're gonna hit lot of interesting problems", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and as prefaced it this is the result of one week of arguing about it", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "still am not entirely that really fully grasp the syntax of this .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's not it 's not actually very actually , it doesn't actually", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it occur it occurs to me that ne", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or the intended interpretation of this .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "should have we should have added an ano an xml example ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or some xml examples", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that would be that would be .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and this is on on my list of things until next week .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's also question of the recursiveness and hier hierarchy in there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do we want the schemas just blump ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's if we can actually get it so that we can , out of one utterance , activate more than one schema , , then we 're already pretty good ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have to be careful with that thing", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because many actions presuppose some almost infinitely many other actions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if you go to bakery you have general intention of not being hungry .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have specific intentions to cross the traffic light to get there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have further specific intentions to left to lift your foot", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so you really have to focus on on", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and decide the level of abstraction that you aim at it zero in on that ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and more or less ignore the rest , unless there is some implications that you want to constant draw from sub - tasks that are relevant", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but very difficult .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the other thing that thought of is that you could want to go to the bakery because you 're supposed to meet your friend there or som", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so you like being able to infer the second thing is very useful and probably often .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "the the utterance was \" is there bakery around here ? \" ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but having them separate", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "not \" want to go to bakery . \"", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "their friend said they were going to meet them in bakery around the area .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and 'm , 'm inventing contexts which are unlikely ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but it 's still the case that you could you could override that default by giving extra information", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "which is to me reason why you would keep the inference of that separate from the knowledge of \" they really want to there 's bakery around here \" ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "which is direct .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "there there should never be hard coded shortcut from the bakery question to the double schema thing ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , , when have traveled with my friends we make these exactly these kinds of appointments .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's met someone at the bakery in the victoria station train station london before ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "have question about the slot of the spg action .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the enter - view - approach the the eva , those are fixed slots in this particular action .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "every action of this kind will have choice .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or or will it just", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "every spg every spg action either is an enter or view or an approach ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so so for each particular action that you may want to characterize you would have some number of slots that define in some way what this action is all about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it can be either , or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so is it fixed number or do you leave it open it could be between one and fifteen", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's it 's flexible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it depends on if you actually write down the schema", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then you have to say it 's either one of them", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or it can be none ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or it can be any of them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "however the it seems to be sensible to me to to view them as mutually exclusive", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you mean within the source - path - goal actions ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and how where is the end ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there actually by my question is simpler than that ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you have an spg action", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it has three different aspects", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because you can either enter building or view it or approach it and touch it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now you define another action ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's it 's called - one", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "forced action or forced motion .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "different action . and this action - two would have various variable possibilities of interpreting what you would like to do . and in way similar to either enter - view - approach you may want to send letter , read letter , or dictate letter , let 's say .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if 'm gonna answer your question or not with this ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the categories inside of action schemas ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , spg action is category .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "although what we 're specifying here is this is category where the actions \" enter , view and approach \" would fall into", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because they have related source - path - goal schema in our tourist domain .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "cuz viewing in tourist domain is going up to it and or actually going from one place to another to take picture , in this in", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it 's automatic derived fr from the structure that is built elsewhere .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is cate this category structure here ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "what are some types of action schemas ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "one of the types of action schemas is source - path - goal action .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and what are some types of that ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and an enter , view , an approach .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "those are all source - path - goal actions .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "inside of enter there will be roles that can be filled .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if want to go from outside to inside then you 'd have the roles that need to filled , where you 'd have source - path - goal set of roles .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you 'd the source would be outside and path is to the door or whatever ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if you wanted to have new type of action you 'd create new type of category .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then this category would we would put it", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we would put new action in the in the categories that in which it has the", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "every action has set of related schemas", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like source - path - goal or force , whatever ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we would put \" write letter \" in the categories that in which it had it had schemas", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there could be communication event action like that", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "schemas that of that type .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you could write it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then later , , there the we have communication event action where we 'd define it down there as", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so there 's bit redundancy ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "in which the things that go into particular you have categories at the top under action schema", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and the things that go under particular category are supposed to have corresponding schema definition for that type .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so what 's the function of having it up there too ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "'m wondering whether you could just have", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "under action schema you could just say whatever it 's gonna be enter , view or approach or whatever number of things", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and pos partly because you need to know somewhere that those things fall into some categories .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and it may be multiple categories as you say which is the reason why it gets little messy", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but if it has if it 's supposed to be categorized in category then the corresponding schema will be among the structures that follow .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "this is one of things we were arguing about .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is this is more this is probably the way that that 's the way that seemed more intuitive to johno", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you didn't tell me to", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "also for while for", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but now you have seen the light .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "no , no . we have not we have not seen the light .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the the reason one reason we 're doing it this way is in case there 's extra structure that 's in the enter action that 's not captured by the schemas ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's easy to go back and forth", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "which is why would think you would say enter", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and then just say all the things that are relevant specifically to enter .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and then the things that are abstract will be
