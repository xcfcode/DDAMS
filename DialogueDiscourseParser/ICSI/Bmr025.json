so as soon as we hear from brian that this one is", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "is my mike on ?", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and we get the transcript back", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and we find out that hopefully there are no problems matching up the transcript with what we gave them ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "then we 'll be ready to go and we 'll just send them the next four as big batch ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and let them work on that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and so we 're doing those as disjoint from the ones we 're transcribing here ?", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "we 're doing things in parallel ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that way we can get as much done at once .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that 's the way to do it ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "especially for the information retrieval .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "anything else on transcription status ?", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "we had the submeeting the other day .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so 've been working on using the thisl tools to do information retrieval on meeting data", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and the thisl tools are there 're two sets , there 's back - end and front - end ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so the front - end is the user interface", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and the back - end is the indexing tool and the querying tool .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and so 've written some tools to convert everything into the for file formats .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and the command line version of the indexing and the querying is now working .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so at least on the one meeting that had the transcript for conveniently you can now do information retrieval on it ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "do type in string and get back list of start - end times for the meeting ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "what what what does that look like ? the string that you type in .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "what are you are they keywords , or are they ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "? and so and then it munges it to pass it to the thisl ir which uses an sgml - like format for everything .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and then does it play something back", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or that 's something you 're having to program ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now , have tool that will do that on command line using our standard tools ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "but my intention is to do prettier user interface based either", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so so that 's the other thing wanted to discuss , is what should we do for the user interface ?", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "we have two tools that have already been written .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "the softsound did web - based one ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "which haven't used , haven't looked at .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "dan says it 's pretty good", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "but it does mean you need to be running web server .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and so it 's pretty big and complex .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and it would be difficult to port to windows", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "because it means porting the web server to windows .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "the other option is dan did the tcl - tk thisl gui front - end for broadcast news", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "that 's demo .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and that would be much easier to port to windows .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and so that 's the way we should go .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so as it stands within the channeltrans interface , it 's possible to do find and play .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can find searched string and play .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so are you so you 're adding like , , are they fuzzy matches or are they ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's standard , text - retrieval - based", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so it 's term frequency , inverse document frequency scoring .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and then there are all sorts of metrics for spacing", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "how far apart they have to be and things like that .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "it 's lot more sophisticated than the the windows - based", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's like doing google query or anyth anything else like that .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so it uses so it pr produces an index ahead of time", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so you don't you 're not doing linear search through all the documents .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "cuz you can imagine if with if we have the sixty hours ' worth you do wouldn't wanna do search .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "you have to do preindexing", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and so that these tools do all that .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and so the work to get the front - end to work would be porting it", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "to get it to work on the unix systems , our side is just rewriting them and modifying them to work for meetings .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so that it understands that they 're different speakers and that it 's one big audio file instead of bunch of little ones and just sorta things like that .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so what does the user see as the result of the query ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "on which tool ?", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "the thisl gui tool which is the one that dan wrote , tcl - tk", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "you type in query and then you get back list of hits", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and you can type on them and listen to them .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "click on them rather with mouse .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so if you typed in \" small heads \" you could", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "get back something that would let you click and listen to some audio where that phrase had occurred", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "you you 'd get to listen to \" beep \" .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "that was really good look .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's too bad that couldn't come into the", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you couldn't get video .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "who practice on ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "at some point we 're gonna have to say what that private joke is ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that keeps coming up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then again , not .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that soun that sounds reasonable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it loo it my recollection of it is it 's it 's pretty reasonable demo format .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that sounds good .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and so there 'd be minimal effort to get it to work , minimally", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "that sounds really neat .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and then we 'd wanna add things like query by speaker and by meeting and all that .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "dave gelbart expressed some interest in working on that", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so 'll work with him on it .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and it 's looking pretty good ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "the fact that got the query system working .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so if we wanna just do video - based one that 'll be easy .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "if we wanna get it to windows it 's gonna be little more work", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "because the thisl ir , the information retrieval tool 's ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "had difficulty just compiling them on solaris .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so getting them to compile on windows might be challenging .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "but you were saying that the that there 's that set of tools , , cygnus tools , that", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it certainly helps .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "without those wouldn't even attempt it .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "but what those they what those do is provide bsd compatibility layer ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so that the normal unix function calls all work .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and you have to have all the", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but the problem is that the thisl tools didn't use anything like autoconf", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and so you have the normal porting problems of different header files and some things are defined and some things aren't", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and different compiler work - arounds and so on .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so the fact that it took me day to get it to compile under solaris means it 's probably gonna take me significantly more than that to get it to compile under windows .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "how about having it run under free bsd ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "free bsd would probably be easier .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "all you need to do is say to dan \" gee it would be if this worked under autoconf \" and it 'll be done in day .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's true .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "because he did port it to sprachcore", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so he might have done that already .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "wouldn't be surprised .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "'ll check at that", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "but it would what would serve would serve both purposes , is if you contact him and ask him if he 's already done it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how does it play ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "if he has then you learn ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if he hasn't then he 'll do it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "hope he never listens to these meetings .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , and 've been corresponding with dan and also with , softsound guy ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "it 's amazing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "blanking on his name .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "or or steve renals .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "steve renal - steve renals .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which one do ?", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "steve renals is not softsound ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "my brain is not working ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "don't remember who 've been corresponding with .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "steve wro it 's ste - steve renals wrote thisl ir .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "then it 's steve renals .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so just getting documentation and and and formats ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so that 's all going pretty ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "what about issues of playing sound files @ @ between the two platforms ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we 'll be with that .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "that 's good point too .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "here 's here 's crazy idea actually .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "why don't you try and merge transcriber and thisl ir ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "they 're both tcl interfaces .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "this is one of the reasons", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "this is the one of the reasons that 'm gonna have dave gelbart", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "having him volunteer to work on it is really good thing", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "because he 's worked on the transcriber", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and he 's more familiar with tcl - tk than am .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and then you get they then you get the windows media playing for free .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's snack , not transcriber .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "but that the transcriber uses snack and then you can but you can use lot of the same functionality", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": ", , thisl gui probably uses snack .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and so my intention was just to base it on that .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "my thought was is that it would be it would be to have the running transcripts , from speaker to speaker .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and if it doesn't", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "do you have you have , , speaker mark here and speaker mark here ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we 'll have to figure out user interface for that , so .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "that my thought was if you had like multitrans or whatever do it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it might be fairly difficult to get that to work in the little short segments we 'd be talking about", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and having the search tools and so on .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "we we can look into it ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "the thing was asking about with , , free bsd is that it might be easier to", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "get powerpoint shows running in free bsd than to get this other package running in", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have to have to sit down and try it before make too many judgments ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "my experience with the gnu compatibility library is really it 's just as hard and just as easy to port to any system .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "the windows system isn't any harder", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "because it looks like bsd system .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "it 's just , , just like all of them , the \" include \" files are little different and the function calls are little different .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so it might be little easier", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "but it 's not gonna be lot easier .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so there was that demo , which was one of the main ones ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then we talked about some other", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which would be showing off the transcriber interface itself", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and as you say , we could even merge those in some sense ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and part of that was showing off what the speech - non nonspeech that thilo has done looks like .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can ask one more thing about thisl ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so with the ir then you end up with somewhat prioritized ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so another idea had just now actually for the demo was whether it might be of interest to sh to show some of the prosody work that don 's been doing .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "actually show some of the features", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and then show task like finding sentence boundaries or finding turn boundaries .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "you can show that graphically , what the features are doing .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it , , it doesn't work but it 's definitely giving us something .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "at the very least we 're gonna want something illustrative with that", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if that would be of interest or not .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "cuz 'm gonna want to talk about it", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so if there 's something that shows it graphically it 's much better than me just having bullet point", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "pointing at something much about ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you 're looking at this now", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "are you looking at waves or matlab ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we can probably find some examples of different type of prosodic events going on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so when we here were having this demo meeting , what we 're coming up with is that we wanna have all these pieces together , to first order , by the end of the month", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then that 'll give us week or so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ooo . the end of", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the end of this month or next month ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "you mean like today ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "june . june .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "today isn't june first ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "there 's another one .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that 'll give us that 'll give us week or so to to port things over to my laptop and make that works ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'ll be here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if if don can talk to whoever 's", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "cuz we 're doing this anyway as part of our , the research ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "visualizing what these features are doing", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it might not be integrated", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but it could potentially be in it .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": ", this is to an audience of researchers", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "could find some .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "to let the goal is to let them it is we 're doing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's different .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "don't think anyone has done this on meeting data", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so it might be neat , .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "done with that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so 've been doing bunch of xml tools", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "where you we 're moving to xml as the general format for everything", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and that 's definitely the way to go", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "because there are lot of tools that let you do extraction and reformatting of xml tools .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so yet again we should probably meet to talk about transcription formats in xml", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "because 'm not particularly happy with what we have now .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "it works with transcriber", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "but it 's pain to use it in other tools", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "because it doesn't mark start and end .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "start and end of each ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so it 's implicit in there", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "but you have to do lot of processing to get it .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and so and also 'd like to do the indirect time line business .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "but regardless , , that 's something that you , me , and jane can talk about later .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "but 've installed xml tools of various sorts in various languages", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and so if people are interested in doing extracting any information from any of these files ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "either information on users because the user database is that way", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "'m converting the key files to xml so that you can extract various inf sorted information on individual meetings", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and then also the transcripts .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and so just let me know there", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "it 's mostly java and perl", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "but we can get other languages too if that 's desirable .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "quick question on that . is do we have the seat information ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "in in the key files now ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "the seat information is on the key files for the ones which", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "for the new one", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's been recorded ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "where where you 're sitting .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "! not not the quality or anything . no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "\" it 's pretty soft and squishy . \"", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "but that might just be me .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "that 's more seat information than we wanted .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'m just trying to figure out , , when morgan 's voice appears on someone 's microphone are they next to him or are they across from him ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we should bleep that out .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "how where is it in the key file ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the square bracket .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "cuz haven't been putting it in", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "you haven't been putting it in .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "isn't it always on the digits ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "some of these are missing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "isn't it always on the digits forms ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "some fall out of", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we can go back and fill them in for the ones we have .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "they 're on , these ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but hadn't ever been putting it in the key files .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and don't think chuck was either", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "never knew we were supposed to put it in the key file .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "had told you about it", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so we 're both .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "this is why wanna use tool to do it rather than the plain text", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "because with the plain text it 's very easy to skip those things .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "if you use the edit - key ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "or key - edit", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "edit - key .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's edit - key , command", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "did show you that ?", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "you mentioned it ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "did show it to you ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "but you both said \" no , you 'll just use text file \" .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "it has it in there , place to fill it in .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and so if you don't fill it in , you 're not gonna get it in the meetings .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "realized hadn't been doing it", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and then the other thing also that thilo noticed is , on the microphone ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "on channel zero it says hand - held mike or crown mike ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "you actually have to say which one .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "! . didn't do that either .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "takes me no time to edit these .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but it 's almost", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 's cuz you kn", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "'m not doing anything .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and was was looking at chuck 's , like , \" what did chuck do ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "'ll do that \" .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and then also in couple of places instead of filling the participants under \" participants \" they were filled in under \" description \" .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and so that 's also problem .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "we will do better .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 's it .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "also 'm working on another version of this tool ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "the one that shows up here , that will flash yellow if the mike isn't connected .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and it 's not quite ready to go yet", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "because it 's hard to tell whether the mike 's connected or not", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "because the best quality ones , the crown ones , are about the same level if they 're off", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and no one 's off or if they 're on and no one 's talking .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "these ones , they are much easier ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "there 's bigger difference .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so 'm working on that", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and it sorta works", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and so eventually we will change to that", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and then you 'll be able to see graphically if your mike is dropping in or out .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "will that also include like batteries dying ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just any time the mike 's putting out zeros .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but with the screensaver kicking in , it", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "'ll turn off the screensaver too .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "speaking of which .", "speaker":

"speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so having it on the screen is more easy to notice .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "it would be if these had little light indicators ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "\" bamp ,

that we would be reserving the non - backed - up space for things that took less than twenty - four hours to recreate like that ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "things that are recreatable easily and also , things that are recreatable .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "the expanded files and things like that .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "they take up lot more room anyway .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "but we do need more disk .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so we can get more disk .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and agree with him .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "his point was taken that if we lose one of these we cannot get it back .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "don't think there was any other et cetera there .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "was allowing someone else to come up with something related that they had", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you were gonna burn ds ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "unfortunately we could burn ds but first of all it 's pain .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "because you have to copy it down to the pc and then burn it", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and that 's multi - step procedure .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and second of all the write - once burners as opposed to professional press don't last .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so burning them for distribution is fine", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "but burning them for backup is not good idea .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "cuz they fail after couple years .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "do have it 's different topic . can add one top topic ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have time ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wanted to ask ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "know that that thilo you were , , bringing the channeltrans interface onto the windows machine ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's it it 's done ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's all done ? that 's wonderful . .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , since tcl - tk runs on it , things 'll just work .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "it was just problem with the snack version and the transcriber version", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it 's solved .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "does and that does that mean ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should know this but don't .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does this mean that the that this could be por ported to think - pad note or some other type of", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did install it on my laptop", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "good . crosspads ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "got an email from james landay", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "who said \" if you 're not using them , could you return them ? \"", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so he said he doesn't need them , he just periodically at the end of each term sends out email to everyone who was recorded as having them", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and asks them if they 're still using them .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so we 've never used them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we used them once .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we we used them couple times ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "there 's more than one ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we have two .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "my opinion on it is ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "first , never take notes anyway", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so 'm not gonna use it ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and second , it 's another level of infrastructure that we have to deal with .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and have so my feeling on it is that in principle it 's really idea ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you have the time tags which makes it better tha than just taking ra raw notes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "on the other hand , the down side for me was that the pen is really noisy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you have ka kaplunk , kaplunk .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and and if it 's audible on the", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that was disadvantage .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do take notes ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "could be taking notes on these things", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the plus with the crosspads would be the time markings", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what is crosspad ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it 's it 's it 's regular pad , just regular pad of paper but there 's this pen which indicates position .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so you have time and position stored", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that you can you have record of whatever it is you 've written .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then you can download it", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and they have ocr and searching and all sorts of things .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so if you take notes it 's little device .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "but don't take notes ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and one of the reasons that it was brought up originally was because we were interested in higher - level things ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not just the , , microphone but also summarization and", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the question is if you were going to go to some gold standard of what wa what was it that happened in the meeting , where would it come from ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that was one of the things ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so the it seemed like neat idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we 'll have , have scribe ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have somebody take good notes and then that 's part of the record of the meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then we did it once or twice and we", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then just died out .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "probably chose the wrong scribe", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it was it 's", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "did it one time", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the other thing 'm thinking is if we wanted that thing wonder if we 'd lose that much by having someone be scribe", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "by listening to the tape , to the recording afterwards", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and taking notes in some other interface .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we 're transcribing it anyways ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "why do we need notes ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's la it 's useful ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because that 's summary .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "have summary and high points .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there 's this use that", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "summarize it from the transcription .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "what if you 're sitting there and you just wanna make an", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and you don't wanna take notes", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and you 're you just wanna", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "get the summary of the transcript from this time location", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "like , and then while you 're bored you don't do anything", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and once in while , there 's joke and you put", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "in other words you can use that just to highlight times in very simple way .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "also with was thinking and know morgan disagrees with me on this", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but suppose you have group in here and you wanna let them note whenever they think there might be something later that they might not wanna distribute in terms of content ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "they could just make an near that point", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "or question mark that alerts them that when they get the transcript back they could get some red flags in that transcript region", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and they can then look at it .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "know we haven't been using it", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but imagine it being useful just for marking time periods", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "which you then get back in transcript", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so , , what makes one is we should actually schedule some periods where people go over something later", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and and put some summary", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "some there 'd be some scribe who would actually listen , who 'd to actually listen to the whole thing ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not transcribe it , but just write down things that struck them as important .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but then you don't you don't have the time reference that you 'd have if you had it live .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you don't have lot of other cues that might be useful ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "how do you synchronize the time in the crosspad and the time of the recording ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that was one of the issues we talked about originally", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and that 's part of the difficulty is that we need an infrastructure for using the time the crosspads", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and so that means synchronizing the time", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "you want it pretty close", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and there 's fair amount of skew because it 's hand - held unit with battery", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so you have to synchronize at the beginning of each meeting all the pads that are being used ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so that it 's synchronized with the time on that", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and then you have to download to an application ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and then you have to figure out what the data formats are and convert it over if you wanna do anything with this information .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and so there 's lot of infrastructure which", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "there is an alternative .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there is an alternative ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's still , there 's , your point stands about there be needing to be an infrastructure ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it doesn't have to be synchronized with the little clock 's timer on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you , when did it synchronized it by voice ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "by whispering \" one , two , three , four \" onto the microphone", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then there 's the infrastructure at the other end", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "which someone has to listen to that and find that point ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "it 's transcribed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's in the transcript .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then mark it .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "it 's in the transcript .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "could we keep one of these things for another year ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "would is there big cau", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we can keep all both of them for the whole year .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "just in case we", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "even some of the transcribers who might be wanting to annotate", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "just there 's bunch of things that might be neat to do", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but it might not be the case that we can actually synchronize them and then do all the infrastructure", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but we could at least try it out .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "one thing that we might try is on some set of meetings , some collection of meetings , edu is the one else ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "part of the reason part of the reason that adam was so interested in the speechcorder idea from the beginning is he said from the beginning he hated taking notes", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so and jane is more into it", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you wanna really do this all the time", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so to get someone to actually buy into it", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and have at least some series of meetings where we do it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if so , it 's probably worth having one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the the problem with the more extended view ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "all these other with quibbling about particular applications of it", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that it looks like it 's hard to get people to routinely use it ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it just hasn't happened anyway .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if we can get person to", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't has to be part of what everybody does in meeting", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but it might be useful , neat part of the project", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that we can , , show off as mechanism for synchronizing events in time", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that happen that you just wanna make note of ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "like what jane was talking about", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "with some later browsing , just as convenience ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "even if it 's not full - blown note taking substitute .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "if you wanted to do that the architecture for it is to get pda with wireless card .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and and that way you can synchronize very easily with the the meeting", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because you 'll be synchroni you can synchronize with the linux server", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so what input would you be ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so , , if you 're not worried about", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you 'd just be pressing like", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and may and you could have the same interface or whatever ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you 'd have to do little little bit of coding to do it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but you could imagine ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that be good .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "if all you really wanted was you didn't want this secondary note - taking channel", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but just being able to use markers of some sort ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "pda with wireless card would be the probably the way to go .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "even buttons you could do ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "as you said .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "for what you 've been describing buttons would be even more convenient than anything else ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "that would be fine too .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "don't have , , grandiose ideas in mind", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but 'm just thinking we 've we 're getting into the next year now", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and we have lot of these things worked out at in terms of the speech", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "somebody will be interested in this", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "like this pda idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do like the idea of having couple buttons", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "where like one button was \" - \"", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then another button was \" that 's \"", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and another button \" that 's \"", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or like this is my \" 'm supposed to do this \" button ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "like \" better remember to \"", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "the crosspad idea is good one .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "it 's just question of getting people to use it", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and getting the infrastructure set up in such way that it 's not lot of extra work .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "that 's part of the reason why it hasn't happened", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "is that it 's been lot of extra work for me", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and not just for you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it 's also , it has this problem of having to go from an analog to digital record too ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's digital but it 's in format that is not particularly standard .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "but , say , if if you 're writing if you 're writing notes in it does it can't do handwriting recognition ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , no , but it 's just it 's just storing the pixel informa position information ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's all digital .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what 'm thinking is that the pda solution you you have it already without needing to go from the pixelization to to", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you don't have to", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the transfer function is less errorful ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it also it 's realistic cuz people are supposed to be bringing their as to the meeting eventually ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 's why we have this little", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "what don't wanna more work for anyone", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but imagine some interesting things that you could do with it", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and so if we don't have to return it", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and we can keep it for year", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we don't we certainly don't have to return it ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "as said . all all he said is that if you 're not using it could you return it , if you are using it feel free to keep it .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "that we haven't used it", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and are we going to ?", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so we have no", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but by would suggest you return one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because we , we haven't used it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have some aspirations of using them", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one would probably be fine .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we could do like student project ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "someone who wants to do this as their main like project would be .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "if we had them out and sitting on the table people might use them little more", "speaker": "H"},

bad", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "jeremy 's gonna be an he 's new student starting on modeling brea breath and laughter , actually ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but it should be ,", "speaker": "G"},

that .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "we ordered more wireless ,", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and so they should be coming in at some point .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "and then at the same time 'll probably rewire the room as per jane 's suggestion", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so that the first channels are wireless , are the the close - talking and the next are far - field .", "speaker": "H"},

're wiring you 're you we 're we ordered more absence of the thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's very philosophical statement from morgan .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "wired less , wired more .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "it 's anachronism ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "should we do digits ?", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "do we have anything else ?", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "there 's
