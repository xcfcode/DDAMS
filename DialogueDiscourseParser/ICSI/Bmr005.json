if you wanna find all the places where there were overlap , it 's probably better to use distant mike .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's good .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "on the other hand , there 's other phenomena that are going on at the same time for which it might be useful to look at the close - talking mikes ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but why can't you use the combination of the close - talking mikes , time aligned ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you use the combination of the close - talking mikes , you would hear jane interrupting me ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but you wouldn't hear the paper rustling .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and so if you 're interested in", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "if you 're interested in speakers overlapping other speakers and not the other kinds of nonspeech , that 's not problem ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "some of it 's masking masked .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "were you interrupting him or was he interrupting you ?",

"saw the speech file collected by the fet mike ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and signal to to noise relation is low .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's low .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's very low . you would comp if we compare it with the headphone .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "found that nnn that , ehm , pr probably ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'m not by the moment ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it 's it 's probably that lot of ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in the overlapping zone , on in several parts of the files where you can find , smooth speech from one talker in the in the meeting ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's probably in that in those files you can not find you can not process", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because it 's confused with noise .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and there are lot of", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but have to study with more detail .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but my idea is to process only nnn , this nnn , this of speech .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because it 's more realistic .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'m not it 's good idea , but", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's more realistic but it 'll it 'll be lot harder .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 'd be hard , but on the other hand as you point out , if your if if your concern is to get the overlapping people 's speech , you will you will get that somewhat better .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "are you making any use", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you were you were working with the data that had already been transcribed .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "with by jane .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now did you make any use of that ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "see was wondering cuz we st we have these ten hours of other that is not yet transcribed .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the the transcription by jane , , want to use to nnn , to put", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's reference for me .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the transcription , don't 'm not interested in the in the words , transcription words , transcribed in follow in the in the in the speech file , but jane put mark at the beginning of each talker ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in the in the meeting ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "she nnn includes information about the zone where there are there is an overlapping zone .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but there isn't any mark , time temporal mark , to to mmm - heh , to label the beginning and the end of the of the", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ta 'm we need this information to", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the twelve you it took you twelve hours this included some time where you were learning about what you wanted to do ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but , it took you something like twelve hours to mark the forty - five minutes , your", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you did forty - five minutes of", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "no , forty - five minutes is the is the session ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "all the session .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you haven't done the whole session .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "all is the session .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is just twelve minutes .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "tw - twelve hours of work to segment and label twelve minutes from session of part of", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so let me back up again .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so the when you said there were three hundred speaker overlaps ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's in twelve minutes ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "consider all the all the session because count the nnn the overlappings marked by jane ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in in the fin in the forty - five minutes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it 's three hundred in forty - five minutes ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but you have you have time , marked twelve minute the overlaps in twelve minutes of it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , can ask can ask whether you found , , how accurate jane 's labels were as far as", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "not just the overlaps , everything .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "did she miss some overlaps ? or did she ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but , by the moment , don't compare , my temporal mark with jane , but want to do it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because per perhaps have errors in the in the marks ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if compare with jane , it 's probably correct and to get more accurately transcription in the file .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "also jane was doing word level .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so we weren't concerned with exactly when an overlap started and stopped .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "not only word level , but actually", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'m expect 'm not expecting", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "no , it 's", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you didn't need to show the exact point of interruption ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you just were showing at the level of the phrase or the level of the speech spurt , or", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", , would say time bin .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so my goal is to get words with reference to time bin , beginning and end point .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and and sometimes , , it was like you could have an overlap where someone said something in the middle ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , , it just wasn't important for our purposes to have it that disrupt that unit in order to have , , the words in the order in which they were spoken ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it would have it would have been hard with the interface that we have .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now , my adam 's working on , on revised overlapping interface ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's it 's good work ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we need more information .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "expect you to find more overlaps than jane", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "always need more for", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "no , no . have to go to", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because you 're looking at it at much more detailed level .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "want wanted to compare the transcription .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but if it takes sixty to one", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but have suggestion about that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "this is very , very time - consuming , and you 're finding lots of things", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "which 'm are gonna be very interesting ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but in the interests of making progress , might", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "how would it affect your time if you only marked speaker overlaps ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "do not mark any other events ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but only mark speaker", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "do you think that would speed it up quite bit ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "do do you think that would speed it up ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "speed up your your marking ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "nnn , don't understand very .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it took you long time to mark twelve minutes .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "now , my suggestion was for the other thirty - three", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "on - only to mark only to mark overlapping zone , but", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and my question is , if you did that , if you followed my suggestion , would it take much less time ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "then it 's good idea .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "then it 's good idea , because it", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because need lot of time to put the label or to do that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", we know that there 's noise .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "there 's there 's continual noise from fans and ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and there is more impulsive noise from taps and", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and something in between with paper rustling .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we know that 's there", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and it 's worthwhile thing to study ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but it takes lot of time to mark all of these things .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "whereas would think that you we can study more or less as distinct phenomenon the overlapping of people talking .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so . then you can get the cuz you need", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if it 's three hundred it sounds like you probably only have fifty or sixty or seventy events now that are really", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and and you need to have lot more than that to have any even visual sense of what 's going on , much less any reasonable statistics .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "now , why do you need to mark speaker overlap by hand if you can infer it from the relative energy in the", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's what was gonna bring up .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "you shouldn't need to do this completely by hand ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", . so let 's back up because you weren't here for an earlier conversation .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so the idea was that what he was going to be doing was experimenting with different measures", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "such as the increase in energy , such as the energy in the lpc residuals , such as", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "there 's bunch of things , increased energy is - is an obvious one .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "in the far - field mike .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , it 's not obvious ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you could you could do the dumbest thing and get it ninety percent of the time .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but when you start going past that and trying to do better , it 's not obvious what combination of features is gonna give you the , the detector .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so the idea is to have some ground truth first .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and so the the idea of the manual marking was to say \" this , , it 's it 's really here \" .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but liz is saying why not get it out of the transcripts ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what is get it from the close - talking mikes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or ge get first pass from those ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we we we we talked about that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then go through", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 'd be lot faster probably to", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's his ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we we talked about that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but so it 's bootstrapping thing and ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the idea was , we thought it would be useful for him to look at the data anyway ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then whatever he could mark would be helpful ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's question of what you bootstrap from .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "do you bootstrap from simple measurement which is most of the time and then you do better ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "or do you bootstrap from some human being looking at it and then do your simple measurements , from the close - talking mike .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "even with the close - talking mike you 're not gonna get it all the time .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's what wonder , because", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or how bad it is ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "be , because that would be interesting", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'m working on program to do that , and", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "especially because the bottleneck is the transcription .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we 've got lot more data than we have transcriptions for .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have the audio data ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have the close - talking mike ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it seems like one project", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's not perfect , but", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that you can get the training data for pretty quickly is , ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you infer form the close - talking mikes where the on - off points are of speech ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we discussed that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "how can we detect that from far - field ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'ve 've written program to do that ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and so but it 's it 's doing something very , very simple .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it just takes threshold , based on the volume ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "or you can set the threshold low and then weed out the false alarms by hand .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "by hand . .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then it does median filter , and then it looks for runs .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and , it seems to work ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "'ve 'm fiddling with the parameters , to get it to actually generate something ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "don't what 'm working on was getting it to form where we can import it into the user interface that we have , into transcriber .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and so told said it would take about day .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "'ve worked on it for about half day ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "have to go .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so give me another half day and we 'll have something we can play with .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "see , this is where we really need the meeting recorder query to be working ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because we 've had these meetings and we 've had this discussion about this , and 'm remembering little bit about what we decided ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but couldn't remember all of it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , it was partly that , , give somebody chance to actually look at the data and see what these are like , partly that we have some ground truth to compare against , , when he gets his thing going ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's definitely good to have somebody look at it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was just thinking as way to speed up , the amount of", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that was that was exactly the notion that that we discussed .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "another thing we discussed was that", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it looks good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'ll be in touch .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was that there there was this already script believe that dan had written , that handle bleedthrough ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "cuz you have this close you have contamination from other people who speak loudly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and haven't tried using that .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it would probably help the program that 'm doing to first feed it through that .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's cross - correlation filter .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so haven't tried that , but that if it it might be something it might be good way of cleaning it up little .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so , some thought of having", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "having that be preprocessor and then run it through yours .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but but that 's refinement", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's what we were discussing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we wanna see try the simple thing first ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "cuz you add this complex thing up afterwards that does something good yo you wanna see what the simple thing does first .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but , having somebody have some experience , again , with with marking it from human standpoint ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we 're , don't expect jose to do it for fifty hours of speech ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but we if if he could speed up what he was doing by just getting the speaker overlaps so that we had it , say , for forty - five minutes , then at least we 'd have three hundred examples of it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and when adam was doing his automatic thing he could then compare to that and see what it was different .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "did did something almost identical to this at one of my previous jobs , and it works pretty .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "almost exactly what you described , an energy detector with median filter , you look for runs .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it seemed like the thing to do .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": ", you can get , you get them pretty close .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that was with zero literature search .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and so doing that to generate these possibilities and then going through and saying yes or no on them would be quick way to do it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's good validation .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "is this proprietary ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no . no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you have patent on it ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it was when was working for the government .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then everybody owns it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's the people .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": ", is this something that we could just co - opt ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or is it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "he 's pretty close , anyway . it 's", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "he 's it doesn't take long time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "thought if it was tried and true , then and he 's gone through additional levels of development .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "although if you if you have some parameters like what 's good window size for the median filter", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "! have to remember .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'ll think about it ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and try to remember .", "speaker": "A"},

"E"}, {"text": "di - dif different bandwidth .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was doing pretty short , , tenth of second , sorts of numbers .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": ", it if we want to", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , , we should move on to other things in limited time .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "can ask one question about his statistics ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so so in the tw twelve minutes , , if we took three hundred and divided it by four , which is about the length of twelve minutes , , 'd expect like there should be seventy - five overlaps .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "did you find more than seventy - five overlaps in that period , or ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how many overlaps in your twelve minutes ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "onl - only transcribe only twelve minutes from the", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but don't co don't count the overlap .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "consider the the nnn the the three hundred is considered only you your transcription .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have to finish transcribing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "bet they 're more , because the beginning of the meeting had lot more overlaps than the middle .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "middle or end .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "because we 're we 're dealing with the , in the early meetings ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we 're recording while we 're saying who 's

{"text": "we could find that out .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'m 'm not that the beginning had more .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so so was gonna ask , about any other things that that either of you wanted to talk about ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "especially since andreas is leaving in five minutes ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that you wanna go with .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "can ask about the data ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like very straightforward question is where we are on the amount of data and the amount of transcribed data ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wanted to get feel for that", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to be able to can be done first", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and like how many meetings are we recording", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so there 's this there 's this forty - five minute piece that jane transcribed .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that piece was then sent to ibm so they could transcribe so we have some comparison point .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "then there 's larger piece that 's been recorded and put on cd - rom and sent to ibm .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then we .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "how many meetings is that ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what 's that ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that was about ten hours , and there was about", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "ten it 's like ten meetings ?", "speaker": "C"},

missing files .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 's , that had those have not been sent .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "how many total have we recorded now , altogether ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we 're saying about twelve hours .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "about twelve by now . twelve or thirteen .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "- . and we 're recording only this meeting , like continuously", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we 're only recording this one now ? or ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , so the that 's the biggest one , chunk so far ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it was the morning one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but there 's at least one meeting recorded of the natural language .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "do they meet every week ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we talked to them about recording some more", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and we 're going to ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we 've started having morning meeting , today starting week or two ago , on the front - end issues ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and we 're recording those ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "there 's network services and applications group here who 's to have their

"speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so actually , we 're gonna start having pretty significant chunk", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , , adam 's struggling with trying to get things to be less buggy , and come up quicker when they do crash and things like that ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "now that the things are starting to happen .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so now , , 'd say the data is predominantly meeting meetings ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but there are scattered other meetings in it and that amount is gonna grow", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so that the meeting meetings will probably ultimately", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if we 're if we collect fifty or sixty hours , the meeting meetings it will probably be , , twenty or thirty percent of it ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "not not eighty or ninety .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so there 's probably there 's three to four week ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's what we 're aiming for .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that we 're aiming for .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they 're each about an hour .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we 'll find out tomorrow whether we can really do this or not .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and the other thing is 'm not pos", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "'m thinking as we 've been through this few times , that really", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you wanna do it once for the novelty ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but if in general we wanna have meetings that we record from outside this group do the digits .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because it 's just an added bunch of weird .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and , , we we 're highly motivated .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the morning group is really motivated", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "cuz they 're working on connected digits ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "actually that 's something wanted to ask ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "is have bunch of scripts to help with the transcription of the digits .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we don't have to hand - transcribe the digits because we 're reading them and have those .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and so have some scripts that let you very quickly extract the sections of each utterance .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but haven't been ru haven't been doing that .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "if did that , is someone gonna be working on it ?",

the numbers would be extremely helpful to do adaptation .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "would really like someone to do adaptation .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so if we got someone interested in that , it would be for meeting recorder .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "one of the things wanted to do , , that talked to don about , is one of the possible things he could do or also , we could have someone else do it , is to do block echo cancellation ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "since it 's the same people over and over .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "to try to get rid of some of the effects of the the far - field effects .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we have the party line has been that echo cancellation is not the way to handle the situation", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because people move around ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and , if it 's if it 's not simple echo , like cross - talk echo , but it 's actually room acoustics , it 's it 's you can't really do inversion ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and even echo cancellation is going to be something it may you someone may be moving enough that you are not able to adapt quickly", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and so the tack that we 've taken is more \" lets come up with feature approaches and multi - stream approaches and , that will be robust to it for the recognizer and not try to create clean signal \" .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's the party line .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but it occurred to me few months ago that party lines are always , , dangerous .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's good to test them , actually .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and so we haven't had anybody try to do good serious job on echo cancellation and we should know how that can do .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so that 's something 'd like somebody to do at some point , just take these digits , take the far - field mike signal , and the close mike signal , and apply really good echo cancellation .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "there was have been some talks recently by lucent on their", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the block echo cancellation particularly appealed to me ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "trying and change it sample by sample , but you have some reasonable sized blocks . and , ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "what is the the artifact you try to you 're trying to get rid of when you do that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it 's it you have direct", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "what 's the difference in if you were trying to construct linear filter , that would", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "'m signing off .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that would subtract off the parts of the signal that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close - talk and the distant .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so in most echo cancellation", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so you given that", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so you 're trying to so you 'd there 's distance between the close and the distant mikes so there 's time delay there ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and after the time delay , there 's these various reflections .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and if you figure out what 's the", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "there 's least squares algorithm that adjusts itself adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract essentially to subtract off different different reflections .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "? so let 's take the simple case where you just had you had some some delay in satellite connection", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then there 's there 's an echo .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it comes back . and you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so that would mean like if you were listening to the data that was recorded on one of those .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just the raw data ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you would you might hear an echo ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and and then this noise cancellation would get", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'m 'm saying that 's simplified version of what 's really happening . what 's really happening is", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "when 'm talking to you now , you 're getting the direct sound from my speech ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but you 're also getting , , the indirect sound that 's bounced around the room number of times .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so now , if you try to you to completely remove the effect of that is impractical for number of technical reasons ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "not to try to completely remove it , that is , invert the room response ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but just to try to eliminate some of the effect of some of the echos .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "number of people have done this", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so that , say , if you 're talking to speakerphone , it makes it more like it would be , if you were talking up to it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so this is the st the straight - forward approach .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you say want to use this this item but want to subtract off various kinds of echos .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so you construct filter , and you have this filtered version of the speech gets gets subtracted off from the original speech .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "then you try to you try to minimize the energy in some sense .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and so with some constraints .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "clean up thing , that", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's clean up thing . .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , echo cancelling is , , commonly done in telephony ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and and it 's the obvious thing to do in this situation if you if , , you 're gonna be talking some distance from mike .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "when , would have meetings with the folks in cambridge when was at bbn over the phone , they had some special speaker phone", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and when they would first connect me , it would come on and we 'd hear all this noise .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then it was and then it would come on and it was very clear ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it 's taking samples , it 's doing adaptation , it 's adjusting weights ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then it 's getting the sum .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , anyway that 's that 's reasonable thing that 'd like to have somebody try", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "somebody look and and the digits would be reasonable thing to do that with .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 'd be enough data plenty of data to do that with ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and for that task you wouldn't care whether it was large vocabulary speech or anything .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "is brian kingsbury 's work related to that ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or is it different type of reverberation ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "brian 's kingsbury 's work is an example of what we did from the opposite dogma .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "which is what was calling the \" party line \" , which is that doing that thing is not really what we want .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we want something more flexible , where people might change their position ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and there might be ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's if you have clean situation but you just have some delays ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "then we 'll figure out the the set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those echos .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but if there 's noise , then the very signal that it 's looking at is corrupted", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so that it 's decision about what the , delays are is , is delayed signal is is incorrect .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and so , in noisy situation , , also in in situation that 's very reverberant with long reverberation times and really long delays , it 's it 's typically impractical .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so for those reasons ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and also complete inversion ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if you actually mentioned that it 's hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's difficult because often times the the system transfer function is such that when it 's inverted you get something that 's unstable ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and so , if you do your estimate of what the system is , and then you try to invert it , you get filter that actually , , rings , and goes to infinity .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so it 's so there 's there 's that technical reason , and the fact that things move , and there 's air currents", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "there 's all sorts of all sorts of reasons why it 's not really practical .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so for all those kinds of reasons , we we , concluded we didn't want to in do inversion ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and we 're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation , which isn't really inversion ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and we decided to do this approach of taking , just picking features , which were will give you more something that was more stable , in the presence of , or absence of , room reverberation ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and that 's what brian was trying to do .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , , let me just say couple things that was was gonna bring up .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "let 's see . you actually already said this thing about the about the consent forms ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "which was that we now don't have to", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so this was the human subjects folks who said this , or that ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the , we 're gonna do revised form , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but once person has signed it once , then that 's valid for certain number of meetings .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "she wanted me to actually estimate how many meetings and put that on the consent form .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "told her that would be little bit difficult to say .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so from practical standpoint , we could have them do it once every ten meetings , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it won't be that many people who do it that often ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but just , , so long as they don't forget that they 've done it , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "back on the data thing ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so there 's this one hour , ten hour , hundred hour thing that we have .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we have we have an hour that is transcribed ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we have we have twelve hours that 's recorded but not transcribed ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and at the rate we 're going , by the end of the semester we 'll have , , forty or fifty , if we if this really", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "do we have that much ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's three to four per week .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let 's see ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so that 's what , that", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "eight weeks , is", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so that 's not lot of hours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "eight weeks times three hours is twenty - four , so that 's , so like thirty hours ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "know this sounds tough but we 've got the room set up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was starting to think of some projects where you would use", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "similar to what we talked about with energy detection on the close - talking mikes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are number of interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in meeting , that don't require any transcription .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what are the patterns , the energy patterns over the meeting ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and 'm really interested in this but we don't have whole lot of data .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so was thinking , , we 've got the room set up", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you can always think of , also for political reasons , if icsi collected , two hundred hours , that looks different than forty hours , even if we don't transcribe it ourselves ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but don't think we 're gonna stop at the end of this semester .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , that if we are able to keep that up for few months , we are gonna have more like hundred hours .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "is there are there any other meetings here that we can record , especially meetings that have some conflict in them or some deci", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that have some more emotional aspects to them ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we had some good ones earlier .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "there 's laughter ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'m talking more about strong differences of opinion meetings ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "with manager types , or", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's hard to record those .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "to be allowed to record them ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's also likely that people will cancel out afterwards .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but but wanted to raise the kpfa idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if there is , anyway .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was gonna mention that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's good idea .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 's that would be good match .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so . so , 'd mentioned to adam , and that was another thing was gonna talk , mention to them before that there 's it it oc it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to acquaintances in local broadcast media .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because , , we had talked before about the problem about using found data , that it 's just set up however they have it set up", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and we don't have any say about it", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and it 's typically one microphone ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "in , or and so it doesn't really give us the the characteristics we want .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and so do think we 're gonna continue recording here and record what we can .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but , it did occur to me that we could go to friends in broadcast media and say \" you have this panel show , or this , this discussion show , and can you record multi - channel ? \"", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and they may be willing to record it with", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "with lapel mikes ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they probably already use lapel ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but they might be able to have it wouldn't be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it wouldn't be exactly this setup , but it would be that thing ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and what we were gonna get from uw , , assuming they they start recording , isn't als also is not going to be this exact setup .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "no , that 'd be ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we can get more data .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , was thinking of looking into that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion , , is that it 's even possible , since , many radio shows are not live , that we could invite them to have like some of their record some of their shows here .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "or , they 're not as averse to wearing one of these head - mount", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they 're on the radio ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as we are .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so . , that 'd be fantastic", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "cuz those kinds of panels and those have interesting", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "- that 's an side of style style that we 're not collecting here ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 'd be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and and the , the other side to it was the what which is where we were coming from 'll talk to you more about it later is that there 's there 's", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the radio stations and television stations already have worked out presumably , related to , , legal issues and permissions and all that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "they already do what they do whatever they do .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so it 's , it 's so it 's so it 's another source .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so it 's something we should look into ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we 'll collect what we collect here", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "hopefully they will collect more at uw also", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and and we have this other source .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but that it 's not unreasonable to aim at getting , , significantly in excess of hundred hours .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that was our goal .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the thing was , was hoping that we could @ @ in the under this controlled situation we could at least collect , , thirty to fifty hours .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and at the rate we 're going we 'll get pretty close to that this semester .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and if we continue to collect some next semester , we should ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "was mostly trying to think , \" , if you start project , within say month , , how much data do you have to work with .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you wanna you wanna fr freeze your data for awhile", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we don't have the transcripts back yet from ibm", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do , do we now ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we don't even have it for this , forty - five minutes , that was", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , not complaining , was just trying to think , , what kinds of projects can you do now versus six months from now", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they 're pretty different , because", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so was thinking now it 's this exploratory where you look at the data , you use some primitive measures and get feeling for what the scatter plots look like ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and and and meanwhile we collect , and it 's more like , three months from now , or six months from now you can you can do lot of other things .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "cuz 'm not actually , just logistically that spend", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't wanna charge the time that have on the project too early , before there 's enough data to make good use of the time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that 's and especially with the student", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this guy who seems", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "anyway , shouldn't say too much ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if someone came that was and wanted to do some real work and they have to end by the end of this school year in the spring , how much data will have to work with , with that person .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so it 's", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so would think , exploratory things now . , three months from now", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the transcriptions are bit of an unknown cuz we haven't gotten those back yet as far as the timing ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but as far as the collection , it doesn't seem to me like , , unreasonable to say that in january , , ro roughly which is roughly three months from now , we should have at least something like , , twenty - five , thirty hours .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and we just about the transcription part of that ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we need to that there 's possibility that the transcript will need to be adjusted afterwards ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and es especially since these people won't be used to dealing with multi - channel transcriptions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that we 'll need to adjust some", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and also if we wanna add things like , , more refined coding of overlaps , then definitely we should count on having an extra pass through .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wanted to ask another aspect of the data collection .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there 'd be no reason why person couldn't get together several , , friends ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and come and argue about topic if they wanted to ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if they really have something they wanna talk about as opposed to something @ @", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "what we 're trying to stay away from was artificial constructions ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but if it 's real", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "'m thinking , politically", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "stage some political debates .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "you could do this ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or just if you 're if you ha if there are meetings here that happen that we can record even if we don't have them do the digits , or have them do shorter digit thing like if it was , , , one string of digits , , they 'd probably be willing to do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we don't have to do the digits if we don't want to .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "then , having the data is very valuable ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "cuz it 's politically better for us to say we have this many hours of audio data , especially with the itr , if we put in proposal on it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 'll just look like icsi 's collected lot more audio data .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "whether it 's transcribed or not , is another issue ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but there 's there are research questions you can answer without the transcriptions , or at least that you can start to answer .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it seems like you could hold some meetings .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you and adam ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you you could hold some additional meetings , if you wanted .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we 're already talking about two levels of detail in meetings .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one is without doing the digits or , the full - blown one is where you do the digits , and everything , and then talk about doing it without digits ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what if we had another level , just to collect data , which is without the headsets and we just did the table - mounted .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "need the close - talking mikes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you do , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it seems like it 's big part of this corpus is to have the close - talking mikes .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "or at least , like , me personally ? would couldn't use that data .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and mari also ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we had this came up when she was here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's important .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it 's idea ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "by the , don't think the transcriptions are actually , in the long run , such big bottleneck .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and if it were true than would just do that ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it 's not that bad", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like the room is not the bottleneck ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we have enough time in the room ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's getting the people to come in and put on the and get the setup going .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the issue is just that we 're we 're blazing that path .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and and do you have any idea when the you 'll be able to send the ten hours to them ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "'ve been burning two ds day , which is about all do with the time have .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so it 'll be early next week .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so early next week we send it to them ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then we check with them to see if they 've got it", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and we start , asking about the timing for it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so once they get it sorted out about how they 're gonna do it , which they 're pretty along on ,

"that 's probably true .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so it 's the amount of", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's it 's just getting it going .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's pipeline , pipeline issues .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "what about these lunch meetings", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "once the pipeline fills .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": ", if there 's any way without too much more
