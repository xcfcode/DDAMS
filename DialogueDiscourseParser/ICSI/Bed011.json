natural language understanding thing is , we think gonna only have to choose parameters , but , fairly large set of parameters .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so to do that , we need to do two things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one of which is figure out wh the choices are , which we 've done fair amount .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then we need to figure out what influences its choices",

"speaker": "C"}, {"text": "isn't this wonderful ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we get to the belief - net just focusing on the go - there node .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "analogously this would be the reason node and the timing node and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and what what happened is that design - wise 'd noticed that we can we still get lot of errors from lot of points to one of these sub go - there user go - there situation nodes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so came up with couple of additional nodes here where", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "whether the user is thrifty or not , and what his budget is currently like , is going to result in some financial state of the user .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how much will he is he willing to spend ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or can spend .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "being the same at this just the money available , which may influence us , whether he wants to go there", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it is charging tons of dollars for admission or its gonna cost lot of", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "twenty - two million to fly to international space station , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just not all people can do that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , and this actually turned out to be pretty key , because having specified these this intermediate level and noticing that everything that happens here", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let 's go to our favorite endpoint one", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is again more or less we have", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then the situation nodes contributing to the endpoint situation node , which contributes to the endpoint and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now draw straight lines from these to here , meaning it goes where the sub -", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "everything that comes from situation , everything that comes from user goes with the sub - ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and whatever we specify for the so - called \" keith node \" , or the discourse , what comes from the parser , construction parser , will contribute to the and the ontology to the sub - node .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and one just has to watch which also final decision node so it doesn't make sense to figure out whether he wants to enter , view or approach an object if he never wants to go there in the first place .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but this makes the design thing fairly simple .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and now all that 's left to do then is the cpg 's , the conditional probabilities , for the likelihood of person having enough money , actually wanting to go place if it costs , this or that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and once bhaskara has finished his classwork that 's where we 're gonna end up doing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you get involved in that process too .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and and for now the question is \" how much of these decisions do we want to build in explicitly into our data collection

that we ought to decide , what things are are actually going to matter to us .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , so the zoo , and the university and the castle , et cetera . are all big - ish things that have different parts to them , and one of them might be fine .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the the reason why we did it that way , as as reminder , is no person is gonna do all of them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they 're just gonna select , according to their preferences .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "\" , , usually visit zoos , or usually visit castles , or usually \"", "speaker":

"they 're redundant .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "to build system that had the most data on relatively confined set of things , you do something else .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the speech people , , are gonna do better if they if things come up repeatedly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now , , if everybody says exactly the same thing then it 's not interesting .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , all 'm saying is there 's there 's question of what we 're trying to accomplish .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and my temptation for the data gathering would be to ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and each person is only gonna do it once ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you don't have to worry about them being bored ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if it 's one service , one luxury item , , one big - ish place , and and so on , then my is that the data is going to be easier to handle .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now you have this possible danger that somehow there 're certain constructions that people use when talking about museum that they wouldn't talk about with university and ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but 'm my temptation is to go for simpler .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but what other people think about this in terms of", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so don't exactly understand", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like we 're trying to limit the detail of our

"lots of pronunciations of of the same thing are going to give you better data than , few pronunciations of lots more things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we would rather just ask have bunch of people talk about the zoo ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and assume that will that the constructions that they use there will give us everything we need to know about these zoo , castle , whatever type things , these bigger places .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "thi this is question for", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that way you get the speech data of people saying \" zoo \" over and over again or whatever too .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is question for you ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , , if we if we do , and we probably will ,

different activities .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but got the point and like it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can do put them in more hierarchical fashion .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , \" go to place \" and then give them choice ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "either they 're the symphony type or opera type or the tourist site guide type or the nightclub disco type person and they say

the other day \" thing ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so . my question is", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to some extent , we should we just have to try it out and see if it works .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it would be challenging , in sense , to try to make it so complex that they even really should schedule , or to plan it , , more complex thing in terms of", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they
