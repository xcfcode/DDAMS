what you it 's hard to tell on neural net is what 's going on internally .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it 's actually not that hard to analyse it and figure out the effects of different inputs ,

if", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then decision tree is really good ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but here he 's he 's not like he has one , bunch of very distinct variables , like pitch and this he 's talking about , like , all these cepstral coefficients , and ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in which case any reasonable classifier is gonna be mess , and it 's gonna be hard to figure out what", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "will include too the the differential de derivates too .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the other thing that one , this is , good thing to do , to look at these things at least", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "see what 'd let me tell you what would do .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would take just few features . instead of taking all the mfcc 's , or all the plp 's or

examples and look at scatter plots .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so before you do build up any fancy classifiers , just take look in two dimensions , at how these things are split apart .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that will give you lot of insight of what is likely to be useful feature when you put it into more complicated classifier .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the second thing is , once you actually get to the point of building these classifiers , @ @ what this lacks so far is the temporal properties .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if you 're just looking at frame and time , you anything about , , the structure of it over time , and so you may wanna build @ @ build markov model of some sort , or else have features that really are based on on some bigger chunk of time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but this is good place to start .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but don't anyway , this is my suggestion , is don't just , , throw in twenty features at it , the deltas , and the delta del and all that into some classifier , even if it 's - nearest - neighbors , you still won't know", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what it 's doing , even it 's", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to it 's to have better feeling for what it 's", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "look at som some picture that shows you , \" here 's these things , are offer some separation . \" and , , in lpc , , the thing to particularly look at is , is something like , , the residual", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it strikes me that there 's another piece of information , that might be useful and that 's simply the transition .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , if you go from transition of silence to overlap versus transition from silence to speech , there 's gonna be big informative area there , it

several objective", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because it 's project .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , at the first , in the acoustic , , parts of the project , you we have two main objective .",

{"text": "but understand that you your objective is to classify , to know that that zone not is only new zone in the in the file , that you have , but you have to to know that this is overlap zone .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because in the future you will try to process that zone with non - regular speech recognizer model , suppose .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you will pretend to process the

things you 've written up there are way too way too big .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "? if you 're talking about , say , twelfth - order mfcc 's like that it 's just way too much .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you won't be able to look at it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "all you 'll be able to do is put it into classifier and see how it does .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "whereas if you have things if you pick one or two dimensional things , or three of you have some very fancy display , , and look at how the different classes separate themselves out , you 'll have much more insight about what 's going on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it will be enough .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you 'll you 'll get feeling for what 's happening , ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if you look at suppose you look at first and second - order cepstral coefficients for some one of these kinds of things and you find that the first - order is much more effective than the second , and then you look at the third and there 's not and not too much there , you may just take first and second - order cepstral coefficients ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and with lpc , lpc per se isn't gonna tell you much more than than the other , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and on the other hand , the lpc residual , the energy in the lpc residual , will say how , the low - order lpc model 's fitting it , which should be pretty poorly for two or more people speaking at the same time , and it should be pretty , for for one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so again , if you take few of these things that are prob promising features and look at them in pairs , , you 'll have much more of sense of \" , now have , doing bunch of these analyses ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now have ten likely candidates . \"", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then you can do decision trees or whatever to see how they combine .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'ve got question .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , it is the first way to do that", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and would like to , your opinion .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "all this study in the in the first moment , will pretend to do with equalizes speech . the the equalizes speech , the speech , the mixes of speech .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the mix , mixed speech .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "\" mixed \" . .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because the spectral distortion is more lot clearer , very much clearer if we compare with the pda .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "pda speech file is it will be difficult .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it 's messier .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the the pda is messier .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "fff ! because the the noise to sp the signal - to - noise relation is is low .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's good way to start .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that the result of the of the study with with this this speech , the mix speech will work exactly with the pda files .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it would be interesting in itself to see .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would be an interesting result .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what , , what is the effect of the low ' signal to to noise relation , , with", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's not it 's not unreasonable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it makes sense to start with the simpler signal", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because if you have features which don't aren't even helpful in the high signal - to - noise ratio , then there 's no point in putting them into the low signal ratio , one would think , anyway .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so , if you can get @ @ again , my prescription would be that you would , with mixed signal , you would take collection of possible , features look at them , look at how these different classes that you 've marked , separate themselves , and then collect , in pairs , and then collect ten of them , and then proceed with bigger classifier .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then if you can get that to work , then you go to the other signal .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then , and , they won't work as , but how , how much", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then you can re - optimize , and so on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it it would be interesting to try couple with both .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because it it would be interesting to see if some features work with close mixed , and and don't", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's , the it it 's true that it also , it could be useful to do this exploratory analysis

.", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but what is the the relation of of the performance when you use the , speech file the pda speech files .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it it will be important .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because people , different groups has experience with this problem . is is not easy to solve , because if you", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have seen the the speech file from

very difficult to apply , parameter to detect change when you don't see .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that that 's another reason why very simple features , things like energy , and things like

"will put the energy here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ch - chuck was gonna ask something .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you have question .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is dumb question ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it would be it would be easier if you used pda", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because can't you , couldn't you like use beam - forming to detect speaker overlaps ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you used the array , rather than the signal from just one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , you 're you 're", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that , if we made use of the fact that there are two microphones , you do have some location information . which we don't have with the one", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so that 's", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is that not allowed with this project ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", no , , we don't have any rules , really .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but didn't mean given given the goal .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's it 's it 's an additional interesting question .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is that violation of the", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you wanna know whether you can do it with one ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because it 's not necessarily true that every device that you 're trying to do this with will have two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if , on the other hand , we show that there 's huge advantage with two , then that could be real point .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , we don't even know yet what the effect of detecting having the ability to detect overlaps is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it doesn't matter too much .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , this is all pretty early stages .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but no , you 're .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's good thing to consider .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there there is complication though , and that is if person turns their back to the to the pda , then some of the positional information goes away ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it it does , it it does , but the the issue is that", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , it 's not it 's not that so much as", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then , and if they 're on the access on the axis of it , that was the other thing was thinking .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "he you mentioned this last time , that if you 're straight down the midline , then the the left - 's gonna be different ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we hav need to put it on little turntable ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and and in his case , , he 's closer to it anyway .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it seems to me that it 's not , , it 's this the topograph the topology of it is little bit complicated .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but it 's another source of information .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because the distance between the two microph , microphone , , in the pda is very near .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it 's from my opinion , it 's an interesting idea to try to study the binaural problem , with information , because found difference between the speech from each micro , in the pda .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's timing difference .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it - it 's not amplitude ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "! agree ! and we use it ourselves .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "know that 's very important cue .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but 'm just 'm just saying that the way we 're seated around table , is not the same with respect to each to each person with respect to the pda ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we 're gonna have lot of differences with ref respect to the speaker .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's that 's fine .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but don't think that matters , though .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's so so @ @ the issue is , \" is there clean signal coming from only one direction ? \"", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it 's not coming from just one direction , if it if if there 's broader pattern , it means that it 's more likely there 's multiple people speaking ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "wherever they are .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it 's like how confused is it about where the beam is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it is it", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is there narrow is there narrow beam

"wherever you are , even if he moves around .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", it just it just seemed to me that , that this isn't the ideal type of separation .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's see the value", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "ideal would be to have the wall filled with them ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but but just having two mikes if you looked at that thing on dan 's page , it was when when there were two people speaking , and it looked really different .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what looked different ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", basic he was looking at correlation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "cross - co cross - correlation .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just cross - correlation between two sides .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "did - , 'm not what dan 's page is that you mean . he was looking at the two", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so cross - correlation is pretty sensitive .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "his web page .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you take the signal from the two microphones and you cros and you cross - correlate them with different lags .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and you find they get peaks .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so when one person is speaking , then wherever they happen to be at the point when they 're speaking , then there 's pretty big maximum around that point in the in the lag .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if at whatever angle you are , at some lag corresponding to the time difference between the two there , you get this boost in the in the cross - correlation value function .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so so if there 's two", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if there are multiple people talking , you 'll see two peaks .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's spread out .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let me ask you , if both people were over there , it would be less effective than if one was there and one was across , catty - corner ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the - the , 'm ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if they 're next to one another ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if was if was here and morgan was there and we were both talking , it wouldn't work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "next next one over over on this side of the pda .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "good example , the same one 'm asking .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "versus you versus , and we 're catty - corner across the table , and 'm farther away from this one and you 're farther away from that one .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "or or even if , like , if people were sitting across from each other , you couldn't tell the difference either .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it seems like that would be pretty strong .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "across the same axis , you don't have as much to differentiate .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we , we don't have third dimension there . , so it 's", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so my point was just that it 's it 's gonna be differentially varia valuable .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's not to say , certainly 's extremely val and we humans depend on , these binaural cues .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but it 's almost but it 's almost what you 're talking about there 's two things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "must do . .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there 's sensitivity issue , and then there 's pathological error issue .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the one where someone is just directly in line is pathological error .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if someone just happens to be sitting there then we won't get good information from it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and and if there so it and if it 's the two of you on the same side", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if they 're if they 're close , it 's just question of the sensitivity .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if the sensitivity is good enough and we just we just don't have enough , , experience with it to know how", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'m not 'm not trying to argue against using it , by any means . wanted to point out that weakness , that it 's topo topologically impossible to get it perfect for everybody .", "speaker":

"speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the other thing you can do , if , we 're assuming that it would be big deal just to get somebody convince somebody to put two microphones in the pda .", "speaker": "D"},
