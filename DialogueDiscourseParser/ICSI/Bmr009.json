"actually , you do have some distributions here , for these cases .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have some histograms ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , they don't look very separate .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is the first derivate of log of frame energy without any normalization .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "these the these are the first experiments with comment",

so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what is , even if you use linear , , raw measures , like raw energy or whatever ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we shouldn't make any assumptions about the

in derivatives , but not in the", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but he but he doesn't doesn't", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , we what they look like on the , tsk for the raw .", "speaker": "D"},

{"text": "so she 's .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it 's the the following .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it might be just good to it looks like .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's that 's cuz 'd mentioned scatter plots before but she 's ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "even before you get the scatter plots , just looking at single feature , looking at the distribution , is good thing to do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "catal - combining the different possibilities of the parameters .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the the scatter plot combining different two combination .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but what she 's saying is , which is , is le", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "combination of two , of energy and derivate", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "let 's start with the", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "before we get complicated , let 's start with the most basic wh thing , which is we 're arguing that if you take energy if you look at the energy , that , when two people are speaking at the same time , usually there 'll be more energy than when one is", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's that hypothesis .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the first way you 'd look at that , she 's , , ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is that you would just take look at the distribution of those two things ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "much as you 've plotted them here ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but just but just do it", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in this case you have three .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have the silence , and that 's fine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , with three colors or three shades or whatever ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just look at those distributions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then , given that as base , you can see if that gets improved , , or or worsened by the looking at regular energy , looking at log energy ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we were just proposing that it 's , it 's harder to see with the log energy ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also these different normalizations , does particular choice of normalization make it better ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but had made it too complicated by suggesting early on , that you look at scatter plots", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because that 's looking at distribution in two dimensions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let 's start off just in one , , with this feature .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's probably the most basic thing , before anything very complicated .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then we we 're that pitch - related things are are going to be really likely candidate to help .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but since your intuition from looking at some of the data , is that when you looked at the regular energy , that it did usually go up , when two people were talking , that 's , you should be able to come up with measure which will match your intuition .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and she 's , that that having having this table , with whole bunch of things , with the standard deviation , the variance and , it 's it 's harder to interpret than just looking at the same picture you have here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it it 's curious but found it in the in the mixed file , in one channel that in several several times you have an speaker talking alone with high level of energy", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "in the middle zone of overlapping with mmm less energy", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and come with another speaker with high energy", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and the overlapping zone has less energy .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so there 'll be some cases for which", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because there reach very many", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but , the qu so they 'll be", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is want to point to visual things ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but they there 'll be time there 'll be overlap between the distributions ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the question is , \" if it 's reasonable feature , there 's some separation . \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so . locally .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just locally , .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and was just going to say that now we 're just exploring .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the other thing is", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what you would imagine eventually , is that you 'll feed all of these features into some discriminative system .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so even if one of the features does good job at one type of overlap , another feature might do good job at another type of overlap .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the reason had suggested the scatter features is used to do this lot , when we had thirteen or fifteen or twenty features to look at .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because something is good feature by itself , you don't really know how it 'll behave in combination", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so it 's to have as many as many together at the same time as possible in in some reasonable visual form .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 's graphic things people have had sometimes to put together three or four in some funny way .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it 's true that you shouldn't do any of that unless that the individual ones , at least , have some some hope", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "especially for normalizing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's really important to pick normalization that matches the distribution for that feature .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it may not be the same for all the types of overlaps or the windows may not be the same .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "actually , was wondering , now you 're taking all of the speech , from the whole meeting , and you 're trying to find points of overlap ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we don't really know which speaker is overlapping with which speaker ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so another way would just be to take the speech from just , say , morgan , and just jane and then just their overlaps ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like but by hand ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and looking at , if you can detect something that way ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because if we can't do it that way , there 's no good way that we 're going to be able to do it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that , there might be something helpful and cleaner about looking at just individuals and then that combination alone .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "plus , it has more elegant", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the the model will be easier to see that way .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if , if you go through and you find adam , cuz he has lot of overlaps and some other speaker who also has enough speech", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and just look at those three cases of adam and the other person and the overlaps ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and just look at the distributions , there is clear pattern", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we just can't see it because there 's too many combinations of people that can overlap .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "had the same intuition last last week .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just seems complex .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's to start with it 's your idea of simplifying ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "starting with something that you can see without the extra layers of", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "cuz if energy doesn't matter there , like", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't think this is true , but what if", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to study individual ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "to study individual ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you you don't have to study everybody individually", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to study the simplest case to get rid of extra", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the the but consider", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but just simple case", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the one that has the lot of data associated with it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "cuz what if it 's the case and don't think this is true", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that was overlap .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what if it 's the case that when two people overlap they equate their , there 's conservation of energy and everybody", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "both people talk more softly ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't think this happens .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or or what if the equipment what if the equipment adjusts somehow ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or they get louder .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there 's some equalizing in there ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no we don't have that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but but that 's what was saying about different types of overlap .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there are there are different types ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and within those types ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like as jose was saying , that sounded like backchannel overlap ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "meaning the kind that 's friendly encouragement , like \" - . \" ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "\" ! \" ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it doesn't take you don't take the floor .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , some of those , as you showed , can be discriminated by the duration of the overlap .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it actually the new student , don , who adam has met , and he was at one of our meetings", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "he 's getting his feet wet and then he 'll be starting again in mid - january .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "he 's interested in trying to distinguish the types of overlap .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if he 's talked with you yet .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but in honing in on these different types", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't consi now don't consider that possibility .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "this is general studio of the overlapping we 're studying the", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "would actually still recommend that he do the overall thing", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it might be something that we can help by categorizing some of them and then , , look at that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because it would be the quickest thing for him to do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "he could you see , he already has all his in place ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "he has the histogram mechanism ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "he has the that subtracts out", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and all he has to do is change it from log to plain energy and plot the histogram and look at it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then he should go on and do the other bec", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but but this will", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no . didn't mean that for you to do that ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but was thinking if don and are trying to get categories", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we label some data for you , and we say this is what we going", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you don't have to worry about it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and here 's the three types of overlaps .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we 'll we 'll do the labelling for you .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "consider different class of overlap ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that we would be working on anyway .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if there 's time .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "then you can try some different things for those three cases , and see if that helps , or", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is the thing comment with you before , that we have variation of situation of overlapping .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and the behavior for energy is , log energy , is not the same all the time .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but was just saying that now from the means that you gave , don't have any sense of whether even , , there are any significant number of cases for which there is distinct", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and would imagine there should be some , there should be the distributions should be somewhat separated .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and would still that if they are not separated , that there 's some there 's most likely something wrong in the way that we 're measuring it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , wouldn't expect that it was very common overall , that when two people were talking at the same time , that it would that it really was lower ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "although sometimes , as you say , it would .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so . so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , that was that was jok", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or , case where you would never know that unless you actually go and look at two individuals .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it could it probably does happen sometimes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "mind if turned that light off ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the flickering is annoying me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it might the case , though , that the significant energy , just as jose was saying , comes in the non - backchannel cases .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because in back most people when they 're talking don't change their own energy when they get backchannel ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "cuz they 're not really predicting the backchannel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and sometimes it 's nod and sometimes it 's an \" - \" .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the \" - \" is really usually very low energy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so those don't actually have much difference in energy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but all the other cases might .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what they what difference there was would be lost in taking the log ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the backchannels are easy to spot in terms of their words or", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just listen to it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it would be lost no matter what you do .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "mmm , no ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it 's if if it 's", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it won't be as big .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "even if you take the log , you can your model just has more sensitive measures .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but tone might be very", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you 're \" - \" tone is going to be very different .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you could imagine doing specialized ones for different types of backchannels , if you could if you had good model for it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "your \" - \" detector .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if if you 're my point is , if you 're doing essentially linear separation , taking the log first does make it harder to separate .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it 's so , if you so if there if there close to things it does", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's nonlinear operation that does change the distinction .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you 're doing non if you 're doing some fancy thing then", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and now we 're essentially doing this linear thing by looking across here and saying we 're going to cut it here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that 's the indicator that we 're getting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but anyway , , we 're not disagreeing on any of this ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should look at it more more finely , but that this often happens , you do fairly complicated things , and then you stand back from them and you realize that you haven't done something simple .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , if you generated something like that just for the energy and see , and then , as liz says , when they have smaller , more coherent groups to look at , that would be another interesting thing later .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then that should give us some indication between those , should give us some indication of whether there 's anything to be achieved from energy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then you can move on to the more {nonvocalsound} pitch related .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is good idea .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "not consider the log energy .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "have you started looking at the pitch related ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "harmonicity and so on ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'m preparing the program but don't don't begin because saw your email", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and agree with you it 's better to suppose it 's better to consider the energy this parameter bef", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's not what .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we certainly should see this but that the harm", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "certainly wasn't saying this was better than the harmonicity and pitch related things", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "go on with the with the pitch ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "understood that had to finish by the moment with the and concentrate my energy in that problem .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but , like , all these derivatives and second derivatives and all these other very fancy things ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would just look at the energy and then get into the harmonicity as suggestion .", "speaker":

"speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and did you have some ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wanted to ask just something on the end of this top topic .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , when presented my results about the distribution of overlaps and the speakers and the profiles of the speakers , at the bottom of that did have proposal ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and had plan to go through with it , of co coding the types of overlaps that people were involved in just with reference to speaker style so , , with reference", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and said that on my in my summary ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 'd be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that so it 's like people may have different amounts of being overlapped with or overlapping", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that in itself is not

{"text": "that would be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , but it it 's like it sounds like you also have something in that direction .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would be really .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", we got his environment set up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "he 's he 's double - .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so . it 's mostly that , if we had to label it ourselves ,

'll be bad .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it 's also the case that this multi - wave thing is proposed to the", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so . dan proposed it to the transcriber central people

's true , too .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is useful thing for us .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so . you mean they could they could do it and it would be fast enough if they do it ?",
