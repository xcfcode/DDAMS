to at spend at least part of the time trying to build the influence links ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which sets of things are relevant to which decisions", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and actually had specific suggestion to start first with the path ones .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the database ones being in some sense less interesting to us", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "although probably have to be done", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so to do that", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so there 's and the idea was we were gonna do two things", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is your mike on ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we were gonna do two things", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one of which is just lay out the influence structure of what we nfluences what", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's funny .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then as separate but related task", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "particularly bhaskara and were going to try to decide what kinds of belief nodes are needed in order to do what we what we need to do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so but du we should have all of the basic design of what influences what done before we decide exactly how to compute it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so didn't did you get chance to look yet ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "looked at some of that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so let 's start with the belief - nets , the general influence", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then we 'll then we 'll also at some point break and talk about the techy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one could go there 's", "speaker": "E"},

.", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "is this true or false", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "or we 'll get", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "\" go there \" .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so there is this question

that decision would be do we want that", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you could two different things you could do ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you could have all those values for go - there",

more film eventually from their utterance", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it 's much more complex to query when would be the most appropriate time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so 've tried to come up with some initial things one could observe", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so who is the user ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "everything that has user comes from the user model", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "everything that has situation comes from the situation model - .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we should be clear .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but when it comes to writing down", "speaker":

{"text": "you 've have you seen this before keith , these belief - net things ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but 'm following it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so here is the we had that the user 's budget may influence the outcome of decisions .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "there we wanted to keep running total of things .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "is this like number that represents how much money they have left to spend ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how is it different from user finance ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the finance is here thought of as the financial policy person carries

.", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there it is .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so keith what 's behind this is actually program that will once you fill all this in actually solve your belief - nets for you and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is not just display ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is actually gui to simulator that will if we tell it all the things we 'll wind up with functioning belief - net at the other end .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it 's so simple even use it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that is simple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "think of people being cheap , average , or spendy or we can even have finer scale moderately cheap ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but here wasn't what to write in .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you 've written in you 've written

here 's what 's permissible", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that you can arrange so that the the value of that is gonna have to be updated", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it 's not belief update ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's you took some actions , you spent money and ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the update of that is gonna have to be essentially external to the belief - net .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then what you 're going to need is for the things that it influences .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let 's first of all let 's see if it does influence anything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if it does influence anything then you 're gonna need something that converts from the number here to something that 's relevant to the decision there .", "speaker":

conditioned externally and might influence various things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let 's forget it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's fine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "anyway , go ahead .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so this , that", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the other thing is that every time that 's updated beliefs will have to be propagated", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but then the question is do you do we wanna propagate beliefs every single time it 's updated or only when we need to ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's good question .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and does it have lazy mode ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", in srini 's thing there was this thing there was this option like proper inferences which suggests that doesn't happen , automatically .",

"let 's do the first one let 's do the one that we already think we did", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that was the of the endpoint ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it 's true or false ?",

{"text": "mode of transportation ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "also true or false .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , he has he hasn't filled them in yet , is what 's true .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "did or didn't ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "probably nothing done yet ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "did it on the upper ones , .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so this was eva .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we can think of more things ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "climb , rob .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "these are ju that 's just point ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "some of those are subsumed by approach .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would it be an endpoint if you were crossing over it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the charles bridge , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would be for given segment .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you you go first go the town square", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , , if you go to re if you go to prague or whatever one of your key points that you have to do is cross the charles bridge", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and doesn't really matter which way you cross", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which where you end up at the end", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the part the good part is walking over it ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's subtle , but true .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so let 's just leave it three with three for now", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and let 's see if we can get it linked up just to get ourselves started .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you 'll see it you 'll see something comes up immediately , that the reason wanna do this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the user was definitely more likely to enter if he 's local", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "more likely to view if he 's tourist", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then we had the fact that given the fact that he 's thrifty and there will be admission then we get all these cross", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we did , but the three things that it contributed to this", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the other two aren't up there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so one was the ontology", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we 'll what type of building is it ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and the and the third thing we talked about was something from the discourse .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what he has mentioned before .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so what what we seem to need here ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is why it starts getting into the technical", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the way we had been designing this , there were three intermediate nodes", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which were the endpoint decision as seen from the user model as seen from the ontology and as seen from the discourse .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so each of those", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the way we had it designed ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now we can change the design ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the design we had was", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there was decision with the same three outcomes based on the those three separate considerations", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if we wanted to do that would have to put in three intermediate nodes", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can load it up it very simple .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then what you and have to talk about is , if we 're doing that and they get combined somehow how do they get combined ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the they 're undoubtedly gonna be more things to worry about .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this was adjusted for this one mode thing .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so that 's in our in johno 's pictogram everything that could contribute to whether person wants to enter , view , or approach something .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it was called mode ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is mode here means the same as endpoint .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is now this endpoint .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "why don't we ch can we change that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can just rename that , .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but that was actually ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "unfortunately that was an intermediate versio", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's don't think what we would currently do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can ask about \" slurred \" and \" angry \" as inputs to this ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like they 're either true or false", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if the if the person talking is angry or slurs their speech they might be tired or ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , , possibly", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "less likely to enter .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was thinking less likely to view", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that 's - that seems to ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so so my advice to do is get this down to what we actually likely to be strong influence .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , that was what he had in mind .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so let 's think about this question of how do we wanna handle", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so there 're two separate things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "at least two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one is how do we want to handle the notion of the ontology", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now what we talked about , and this is another technical thing bhaskara , is can we arrange so that", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that the belief - net itself has properties", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the properties are filled in from on ontology items .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the let 's take the case of the this endpoint thing ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the notion was that if you had few key properties like is this tourist site , some landmark", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it place of business", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it something you physically could enter", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that there 'd be certain properties that would fit into the decision node", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then again as part of the ou outer controlling conditioning of this thing those would be set ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that some somehow someone would find this word , look it up in the ontology , pull out these properties , put it into the belief - net , and then the decision would flow .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "seems to me that we 've embedded lot , embedded lot of these things we had in there previously in in some of the other final decisions done here ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if we would know that this thing is exhibiting something", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if it 's exhibiting itself it is landmark ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "meaning more likely to be viewed", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if it is exhibiting pictures or sculptures and like this , then it 's more likely to be entered .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's that 's completely", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that 's good ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what that says is that we might be able to take and", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the ones we talked about were exhibiting and selling", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , accessibility meant", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it 's closed one probably won't enter .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "or if it 's not accessible to tourist ever the likelihood of that person actually wanting to enter it ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "given that he knows it , .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so let me suggest this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "could you move those up about halfway .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the ones that you and selling .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it 's fixing things selling things , or servicing things", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so here 's what it looks like to me .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that you want an intermediate structure which is essentially the or of for this purpose of selling , fixing , or servicing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that is , for certain purposes , it becomes important", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but for this purpose one of these places is quite like the other .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "does that seem ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you 're just merging those for just the sake of endpoint decision ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if it may be more than endpoint decisions ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the idea would be that you might wanna merge those three", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ser selling , fixing , and servicing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what ex and so either those is true or false ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it here 's where it gets little tricky .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "from the belief - net point of view it is", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "from another point of view it 's interest it 's it 's important to it 's selling or servicing and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so for this decision it 's just true or false", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and in this is case where the or seems just what you want .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that that if any of those things is true then it 's the place that you", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "more likely to enter .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "are more likely to enter .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you just wanna have them all pointing to summary thing ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you could , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so let 's do that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no no , no to an inter no , an intermediate node .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's the part of the idea , is", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that the object type node ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so are they the is it the object that sells , fixes , or services things ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "open up object type and let 's see what its values are .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "created it , it has none so far .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "first of all it 's not objects ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we called them entities ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then we have the", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "let 's say put commercial .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "commercial action inside where people", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "couldn't do let 's do commercial", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and where was the accessible , .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "cuz that 's tempor that varies temporally ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what would hotel fall under ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would call that service ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in terms of entity type ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "say it 's co would", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "again for this purpose it 's commercial .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "someplace you want to go in to do some business .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what does the underscore - at the end of each of those things signify ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so places that service things sell things or fix things and pe places that exhibit things .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that also points to entity type .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we 're deriving this the this feature of whether the main action at this place happens inside or outside or what we 're deriving that from what activity is done there ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "couldn't you have it as just primitive feature of the entity ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's that 's choice .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it seems like that 's much more reliable", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "cuz you could have outdoor places that sell things", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and indoor places that do something else", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the problem with it is that it putting in feature just for one decision ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now we may wind up having to do that", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this anyway , this", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "at mental level that 's what we 're gonna have to sort out .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , what does this look like ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what are what are intermediate things that are worth computing ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what are the features we need in order to make all these decisions", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and what 's the best way to organize this so that it 's clean and consistent and all that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'m just thinking about how people , human beings who know about places and places to go and so on would store this", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it would probably you wouldn't just remember that they sell and then deduce from that it must be going on inside .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "an entity should be regard as vector of several possible things ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it can either do do sell things , fix things , service things , exhibit things , it can be landmark at the same time as doing these things ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's not either or", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "mmm certainly place can be hotel and famous site .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "many come to mind .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "things can be generally landmark and be accessible .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "or can be landmark or not accessible , some statue", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "can go inside .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "anyway so let me suggest you do something else .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is to get rid get rid of that long link between who the user and the endpoint .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "could we just move it like this ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "no no , don't want the link there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because what we 're gonna want is an intermediate thing", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is the endpoint decisi the endpoint decision based on the user models ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what we what we talked about is three separate endpoint decisions ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so let 's make new node", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just as suggestion you could \" save as \" to keep your old one and clean", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so you can mess with this one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the old one was not that important ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": ", not big deal then .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let 's do it then .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "isn't there \" save as \" inside of java base ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but just take this", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "copy it somewhere else .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "this was user something", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "let 's put it this let 's do endpoint underbar - .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "endpoint , end poi", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's the endpoint", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let 's say underbar - ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that 's the endpoint decision as seen through the", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as related from the user model .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so let 's let 's actually", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so lin you can link that up to the", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "should rename this too ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so that , that 's endpoint", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's underscore - .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "underscore - for entity ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we may change all this ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "shouldn't be able to move them all ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "actually , the easiest thing would move mo move the endpoint ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just do whatever .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wasn't this possible ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you have to be in move mode before", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so now we 're looking for user related things that", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and it 's just one who is the user ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there 's more .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if he 's usi if he 's in car now", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "people with harry drove the car into the cafe", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "anyway , this is crude .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now but the now so but then the question is", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so and we assume that some of these properties would come indirectly through an ontology ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but then we had this third idea of input from the discourse .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let 's should we finish this ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but surely the user interests", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the user thrift ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the user budget .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but what we 're gonna wanna do is actually", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "here this was one of my problems", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we have the user interest is is vector of five hundred values ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's from the user model ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you mean level of interest ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no not levels of interest", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but things you can be interested in .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "somebody else has built this user model .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "gothic churches versus baroque townhouses versus", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so why is it", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it , so it 's like vector of five hundred one 's or zero 's ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yea - is that", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "like for each thing are we are you interested in it or not ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you cou and so here let me give you two ways to handle that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one is you could ignore it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the other thing you could do is have an", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and this will give you the flavor of the of what", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you could have node that 's that was measure of the match between the

computed by someone else", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just as mental note", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's all .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and and should we say that this interests affects the likelihood of entering ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and also if it 's an expensive place to enter , this may also", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "\" do have time to go in and climb all the way to the top of the koelner dome or do have to \" \" time to take picture of the outside ? \"", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it seems like everything in user model affects", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's what we don't wanna do ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "cuz then we get into huge combinatorics and like that", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "cuz if the , , and if the user is tired , the user state ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it would affect ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but 't see why anything everything in the model wouldn't be", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's we can't do that ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we 're gonna have to", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but this is good discussion ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we 're gonna have to somehow figure out some way to encapsulate that", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if there 's some general notion of the relation to the time to do this to the amount of time the guy has like that is the compatibility with his current state ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that 's what you 'd have to do ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you 'd have to get it down to something which was itself relatively compact ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it could be compatibility with his current state", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which would include his money and his time and his energy", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just seems like it 'd push the problem back level .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no but , it 's more than that ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like the more you break it up", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like because if you have everything pointing to one node it 's like exponential", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "whereas if you like keep breaking it up more and more it 's not exponential anymore .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it , there are two advantages .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's tha there 's one technical one", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the other is it gets used", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we 'd be doing subgrouping ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so make it more tree like going backwards ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it there 's two advantages ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one is the technical one that you don't wind up with such big exponential cbt 's ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the other is it can be it presumably can be used for multiple decisions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that if you have this idea of the compatibility with the requirements of an action to the state of the user one could imagine that was", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not only is it sim is it cleaner to compute it separately but it could be that it 's used in multiple places .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "anyway so in general this is the design , this is really design problem .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you 've got signal , set of decisions", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how do we do this ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what do have under user state anyhow", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "cuz named that already something .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's tired , fresh ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "should be renamed into physical state .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "or fat user fatigue even .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's with \" \" ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "then we can make user state .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "what 's what we 're talking about is compatibility .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's hard for me to imagine how everything wouldn't just contribute to user state again .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or user compatibility .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that we we had some things that", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the user interests and the user who who the user is are completely apart from the fact whether he is tired broke", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but other though the node we 're creating now is user compatibility to the current action ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "seems like everything in the user model would contribute to whether or not the user was compatible with something .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the that 's the issue is", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would even if it was true in some abstract general sense it might not be true in terms of the information we actually had and can make use of .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and anyway we 're gonna have to find some way to cl get this sufficiently simple to make it feasible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we look at the if we split it up again into", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if we look at the the endpoint again we said that for each of these things there are certain preconditions", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so you can only enter place if you are not too tired to do so", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and also have the money to do so if it costs something", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so if you can afford it and perform it is preconditions .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "viewing usually is cheap or free .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "is that always true ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "with the way we 're defining it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that viewing it without ent view with our definition of view it 's free", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so is approaching .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "what about the grand canyon ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , never mind .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are there are there large things that you would have to pay to get up close to", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not in the current", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no we have to enter the park .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "almost by definition paying involves entering ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ge going through some", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so let me suggest we switch to another one ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "clearly there 's more work to be done on this", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it 's gonna be more instructive to think about other decisions that we need to make in path land .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and what they 're gonna look like .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can save this one as and open up the old one ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then everything would be clean .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you could do it again .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "why , it 's worth saving this one", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but 'd 'd like to keep this one", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "cuz wanna see if we 're gonna reuse any of this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this might be", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you tell me ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so in terms of the planner what 's what 's good one to do ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "go there or not is good one .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "is very basic one .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "what makes things more likely that", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the fir see the first thing is , getting back to thing we left out of the other is the actual discourse .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so keith this is gonna get into your world", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because we 're gonna want to know , which constructions indicate various of these properties", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't yet know how to do this ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we 're gonna wind up pulling out discourse properties like we have object properties", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we what they are yet .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that the go - there decision will have node from discourse ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and why don't we just stick discourse thing up there to be as placeholder for", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we we also had discourse features for the endpoint .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and so again re that 's completely correct ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we have the user model , the situation model here ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we don't have the discourse model here yet .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "much the same way as we didn't we don't have the ontology here .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the ontology we said we would pull these various kinds of properties from the ontology like exhibiting , selling , and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so in some sense it 's it 's there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the discourse we don't have it represented yet .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this be specific for second year ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and and we probably will have something like discourse for endpoint .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but if we do it 'll have the three values .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 'll have the eva values", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we have it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for go - there , probably is true and false , let 's say .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's what we talked about .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we 're looking at the little data that we have ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so people say how do get to the castle", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and this usually means they wanna go there .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so this should push it in one direction", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "however people also sometimes say how do get there", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "in order to find out how to get there", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "without wanting to go there .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and sometimes people say where is it", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because they wanna know where it is", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but in most cases they probably", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but that doesn't change the fact that you 're you want these two values .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is some external thing that takes all the discourse", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then says here it 's either , yay , , or nay .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and they 'll be , user go - there", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that 's all ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "situation go - there ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because it 's whether it 's open or not .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that now that", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what 's the word", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the that interacts with the eva thing", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if they just wanna view it then it 's fine to go there when it 's closed", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "whereas if they want to", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that 's that 's where it starts getting to be essentially more interesting ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what bhaskara says which is completely is if that they 're only going to view it then it doesn't matter whether it 's closed or not", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in terms of , whether you wanna go there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the time of day ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it does matter though if there 's like strike or riot .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are other situational things that do matter .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's what said", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just having one situational node may not be enough", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because this that node by itself wouldn't distinguish", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it can have di various values .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we you 're it might not be enough .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", see 'm 'm thinking that any node that begins with \" go - there \" is either gonna be true or false .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that could be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "also , that node , the go - there node would just be fed by separate ones for", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there 's different things , the strikes and the", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like situation traffic and so on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the time of day .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so so now the other thing that bhaskara pointed out is what this says is that there sh should be link ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and this is where things are gonna get very messy", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "from the endpoint decision", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the they 're final re and , the very bottom endpoint decision to the go - there node .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and don't worry about layout ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then we 'll go we 'll go nuts", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could have intermediate node that just the endpoint and the go - there node fed into ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because that 's what we , that 's why this situation comes up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the go - there , actually the endpoint node could feed into the go - there", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the endpoint node ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "make that up to the go - there then", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we 'll have to do layout at some point ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but something like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now it 's gonna be important not to have loops .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "really important in the belief worl net world not to have loops", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how long does it take you to compute", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "no it 's much worse than that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it if loo it it 's not def it 's not defined if you 're there are loops ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it things don't converge , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you just you have to", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there are all sorts of ways of breaking it up so that there isn't", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but this isn't , this is this line is just coming from over here .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "no it 's not loop yet , 'm just saying we , in no , in", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the good thing is we could have loopy belief propagation which we all love .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so anyway , so that 's another decision .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what 's what 's another decision you like ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "these have no parents yet , but that doesn't matter .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the idea is that you go there , you go comes from something about the user from something about the situation and the the discourse is mystery .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this comes from traffic and , .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "sh - should we just make some", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if you want .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if there 's parking", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and if he has seen it already or not and ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and discourse is something that", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "should we make keith note here ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that comes from keith .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "just so we don't forget .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "have to get used to this .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then also the discourse endpoint ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "endpoint sub - is if you wanna make it consistent .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "actually is this the way to have it", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "where go there from the user and go there from the situation just about each other but they both feed the go there decision", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because isn't the ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that still allows for the possibility of the of the user model affecting our decision about whether strike is the thing which is going to keep this user away from", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that decision making happens at the go - there node .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you you you if you needed to do that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you needed it to do that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but was just thinking", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'m conflating that user node with possible asking of the user", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there 's strike on , does that affect whether or not you wanna go", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "good point , don't how we 're going to", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that might not come out of user model", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , , directly out of interaction .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "gu yes my curr , don't that 's enough .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my current idea on that would be that each of these decision nodes has questions associated with it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the question wouldn't itself be one of these conditional things", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "given that there 's strike do you still wanna go ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if you told him bunch of , then you would ask him do you wanna go ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but trying to formulate the conditional question , that sounds too much .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "alright , but let me let 's stay with this minute", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because want to do little bit of organization .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "before we get more into details .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the organization is going to be that", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the flavor of what 's going on is going to be that", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as we going to this detail keith is going to worry about the various constructions that people might use", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and johno has committed himself to being the parser wizard ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what 's going to happen is that eventually", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like by the time he graduates ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they 'll be some system which is able to take the discourse in context and have outputs that can feed the rest of belief - net .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wa assume everybody knows that ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wanna , get closure that 'll be the game then ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the semantics that you 'll get out of the discourse will be of values that go into the various discourse - based decision nodes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and now some of those will get fancier like mode of transportation and", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it isn't by any means necessarily simple thing that you want out .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if there is an and there is mode of transportation", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it there 's also split if you loo if you blow this up and look at it in more detail there 's something that comes from the discourse in terms of what was actually just said", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "what 's the utterance go giving us", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then what 's the discourse history give us .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that , , we 'll have to decide how much of where that goes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's two things then .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "an and it 's not clear yet .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it could be those are two separate things ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it could be that the discourse gadget itself integrates as", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which would be my", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that you 'd have to do see in order to do reference and like that you 've gotta have both the current discourse and the context to say wanna go back there ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what does that mean", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but is is this picture that 's emerging here just my wish that you have noticed already for symmetry", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "or is it that we get for each decision on the very bottom we get the sub - , sub - , sub - and sub - \" \" for \" ontology \" meta node", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but it might just", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it could be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is this is getting into the thing wanna talk about next ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is if that 's true how do we wanna combine those ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or when it 's true ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but this wou would be though that , , we only have at most four at the moment arrows going to each of the bottom decisions .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and four you we can handle .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's too much ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it see if it 's fou if it 's four things and each of them has four values it turns out to be big cpt ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's not completely impossi", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's it 's not beyond what the system could solve", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it 's probably beyond what we could actually write down . or learn .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , it 's four to the fourth .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's pretty big .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "two fifty - six ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is that what that", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's and don't 's gonna don't 'll get worse than that ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so le that 's that 's good", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but but four didn't we decide of these had true or false ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so is it 's four", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "for go there ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but not but not for", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the other one 's three values for endpoint already .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you need actually three to the five", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because if it has four inputs and then it itself has three values", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it can get big fast .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no it 's it 's sh", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "ev - it 's the eva .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but this one only has two .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "no it still has three ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "since ta they will still have three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "each so you 're from each point of view you 're making the same decision .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so from the point of view of the ob of the entity", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "want to view that ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "this and also , , the other places where ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like consider endpoint view , it has inputs coming from user budget , user thrift", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "those are not necessarily binary .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we 're we 're gonna have to use some care in the knowledge engineering to not have this explode .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it doesn't in the sense that", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "actually with the underlying semantics and it isn't like you have two hundred and fifty - six different ways of thinking about whether this user wants to go to some place .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we just have to figure out what the regularities are and code them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but what was gonna suggest next is we wanna work on this little longer", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but do want to also talk about the thing that we started into now of", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's all fine to say all these arrows come into the si same place", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what rule of combination is used there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so yes they so these things all affect it ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how do they affect it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and belief - nets have their own beliefs about what are good ways to do that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so is it 's it 's clearer clear enough what the issue is ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so do we wanna switch that now or we wanna do some more of this ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we just need to", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "in order to get some closure on this figure out how we 're gonna get this picture completely messy .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "here he here 's one of the things that you sh", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how easy it is to do this in the interface", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you it would be if you could actually just display at given time all the things that you pick up ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you click on \" endpoint \" ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and everything else fades", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you just see the links that are relevant to that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "does anybody remember the gui on this ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would almost say the other way to do that would be to open or make - many belief - nets", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then open them every time you wanted to look at different one", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's probably pretty easy do it to do it in html ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "have each of these thing each of the end belief - nets be page and then you click on the thing", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then li consider that it 's respective ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "anyway so it clear that even with this if we put in all the arrows nobody is gonna be able to read the diagram .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we have to figure out some display hack to do this", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "anyway let me consi suggest that 's not first - order consideration ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have two first - order considerations", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is what are the influences ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and how do they get combined mathematically ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how do we display them is an issue ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't , don't think this has been designed to support something like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", it might soon , if this is gonna be used in serious way like java base then it might soon be necessary to start modifying it for our purposes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that seems like perfectly feasible thing to get into ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we have to we want first .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so why don't you tell us little bit about decision nodes and what the choices might be for these ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can technically wear that as you 're talking .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's , do that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "put it in your ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this board works fine .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so recall the basic problem which is that you have belief - net and you have like lot of different nodes all contributing to one node .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so as we discussed specifying this thing is big pain", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it 's so will take long time to write down", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because if these have three possibilities each and this has three possibilities then you have two hundred and forty - three possibilities", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which is already lot of numbers to write down .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what helps us in our situation is that these all have values in the same set ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these are all like saying ev or ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it 's not just generalized situation like", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we wanna just take combination of", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we wanna view each of these as experts", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ea who are each of them is making decision based on some factors", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we wanna combine their decisions", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and create , sorta weighted combination .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "rover , the rover decision .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the what decision ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "all of their outputs combined to make decision .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so the problem is to specify the so the conditional property of this given all those ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's the way belief - nets are defined ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like each node given its parents ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that 's what we want ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let 's call this guy", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and let 's call these - one , - two xn ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we want probability that equals , ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "given that these are", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'ll just refer to this as like hat ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the co like all of them ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "given that the data says , , , , ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we would like to do this combination .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "wanna make everybody is with us before he goes on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's it 's cl is it clear what he wants to compute ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what we don't wanna do is to for every single combination of and and and every single letter , give number", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because that 's not desirable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what we wanna do is find some principled way of saying what each of these is", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we want it to be valid probability distribution ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we want it to add up to one ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so those are the two things that we need .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what , what jerry suggested earlier was that we , view these as voting", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we just take the we essentially take averages ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so here two people have voted for ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one has voted for ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and one has voted for ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we could say that the probabilities are , , probability of being is one over four , because one person voted for out of four", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and similarly , probability of", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this is probability of", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then probability of given all that is two out of four", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and probability of is one out of four .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that 's step that 's the that 's the that 's the basic thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that one outcome , that 's", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's - one voted for", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "- two voted for", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so this assumes symmetry and equal weights and all this things , which may or may not be good assumption ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's the outcome .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so step two is", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we 've assumed equal weights", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "whereas it might turn out that , some be that , what the the actual the verbal content of what the person said , like what what might be somehow more important than the", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "- one matters more than - two or", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we don't wanna like give them all equal weight", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so currently we 've been giving them all weight one fourth", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we could replace this by - one , - two , - three , and - four", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and in order for this to be valid probability distribution for each - hat , we just need that the 's sum to one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so they can be ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you could have point one , point three , point two , and point four , say .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's one .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and that 'd be one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that also seems to work fine .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so jus just to make understand this , so in this case we would still compute the average ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you 'd compute the weighted average ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the probability of would be", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it 'd be so in this case the probability that equals would be one times", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let 's see ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one full quarter times point one", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not one quarter ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so these numbers have been replaced with point one , point three , point two , and point four .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you can view these as gone .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this is step two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the next possibility is that we 've given just single weight to each expert ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "whereas it might be the case that in certain situations one of the experts is more reliable and in certain situations the other expert is more reliable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the way this is handled is by what 's called mixture of experts ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what you can have is", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you augment these diagrams like this", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you have new thing called \" \" ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is hidden variable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and what this is it gets its input from - one , - two , - three , and - four ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and what it does is it decides which of the experts is to be trusted in this particular situation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then these all come here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this is sightly more complicated .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what 's going on is that this node looks at these four values of those", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it decides in given these values which of these isn't likely to be more reliable or most reliable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so produces some , it produces number ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "either one , two , three , or four , in our situation ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now this guy he looks at the value of", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "say it 's two ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then he just selects the thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's all there is to say , about it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you can have mixture that", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so so the function of the thing that comes out of is very different from the function of the other inputs .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's driving how the other four are interpreted .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so passes vector on to the next node ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "vector of the weights as the se", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "vector with three zero 's and one ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's to tell the bottom node which one of the situations that it 's in", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or which one of the weighting systems", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the way you desc", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was just , if you wanted to pay attention to more than one you could pass weighting system though too ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "does have to have another input to tell it alpha , beta , whatever , or is the", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's determined by what the experts are saying ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like the type of situ", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it it just seems that like without that outside input that you 've got situation where , , like if - one says no ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "low value coming out of - on", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or if - one says no then ignore - one ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that seems like that 'd be weird ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "could be things like if - two and - three say yes then ignore - one also .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the situations that has , are they built into the net", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so they could either be hand coded or learned or", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "based on training data ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you specify one of these things for every one of those possi possible situations .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to learn them we need data ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "where are we gonna get data ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we need data with people intentions ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which is slightly tricky .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but what 's the data about", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like , are we able to get these nodes from the data ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like how thrifty the user is ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or do we have access to that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that 's my question ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like how do we , how do we have data about something like endpoint sub - ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or endpoint sub ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you would say , based on in this dialogue that we have which one of the things that they said whether it was the entity relations or whatever was the thing that determined what mode it was ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is what we wanna learn .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can you bring up the function thing ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "where is the thing thows you to", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's on the added variable ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is that it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it so either it 'll allow us to do everything", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which is unlikely ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "more likely it 'll allow us to do very few of these things", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and in that case we 'll have to just write up little things thow you to create such cpu 's on your own in the java base format .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was assuming that 's what we 'd always do", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was assuming that 's what we 'd always do ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in terms of java base it 's what you see is what you get in", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would be surprised if it supports anything more than what we have here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just talking about about that general end of things", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is there gonna be data soon from what people say when they 're interacting
