some ibm , , last january , , was there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so people who were working on the on their viavoice dictation product .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and they said , , the breathing is really terrible problem for them ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to not recognize breathing as speech .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , anything to reduce breathing is is good thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it seemed to me when was using dragon that it was really microphone placement helped an in , an enormous amount .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you want it enough to the side so that when you exhale through your nose , it doesn't the wind doesn't hit the mike .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "everyone 's adjusting their microphones , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and

the if it 's", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "you can definitely see it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can you see the breathing ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and so , , 've 've sat here and watched

in the middle of sentence .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and and then the other one is when they finish the sentence and then they laugh .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , , did did some double

don't think that we can do very with that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , , that 's not as frequent as just laughing between speaking ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so are do you treat breath and

concerned about is we wanted to do these digits", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and haven't heard , , from jose yet .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "what do you want ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could skip the digits .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we don't have to read digits each time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it , another bunch of digits .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "more data is good .",

"speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because the valleys and the peaks in the signal , , look like , , it doesn't follow to the to the energy in the signal .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it was problem , , with the scale .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and change the scale and we can see the variance .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the bottom line is it 's still not , , separating out very .",

{"text": "which is , what we said before is that ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it looks like ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "at least that you haven't found an obvious way to normalize", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so that the energy is anything like reliable , , indicator of the overlap .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "'m 'm still little think that 's little funny . these things @ @ seems like there should be ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but you don't want to keep , keep knocking at it if it 's if you 're not getting any result with that .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but , , the other things that we talked about is , , pitch - related things and harmonicity - related things ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so which we thought also should be some reasonable indicator .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "completely different tack on it wou is the one that was suggested , , by your colleagues in spain ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "which is to say , don't worry so much about the , , features .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that is to say , use , , as you 're doing with the speech , , nonspeech , use some very general features .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and , , then , , look at it more from the aspect of modeling .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "have have couple markov models", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and , , try to indi try to determine , , when is when are you in an overlap , when are you not in an overlap .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and let the , , statistical system determine what 's the way to look at the data .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it would be

time and given the fact that javier 's system already exists doing this thing ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "its main limitation is that , again , it 's only looking at silences which would", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 's better place to go .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that , , the possibility , , can be that , ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "thilo , , working , , with new class ,",

"speaker": "G"}, {"text": "cuz again the idea is there the limitation there again was that he was he was only using it to look at silence as as as putative split point between speakers .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but if you included , , broadened classes then in principle you can cover the overlap cases .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but 'm not too if we can really represent overlap with the

nonspeech .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "javier 's might be able to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it doesn't have the same gaus - , modeling ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which is drawback .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's has simple one .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's just it 's just isn't it just gaussian", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and then he ch you choose optimal splitting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it doesn't have it doesn't have any temporal , ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "'m misremembering , but did not had markov", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "gues don't remember either .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's been while .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": ", could have look at it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you mean ja - , javier program ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , javier di doesn't worked with , , markov", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "he on only train", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ". so he 's just he just computes gaussian over potential", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it was only gaussian .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "see . see .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and so it would work fine for detecting overlap .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is the idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's just , , that it", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "he has the two - pass issue that", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what he does is , as first pass he he does , , at where the divisions might be and he overestimates .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that 's just data reduction step ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that you 're not trying at every time interval .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so those are the putative places where he tries .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and now he 's doing that with silence", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that doesn't work", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with the meeting recorder .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if we used another method to get the first pass , it would probably work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's good method .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as long as the len as long the segments are long enough .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's the other problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "- . so let me go back to what you had , though .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "the other thing one could do is couldn't", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's so you have two categories", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and you have markov models for each .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "couldn't you have third category ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so you have , you have , , nonspeech , single - person speech , and multiple - person speech ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "he has this on his board actually .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "don't you have , like those several different categories on the board ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and then you have markov model for each ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "about , , adding , , another class too .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it 's not too easy , , the transition between the different class , to model them in the system have now .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it it could be possible , ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is all pretty gross .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "the the reason why , , was suggesting originally that we look at features is because , , we 're doing something we haven't done before ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we should at least look at the space and understand", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it seems like if two people two or more people talk at once , it should get louder ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and , , there should be some discontinuity in pitch contours ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "had the impression .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , , there should overall be , , smaller proportion of the total energy that is explained by any particular harmonic sequence in the spectrum .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so those are all things that should be there .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so far , , , jose has been", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "was told should be calling you pepe ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "by your friends ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "the has , , been exploring , , largely the energy issue", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "as with lot of things , it is not , like this , it 's not as simple as it sounds .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and then there 's , is it energy ? is it log energy ? is it lpc residual energy ? is it is it is it , , delta of those things ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "what is it no", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "just simple number absolute number isn't gonna work .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so it should be with compared to what ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "should there be long window for the normalizing factor and short window for what you 're looking at ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "or , , how short should they be ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "he 's been playing around with lot of these different things", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and so far at least has not come up with any combination that really gave you an indicator .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "still have hunch that there 's it 's in there some place ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but it may be given that you have limited time here , it just may not be the best thing to to focus on for the remaining of it .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "to overrule , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so pitch - related and harmonic - related , 'm somewhat more hopeful for it .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but it seems like if we just wanna get something to work ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that , , their suggestion of", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "- they were suggesting going to markov models ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but in addition there 's an expansion of what javier did .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and one of those things , looking at the statistical component ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "even if the features that you give it are not ideal for it , it 's just this general filter bank", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "eee it 's in there somewhere probably .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but , , what did you think about the possibility of using the javier software
