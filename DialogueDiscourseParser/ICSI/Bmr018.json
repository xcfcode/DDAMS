that from data keeping - track - of - the - data point of view , it may be best to send them whole meetings at time and not try to send them bits and pieces .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so the first thing is the automatic thing ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then it 's then it 's the transcribers tightening up ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then it 's ibm .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "- , - .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you might as ha run the automatic thing over the entire meeting ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then and then , , you would give ibm whatever was fixed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and have them fix it over the entire meeting too ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", but start from the beginning and go to the end ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if they were only half way through then that 's what you 'd give ibm .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as of what point ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the the question on my mind is do we for the transcribers to adjust the marks for the whole meeting before we give anything to ibm ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or do we go ahead and send them sample ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "why wouldn't we @ @", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if they were going sequentially through it , why wouldn't we give them", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "are we trying to get something done by the time brian comes ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that was the question . though .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so if we if we were , then it seems like giving them something , whatever they had gotten up to , would be better than nothing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they typically work for what , four hours , something like that ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the they should be able to get through whole meeting in one sitting .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "unless it 's lot harder than we is ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "which it could be , certainly .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if it 's got like for speakers then if", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we 're just doing the individual channels ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or seven or eight .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so it 's gonna be , depending on the number of people in the meeting ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there is this issue of , , if the segmenter thought there was no speech on particular stretch , on particular channel ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and there really was , then , if it didn't show up in mixed signal to verify , then it might be overlooked ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , , the question is \" should transcriber

"speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's what it seems to me too , in that if they need to , just like in the other cases , they can listen to the individual , if they need to .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and that cuts down the time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but they don't have to for most of it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "good , good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't see how that will work , though .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what what aspect ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you 're talking about tightening up time boundaries ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so how do you", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , they have the normal channeltrans interface where they have each individual speaker has their own line ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but you 're listening to the mixed signal and you 're tightening the boundaries ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "correcting the boundaries .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you shouldn't have to tighten them too much because thilo 's program does that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "should be pretty good ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "except for it doesn't do on short things , remember .",

"but those would be those would be", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it will it will miss", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you have to say \" - \" more slowly to get", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , 'm 'm actually serious .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'ll work on that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so it will miss like that which", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that 's something that the transcribers will have to have to do .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but presumably , most of those they should be able to hear from the mixed signal unless they 're embedded in the heavil heavy overlap section", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when in which case they 'd be listening to the channels anyway .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's that 's what 'm 'm concerned about the part .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that 's what 'm not about .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it 's an empirical question .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can't we couldn't we just have , ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this just doesn't fit with the software ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if didn't know anything about transcriber and was gonna make something to let them adjust boundaries , would just show them one channel at time , with the marks , and let them adju", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but then they have to do", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but then they for this meeting they would have to do seven times real time , and it would probably be more than that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because they 'd have to at least listen to each channel all the way through .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but but it 's very quick ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you scan , if you have display of the waveform .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you 're talking about visually .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the other problem is the breaths", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "cuz you also see the breaths on the waveform .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'ve 've looked at the int , 've tried to do that with single channel ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you do see all sorts of other besides just the voice .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that they 're going much more on acoustics than they are on visuals .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 'm not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what you the digital what the digital task that you had your interface ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "know for fact that one of those sh she could really she could judge what what the number was based on the on the waveform .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's actually true .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "found the same thing that when was scanning through the wave form could see when someone started to read digits just by the shapes .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "she could tell which one was seven .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'m 'm now entirely confused about what they do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , they 're they 're looking at mixed signal ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or they 're looking", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what are they looking at visually ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they have choice .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they could choose any signal to look at .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'ve tried lookin but usually they look at the mixed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but 've 've tried looking at the single signal and in order to judge when it when it was speech and when it wasn't ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the problem is then you have breaths which show up on the signal .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the procedure that you 're imagining , , people vary from this , is that they have the mixed signal wave form in front of them ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they have multiple ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", let 's see , there isn't we don't have transcription yet .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so but there 's markers of some sort that have been happening automatically ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and those show up on the mixed signal ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 's @ @ clicks ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they show up on the separate ribbons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you have separate ribbon for each channel ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there 're separate ribbons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it 'll be because it 's being segmented as channel at time with his with thilo 's new procedure ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then you don't have the correspondence of the times across the bins across the ribbons", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and is there line moving across the waveform as it goes ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the way you 're imaging is they play it ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they see this happened , then and if it 's about , they just let it slide ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if it there 's question on something , they stop and look at the individual wave form .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not \" look \" .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they wouldn't look at it at this point .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "they would just listen .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "they they might look at it ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the problem is that the interface doesn't really allow you to switch visuals .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "not very quickly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the problem is that the tcl - tk interface with the visuals , it 's very slow to load waveforms .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you can but it takes time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so when tried that was the first thing tried when first started it ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you can you can switch quickly between the audio ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you just can't get the visual display to show quickly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you have to", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it takes , , three , four minutes to", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", it takes it takes long enough", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's very slow to do that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it takes long enough cuz it has to reload the", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "exactly what it 's doing frankly", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "cuz but it it takes long enough that it 's just not practical alternative .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it does some shape pre - computation so that it can then scroll it quickly ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but you can cancel that .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but then you can't change the resolution or scroll quickly .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "now you could set up multiple windows , each one with different signal showing , and then look between the windows .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's the solution .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could do different interfaces ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "what if you preload them all ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so we could use like waves instead of transcriber ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and it loads faster , certainly .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "what if you were to preload all the channels or initially", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 's what tried originally .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so actually before , , dave gelbart did this , did an interface which showed each waveform and ea ribbon for each waveform ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but the problem with it is even with just three waveforms it was just painfully slow to scroll .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so you just scroll screen and it would , go \" kur - chunk ! \"", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and so it just was not doable with the current interface .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "am thinking if we have meeting with only four speakers", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , , you could fire up transcriber interface for , , in different windows , multiple ones , one for each channel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it 's hack but it would be one way of seeing the visual form .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that if we decide that we need that they need to see the visuals , we need to change the interface so that they can do that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's actually what of , loading the chopped up waveforms , , , that would make it faster", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the chopped up waveforms .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the problem is if anything 's cut off , you can't expand it from the chopped up", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and wouldn't that be the same as the mixed signal ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "no , the individual channels that were chopped up that", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 'd be to be able to go back and forth between those short segments .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "cuz you don't really nee like nine tenths of the time you 're throwing most of them out ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but what you need are tho that particular channel , or that particular location ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "might be , cuz we save those out already , , to be able to do that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it won't work for ibm ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it only works here cuz they 're not saving out the individual channels .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do think that this will be doable procedure ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and have them starting with mixed", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , , then when they get into overlaps , just have them systematically check all the channels to be that there isn't something hidden from audio view .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the mixed signal , the overlaps are pretty audible because it is volume equalized .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so they should be able to hear .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the only problem is , , counting how many and if they 're really correct or not .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that you can locate them very from the mixed signal ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but once that they happen , you can at least listen to the close talking ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but you would know that they were there , and then you would switch .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then you would switch into the other", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but now , to do this limitation , the switching is going to be switching of the audio ? is what she 's saying .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so they 're using their ears to do these markings anyway .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "did dave did dave do that change where you can actually just click rather than having to go up to the menu to listen to the individual channels ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "had suggested it before .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "whether he did it or not .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "'m not what click on the ribbon ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can get that", "speaker": "A"},

"we should get him to do that", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because , , that would be much , much faster than going to the menu .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "there 's reason disagree , and that is that , , you it 's very good to have dissociation between the visual and the audio .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there 're times when wanna hear the mixed signal ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "bu but want to transcribe on the single channel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then just buttons down at the bottom next to it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "don't don't see that it 's", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just something so that it 's not in the menu option so that you can do it much faster .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": ", that 's the that might be personal style thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "find it really convenient the way the way it 's set up now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it just seems to me that if you wanna quickly \" was that jane , no , was that chuck , no , was that morgan \" , now , you have to go up to the menu ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and each time , go up to the menu , select it , listen to that channel then click below ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text":

of the time it doesn't work very .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , , and the haven't done , the only way to check this now was for me to actually load these into waves and , , plus the alignments ,

'm still tinkering with it ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but it might be that we can't get clean alignments out of this out of those , , channels ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "unless we do this , , , cancellation business .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that 's , that was our plan ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it 's clear from dan that this is not something you can do in short amount of

forward .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it were straight - forward then we would try it ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , it 's good to hear that it was not straight - forward , thinking if we can get decent forced alignments , then at least we can do overall report of what happens with actual overlap in time ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "didn't think that his message said it wasn't straight - forward .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we 'd just", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "he 's just saying you have to look over longer time window when you do it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the but there are some issues of this timing , , in the recordings", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you just have to look over longer time when you 're trying to align the things ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can't you can't just look", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "are you talking about the fact that the recording software doesn't do time - synchronous ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "is that what you 're

"speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that was side issue .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the issue was that you have to you have you first have to have pretty good speech detection on the individual channels .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and it 's dynamic , so it was more dynamic than some simple models would be able to", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so there are some things available ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and too much about this area", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "where if people aren't moving around much than you could apply them ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it should work pretty if you took care of this recording time difference .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which should be pretty straight forward .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "which at least is defined ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but then if you add the dynamic aspect of adapting distances , then it wasn't", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it just wasn't something that he could do quickly and not in time for us to be able to do something by two weeks from now ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "less than week .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , so what we can do if anything , that 's worth , , eurospeech paper at this point .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "andreas , how did it work on the non - lapel ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's what was gonna say .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "haven't checked those yet .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's very tedious to check these .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we would really need , ideally , transcriber to time mark the , the be at least the beginning and ends of contiguous speech .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and , , then with the time marks , you can do an automatic comparison of your of your forced alignments .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because really the at least in terms of how we were gonna use this in our system was to get an ideal an idea , , for each channel about the start and end boundaries .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we don't really care about like intermediate word boundaries ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , that 's how 've been looking at it .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "don't care that the individual words are aligned correctly ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but you don't wanna , , infer from the alignment that someone spoke who didn't .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so that 's why was wondering if it", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it doesn't work for lapel , we can just not use that", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "haven't ha just haven't had the time to , , do the same procedure on one of the", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so would need would need channel that has speaker whose who has lot of overlap but , is non - lapel mike .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and , , where preferably , also there 's someone sitting next to them who talks lot .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so meeting with me in it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "someone can help me find good candidate and then would be willing to", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the best way to find that would be to look through these .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "cuz you can see the seat numbers ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then you can see what type of mike they were using .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so we just look for , , somebody sitting next to adam at one of the meetings", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "actually we can tell from the data that we have ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "from the insertions , ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": ", there 's way to tell .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it might not be single person who 's always overlapping that person but any number of people ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , , if you align the two hypothesis files across the channels , , just word alignment , you 'd be able to find that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so so that 's last", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ther there 're few things we could do .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one is just do like non - lapels if we can get good enough alignments .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "another one was to try to get", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "somehow align thilo 's energy segmentations with what we have .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but then you have the problem of not knowing where the words are because these meetings were done before that segmentation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but there 's something that could be done .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what what is why do you need the , , the forced alignment for the hlt for the eurospeech paper ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wanted to just do something not on recognition experiments", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because that 's ju way too early , but to be able to report , , actual numbers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like if we if we had hand - transcribed pe good alignments or hand - checked alignments , then we could do this paper .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's not that we need it to be automatic .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but without knowing where the real words are , in time", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it was to get it was to get more data and better to squeeze the boundaries in .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to to an overlap really if it 's really an overlap , or if it 's just segment correlated with an overlap ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that 's the difference to me between like real paper and , promissory paper .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , , if we", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it might be possible to take thilo 's output", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and like if you have , , like now these meetings are all ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "forgot the digital camera again .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "they 're time - aligned ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if these are two different channels and somebody 's talking here and somebody else is talking here , just that word ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if thilo can tell us that there 're boundaries here , we should be able to figure that out", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because the only thing transcribed in this channel is this word .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , , , if there are things", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you have two and they 're at the edges , it 's like here and here ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and there 's speech here , then it doesn't really help you ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "thilo 's won't put down two separate marks in that case", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it it would , but , , we exactly where the words are because the transcriber gave us two words in this time bin", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "thilo 's will . but .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and we don't really know ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's merging problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you had if you had if you had script which would", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'ve thought about this ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and 've discussed 've discussed it with thilo ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you have any ideas .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the , , in principle could imagine writing script which would approximate it to some degree ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but there is this problem of slippage ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that will get enough of the cases to be useful .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that would be really helpful .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that was another possibility .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "cuz it seemed like most of the cases are the single word sorts ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "or at least single phrase", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "they can be stretched .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in most of the bins .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "wouldn't make that generalization", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "cuz sometimes people will say , \" and then \" and there 's long pause", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and finish the sentence", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and sometimes it looks coherent and the", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's it 's not simple problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it 's really", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then it 's coupled with the problem that sometimes , , with fricative you might get the beginning of the word cut off", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so it 's coupled with the problem that thilo 's isn't perfect either .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we 've it 's like you have merging problem plus so merging plus this problem of , , not", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if the speech - nonspeech were perfect to begin with , the detector , that would already be an improvement ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that 's impossible , , that 's too much to ask .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so and may , , it 's", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that there always there would have to be some hand - tweaking ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it 's possible that script could be written to merge those two types of things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'ve 've discussed it with thilo and", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in terms of not him doing it ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we discussed some of the parameters of that", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and how hard it would be to in principle to write something that would do that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in the future it won't be as much as an issue if transcribers are using the tightened boundaries to start with ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then we have good idea of where the forced alignment is constrained to .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's just , , matter of we had the revolution we had the revolution of improved , , interface , , one month too late ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so 'm no if this", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it 's like , , it 's wonderful to have the revolution ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's it 's", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it 's just matter of , , from now on we 'll be able to have things channelized to begin with .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we 'll just have to see how hard that is .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so so whether the corrections take too much time .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "was just thinking about the fact that if thilo 's missed these short segments , that might be quite time - consuming for them to insert them .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but he also can adjust this minimum time duration constraint and then what you get is noises mostly ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that might be ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it might be easier to delete something that 's wrong than to insert something that 's missing .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and you can also see in the waveform", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what do you think , jane ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if you can feel confident that what the , that there 's actually something", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that you 're not gonna miss something ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "cuz then you just delete it , and you don't have to pick time .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the problem is it 's really good question ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and really find it pain in the neck to delete things", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because you have to get the mouse up there on the on the text line", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and and otherwise you just use an arrow to get down", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it depends on how lar", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there 's so many extra things that would make it one of them harder than the other , or vice versa .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's not simple question .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , , , in principle , like , , if one of them is easier then to bias it towards whichever one 's easier .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the semantics aren't clear when you delete segment ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because you would say you would have to determine what the surroundings were .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you could just say it 's noise , though , and write , , post - processor will just", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "all you have to do is just", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it 's really noise .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "or just say it 's just put \" , \" , like \" not speech \" ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's easier to add than delete , frankly ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then you can get", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because you have to , , maneuver around on the on both windows then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to add or to delete ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that that 's an interface issue that might be addressable .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's possible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it 's the semantics that are that are questionable to me ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that you delete something", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so let 's say someone is talking to here , and then you have little segment here .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "is that part of the speech ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "is it part of the nonspeech ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "what do you embed it in ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "there 's something , though , about keeping , and this is probably another discussion , keeping the that thilo 's detector detected as possible speech and just marking it as not speech than deleting it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because then when you align it , then the alignment can you can put reject model or whatever ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so then they could just like put", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's what you meant by just put an \" \" there .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and you 're consistent with the automatic system ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's an interesting idea .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "whereas if you delete it", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so so all they so they would have to do is put like an \" \" there .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "or some , , dummy reject mod", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so blank for blank for silence , \" \"", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "\" \" for speech , \" \"", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "\" \" else .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's actually better way to do it", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "cuz the the forced alignment will probably be more consistent than", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like , there 's complication which is that you can have speech and noise in", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if it 's just as easy ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", on the same channel , the same speaker ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so now sometimes you get ni microphone pop", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , , , there 're these fuzzy hybrid cases ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then the problem with the boundaries that have to be shifted around .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's not simple not simple

the , , pre - segmented , non - synchronous conversations ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "does it make sense to try to take what we have now , which are the ones that , , we have recognition on which

you talking about for paper , or are talking about for the corpus .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's good question actually .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "cuz for the corpus it would be if

"speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we wouldn't have to re - do them ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we would just have to edit them .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and also , , still haven't still haven't given up on forced alignment .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , you 're ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that when brian comes , this 'll be an interesting aspect to ask him as", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when brian kingsbury comes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you you said ryan .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and it 's like , \" who 's ryan ? \"", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "ryan could come .",
