.", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's an video has little different nature since", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now we 're all being recorded but we 're not being taped .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text":

it along .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "see the problem is it took , , it took at least six months for dan to get together the hardware and the software , and debug in the microphones , and in the boxes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it was really big deal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so we could get microphone array in here pretty easily", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , , have it

recorded so that you can", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and to do that , it we 're going to end up greatly increasing the disk space that we use up ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we also only have boards that will take up to sixteen channels", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and in this meeting , we 've got eight people and six mikes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and there we 're already using

"mentioned that , as practical matter ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the real issue is that , , there is no way to do recording extended to what we have now with low skew .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you would have completely separate set up ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which would mean that the sampling times and would be all over the place compared to this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it would depend on the level of pr processing you were doing later ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if you 're the person who 's doing array processing you actually care about funny little times .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and and so you actually wou would want to have completely different set up than we have ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one that would go up to thirty - two channels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or hundred thirty - two .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": "so , 'm kinda skeptical ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , , don't think we can share the resource in that way .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but what we could do is if there was someone else who 's interested they could have separate set up which they wouldn't be trying to synch with ours", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which might be useful for them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "at least they 'd have the data and the transcripts ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we can offer up the

if we have more information on the same data .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it 's if it 's impossible or if it 's lot of effort then you have to just balance the two ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text":

, of when to stop transcribing this one", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so wanted to keep it clear whose data were whose ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and , , meetings , , that they 're they go as long

{"text": "now all eight of them have differe , additional data sets . that means potentially as many as ten might be finished by the end of the month .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but the pre -

{"text": "she said it takes about , , sixty minutes transcription for every five minutes of real time .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so it 's about twelve to one ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "which is what we were thinking .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's in the range .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's pretty good .", "speaker": "H"}, {"text": ", these still , when they 're finished , ,
