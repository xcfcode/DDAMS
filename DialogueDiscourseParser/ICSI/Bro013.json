{"text": "but still you 're getting something like one point three percent for things that are same data as in ti - digits the same text .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , 'm the same system would get , , point three or point four on the actual ti - digits .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this , on both systems the these digits are showing up as harder .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which find interesting this is closer to", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's still read .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but still 's much closer to what people actually face , when they 're they 're dealing with people saying digits over the telephone .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'m they wouldn't release the numbers ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but don't think that the companies that do telephone speech

"speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what else we got ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did we end up giving up on , any eurospeech submissions ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "know thilo and dan ellis are

"speaker": "E"}, {"text": ", this is perhaps one of the reason why our system was not the best ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because with the new vad , it 's very the results are similar to the france telecom results and perhaps even better sometimes .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so there is this point .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the problem is that it 's very big and we still have to think how to where to put it", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and we if we put it on the server side , it doesn't work ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because on the server side features you already have lda applied from the from the terminal side", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and so you accumulate the delay", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so the vad should be before the lda", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "which means perhaps on the terminal side", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then smaller and", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so wha where did this good vad come from ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's from ogi .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so it 's the network trained it 's the network with the huge amounts on hidden of hidden units ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and nine input frames compared to the vad that was in the proposal which has very small amount of hidden units and fewer inputs .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "this is the one they had originally ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but they

"and . so we can", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so that 's problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the other thing is to use different vad entirely .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if there 's if", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what the thinking was amongst the the etsi folk", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if everybody let 's use this vad and take that out of there", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they just want , they don't want to fix the vad because they think there is some interaction between feature extraction and vad or frame dropping", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but they still want to just to give some requirement for this vad", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because it 's it will not be part of they don't want it to be part of the standard .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so . so it must be at least somewhat fixed but not completely .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so there just will be some requirements that are still not not yet ready .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but was thinking that \" , there may be some interaction ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but don't think we need to be stuck on using our or ogi 's vad .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could use somebody else 's if it 's smaller", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as long as it did the job .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that 's good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so there is this thing .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "designed new new filter", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because when designed other filters with shorter delay from the lda filters , there was one filter with fif sixty millisecond delay and the other with ten milliseconds", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and hynek suggested that both could have sixty - five sixty -", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's sixty - five .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "both should have sixty - five because", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you didn't gain anything , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and . so did that", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and it 's running .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , let 's see what will happen .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but the filter is closer to the reference filter .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so that means logically , in principle , it should be better .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so probably it 'll be worse .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or in the basic perverse nature of reality .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and

what happens .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , something that 's similar to the proposal too , but with msg stream .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "no , begin to play with matlab and to found some

representation which is with say ten second frames but lower frequency resolution .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so don't really know the theory .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's these are called \" time frequency representations \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and he 's making the time sh finer grained and the frequency resolution less fine grained .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so 'm my first stab actually in continuing his work is to re - implement this thing which changes the time and frequency resolutions", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "cuz he doesn't have code for me .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that 'll take some reading about the theory .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't really know the theory .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , another first step is", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the way want to extend his work is make it able to deal with time varying reverberation response", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we don't really know how fast the the reverberation response is varying the meeting recorder data", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we have this block least squares imp echo canceller implementation", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and want to try finding the response , say , between near mike and the table mike for someone using the echo canceller", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and looking at the echo canceller taps and then see how fast that varies from block to block .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that should give an idea of how fast the reverberation response is changing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we 're done .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so let 's read our digits and go home .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you do you read some of the zeros as 's and some as zeros .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is there particular way we 're supposed to read them ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are only zeros here .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "no . \" \" \" \"", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "\" \" \" \" and \" zero \" are two ways that we say that digit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "perhaps in the sheets there should be another sign for the", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if we want to the guy to say \" \"", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "people will do what they say .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in digit recognition we 've done before , you have you have two pronunciations for that value , \" \" and \" zero \" .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it 's perhaps more difficult for the people to prepare the database then , if", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because here you only have zeros", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "no , they just write", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and people pronounce \" \" or zero", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "they write down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or they write down zero", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and they and they each have their own pronunciation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if the sh the sheet was prepared with different sign for the \" \" .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but people wouldn't that wa", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there is no convention for it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see . , you 'd have to tell them \" when we write this , say it tha \" ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you just they just want people to read the digits as you ordinarily would", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and people say it different ways .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is this change from the last batch of forms ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because in the last batch it was spelled out which one you should read .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it was orthographic ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it was it was spelled out , and they decided they wanted to get at more the way people would really say things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's also why they 're they 're bunched together in these different groups .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so so it 's", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it 's it 's", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "everything 's fine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually , let me just since you brought it up , was just it was hard not to be self - conscious about that when it after we since we just discussed it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but realized that when 'm talking on the phone , certainly , and saying these numbers , almost always say zero .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and cuz because it 's two syllables .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's it 's more likely they 'll understand what said .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that that 's the habit 'm in ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but some people say \" \" and", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "normally say \" \" cuz it 's easier to say .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's shorter .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it 's so . so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now , don't think about it .", "speaker":
