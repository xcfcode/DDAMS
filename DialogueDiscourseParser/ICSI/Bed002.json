digits now , as long as you 've signed the consent form , that 's alright .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are we supposed to read digits at the same time ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we 're talking about doing all at the same time", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but cognitively that would be really difficult . to try to read them while everyone else is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "everyone would need extreme focus .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , when you 're reading the digit strings , the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we we may wind up with ver we we may need versions of all this garbage .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the first thing you 'd wanna do is just say which transcript you 're on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can see the transcript ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there 's two large number strings on the digits ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you would just read that one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then you read each line with small pause between the lines .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins .",

"speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have one more coming .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "why don't go ahead and read digit strings", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we can go on from there .", "speaker":

so that you minimize breath sounds ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that when you 're breathing , you don't breathe into the mike .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , everyone needs to fill out , only once , the speaker form and the consent form .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the short form", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you should read the consent form ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit all the transcripts .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , if you say things and you don't want them to be released to the general public , which , these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them , , you 'll be given an opportunity by email , , to bleep out any portions you

that 's about it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should do you want me to talk about why we 're doing this and what this project is ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no . there was there was let 's see .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "does nancy know that we 're meeting in here ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "sent an email .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "she got an emai she was notified .", "speaker":

unlikely .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "since it does isn't attributed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the but the but the", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if said , \" , hi jerry , how are you ? \" , we 're not gonna go through and cancel out the \" jerry \"s .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we will go through and , in the speaker id tags there 'll be , , - one seven , - one eight .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "good way of doing it on the audio , and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , wasn't complaining ,",

{"text": "but we find that", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we want the meeting to be as natural as possible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , we 're trying to do real meetings .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so we don't wanna have to do aliases", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we don't want people to be editing what they say .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that it 's better just as pro post - process to edit out every time you bash microsoft .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ". so why don't you tell us briefly", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "your give your normal schpiel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is the project is called meeting recorder", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and there are lots of different aspects of the project .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so my particular interest is in the pda of the future .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is mock - up of one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , we do believe the pda of the future will be made of wood .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the idea is that you 'd be able to put pda at the table at an impromptu meeting ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and record it ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on , on the meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that 's my particular interest ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is portable device to do , information retrieval on meetings .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "other people are interested in other aspects of meetings .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the first step on that , in any of these , is to collect some data .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so what we wanted is room that 's instrumented with both the table top microphones ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as as the close talking mikes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "gives us , , high quality audio ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "especially for people who aren't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , for people who are more interested in language , we didn't want to penalize them by having only the far field mikes available .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then also , , it 's very , very hard task in terms of speech recognition .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so , , on the far field mikes we can expect very low recognition results .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we wanted the near field mikes to at least isolate the difference between the two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that 's why we 're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then , all these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed synchronously", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that you can also do things like , , beam - forming on all the microphones", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and do research like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our intention is to release this data to the public , , probably through through body like the ldc .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , , just make it as generally available corpus .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there 's other work going on in meeting recording .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , we 're we 're working with sri ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "nist has started an effort which will include video .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we 're not including video , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and and then also , , small amount of assistance from ibm .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is also involved .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", and the digit strings , this is just more constrained task .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so because the general environment is so challenging , we decided to do at least one set of digit strings", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to give ourselves something easier .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it 's exactly the same digit strings as in ti - digits ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which is common connected digits corpus .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we 'll have some , , comparison to be able to be made .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so when the last person comes in , just have them wear wireless .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it should be on already .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "either one of those .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , read the digit strings and fill out the forms .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , the most important form is the consent form ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so just be be everyone signs that , if they consent .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'m it 's pretty usual for meetings that people come late ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you will have to leave what you set .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , just give me call ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which , my number 's up there when your meeting is over .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and 'm going to leave the mike here", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it 's {nonvocalsound} , but 'm not gonna be on", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so don't have them use this one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 'll just be sitting here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "adam , we will be using the , , screen as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you who got email about this , friday about what we 're up to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what was the nature of the email ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "this was about , inferring intentions from features in context , and the words ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like \" go to see \" , or \" visit \" , or some", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you didn't get it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "these have got better filters .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "cuz sent it to everybody .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you just blew it off .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's really simple though .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is the idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could pursue , , if we thought it 's it 's worth it but , , we will agree on that , , to come up with with very , very first crude prototype ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and do some implementation work , and do some research , and some modeling .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the idea is if you want to go somewhere ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "focus on that object down", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "actually walk with this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's the powder - tower .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now , , we found in our , , data and from experiments , that there 's three things you can do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can walk this way , and come really , really close to it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and touch it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you cannot enter or do anything else .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "unless you 're interested in rock climbing , it won't do you no good standing there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's just dark alley .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you can touch it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you want to actually go up or into the tower , you have to go this way ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then through some buildings and up some stairs and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you actually want to see the tower , and that 's what actually most people want to do , is just have good look of it , take picture for the family , you have to go this way , and go up here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and there you have vre really view it exploded , the during the thirty", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "years - war . really , interesting sight .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , these these lines are , , paths ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or so that 's ab er ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the street network of our geographic information system .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you can tell that we deliberately cut out this part .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because otherwise we couldn't get our gis system to take to lead people this way .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it would always use the closest point to the object ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then the tourists would be faced , , in front of wall ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it would do them no good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , what we found interesting is , first of all , intentions differ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you want to enter building .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you want to see it ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "take picture of it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or you actually want to come as close as possible to the building .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for whatever reason that may be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what 's it what 's it made out of ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so you would wanna touch it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you would want to touch it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this , these intentions , we we could , if we want to , call it the vista mode ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "where we just want to get the overview or look at it ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the enter mode ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the , , tango mode .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "always come up with silly names .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this \" tango \" means , literally translated , \" to touch \" .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so but sometimes the tango mode is really relevant in the in the sense that , , if you want to ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you don't have the intention of entering your building , but that something is really close to it , and you just want to approach it , or get to that building .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "consider , , the post office in chicago , building so large that it has its own zip code .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the entrance could be miles away from the closest point .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so sometimes it makes sense to to distinguish there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , , 've looked , , through twenty some", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "didn't look through all the data .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and there 's , lot more different ways in people , the ways people phrase how to get if they want to get to certain place .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and sometimes here it 's it 's little bit more obvious", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "should go back couple of steps", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and go through the", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , come in , sit down .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you grab yourself microphone .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you need to sign some and read some digits .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can sign afterwards .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have to al also have to read some digits .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": ". afterwards is fine .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they are uncomfortable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that was our idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it it also has to be switched on , nance .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , that one 's already on , he said .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's on ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that was the idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "people , when they when they want to go to building , sometimes they just want to look at it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "sometimes they want to enter it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and sometimes they want to get really close to it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's something we found .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's just truism .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the places where you will lead them for these intentions are sometimes ex in incredibly different .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "gave an example where the point where you end up if you want to look at it is completely different from where if you want to enter it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , this is how people may , may phrase those requests to mock - up system at least that 's the way they did it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we get tons of these \" how do get to \" , \" want to go to \" ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but also , \" give me directions to \" , and \" would like to see \" .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , what we can do , if we look closer closer at the data", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that was the wrong one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can look at some factors that may make difference .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "first of all ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , that 've completely forgot that when we talked .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is crucial factor , \" what type of object is it ? \"", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , some buildings you just don't want to take pictures of .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or very rarely .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you usually want to enter them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "some objects are more picturesque ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you more more highly photographed .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then the actual phrases may give us some idea of what the person wants .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "sometimes found in the , looking at the data , in superficial way , found some modifiers that may also give us hint ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "\" 'm trying to get to \"", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "\" need to get to \" .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "hints to the fact that you 're not really sightseeing and just there for pleasure and and so on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and this leads us straight to the context which also should be considered .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that whatever it is you 're doing at the moment may also inter influence the interpretation of phrase .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , this is , , really", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my suggestion is really simple .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we start with ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now , let me , , say one more thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what we do know , is that the parser we use in the smartkom system will never differentiate between any of these .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , all of these things will result in the same xml - three - structure .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "action \" go \" ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then an object .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it 's it 's way too crude to capture those differences in intentions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , , \" mmm !", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for deep understanding task , that 's playground or first little thing . \"", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "where we can start it and look", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "\" , we need , we gonna get those - three - structures .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the crude , undifferentiated parse .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we may need additional part of speech , or just some information on the verb , and modifiers , auxiliaries .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we 'll see .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and will try to come up with list of factors that we need to get out of there ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we want to get switch for the context .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is not something which we can actually monitor , now ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but just is something we can set .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then you can all imagine constrained satisfaction program , depending on what , , comes out .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we want to have an structure resulting", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we feed it through belief - net along those lines . we 'd get an inferred intention , we produce structure that differentiates between the vista , the enter , and the , , tango mode .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which we want to ignore .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but . that 's my idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's up for discussion .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can change all of it ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "any bit of it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "throw it all away .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now @ @ this email

have to go back and check .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , what is important is that we understand what the proposed task is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , the , robert and talked about this some on friday .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we 's - formed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we 's - formed , , starter task for this , , deeper understanding in the tourist domain .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , where exactly is the , , deeper understanding being done ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "like , is it before the bayes - net ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's the it 's always all of it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , in general it 's always going to be , the answer is , everywhere .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the notion is that , , this isn't real deep .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it 's deep enough that you can distinguish between these three quite different kinds of , , going to see some tourist thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , so that 's that 's the quote \" deep \" that we 're trying to get at .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , robert 's point is that the current front - end doesn't give you any way to", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not only doesn't it do it , but it also doesn't give you enough information to do it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it isn't like , if you just took what the front - end gives you , and used some clever inference algorithm on it , you would be able to figure out which of these is going on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and this is bu - in general it 's gonna be true of any deep understanding ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 's gonna be contextual things ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 're gonna be linguistic things ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 're gonna be discourse things ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they gotta be combined .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , my idea on how to combine them is with belief - net ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "although it may turn out that some different thing is gonna work better .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the idea would be that you , , take your", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you 're editing your slide ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as , as get ideas ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , discourse about that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that needs to go in there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so . this is minutes taking minutes as we go ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in his in his own way .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "anyway . so , , naively speaking , you 've you 've got for this little task , belief - net ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which is going to have as output , the conditional pr probability of one of three things ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that the person wants to , to view it , to enter it , or to tango with it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that the output of the belief - net is pretty formed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , then the inputs are going to be these kinds of things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , then the question is", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are two questions", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is , , one , where do you get this information from ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and two , what 's the structure of the belief - net ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what are the conditional probabilities of this , that , and the other , given these things ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you probably need intermediate nodes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we what they are yet .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it may be that , , , that , , knowing whether", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "another thing you want is some information abou , about the time of day .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now , they may wanna call that part of context .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the time of day matters lot .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , if things are closed , then , you", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "people won't want to enter it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "pe - people don't wanna enter them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , if it 's not obvious , you may want to actually , point out to people that it 's closed , what they 're going to is closed and they don't have the option of entering it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so another thing that can come up , and will come up as soon as you get serious about this is , that another option is to have more of dialogue .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if someone says something you could ask them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and now , one thing you could do is always ask them ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that 's boring .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it also it also be pain for the person using it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so one thing you could do

"but that 's , , not what we 're gonna do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that 's false state of the system , that it 's too close to call .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you want the you want the ability to you want the ability to ask ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but what you don't wanna do is onl build system that always asks every time ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's not getting at the scientific problem ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in general you 're , it 's gonna be much more complex than that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is purposely really simple case .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have one more point to bhaskara 's question .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "also the the deep understanding part of it is going to be in there to the extent that we , want it in terms of our modeling .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can start , , basic from human beings ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "going , walking , seeing ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can mem model all of that", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then compose whatever inferences we make out of these really conceptual primitives .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that will be extremely deep in the in my

you 've , , played with ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , not really .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "anyway . get one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "? so so one of one of the things we wanna do is actually , , pick package ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "doesn't matter which one ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "presumably one that 's got good interactive abilities ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "cuz lot of what we 're gonna be", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we don't need the one that 'll solve massive , , belief - nets quickly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "these are not gonna get big in the foreseeable future .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we do want one in which it 's easy to interact with and , , modify .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because that 's lot of what it 's gonna be , is , , playing with this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and probably one in which it 's easy to have , , what amounts to transcript files .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that if we have all these cases", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we make up cases that have these features ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then you 'd like to be able to say , \" , here 's bunch of cases \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 're even ones tha that you can do learning", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "? so you have all their cases and their results", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you have algorithms to go through and run around trying to set the probabilities for you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "probably that 's not worth it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "my is we aren't gonna have enough data that 's good enough to make the these data fitting ones worth it ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so would say you guy the first task for you two is to , pick package .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you wanna it , the standard things", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you want it stable , you want it", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , as soon as we have one , we can start trying to , , make first cut at what 's going on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "an - nuh .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it what like about it is it 's very concrete .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "? we we have we the outcomes are gonna be ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we have some data that 's loose ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can use our own intuition ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and see how hard it is ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , importantly , what intermediate nodes we think we need .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it if it turns out that just , thinking about the problem , you come up with things you really need to , this is the thing that is , , an intermediate little piece in your belief - net . that 'd be really interesting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it and it may serve as platform for person , me , or whoever , who is interested in doing some linguistic analysis .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have the for - framenet group here ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we can see what they have found out about those concepts already ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that are contained in the data ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", to come up with little set of features", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , even means of , extracting them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and and that altogether could also be , become paper that 's going to be published somewhere , if we sit down and write it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "when you said javabayes belief - net you were talking about ones that run on coffee ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or that are in the program language java ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , it turns out that there is , the new end of java libraries .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it turns out one called", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which is one that fair people around here use fair amount .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have no idea whether that 's", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the obvious advantage of that is that you can then , relatively easily , get all the other java packages for guis or whatever else you might want to do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that that 's why lot of people doing research use that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it may not be", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have no idea whether that 's the best choice", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "an and there 're plenty of people around , students in the department who , , live and breathe bayes - nets .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 's the tool kit that , kevin murphy has developed ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which might be useful too .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , , kevin would be good person to start with .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it 's available matlab code .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "nancy knows him .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "whether you have met kevin yet or not ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but since we all probably are pretty that , , the", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this the dialogue history is , producing xml documents .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "- three - is xml .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the ontology that , the student is constructing for me back in eml is in oil and that 's also in xml .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so that 's where lot of knowledge about bakeries , about hotels , about castles and is gonna come from .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , if it has that io capability and if it 's java package , it will definitely be able we can couple .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , , we 're {nonvocalsound} committed to xml as the , , interchange .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that 's , , not big deal .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , in terms of interchanging in and out of any module we build , it 'll be xml .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if you 're going off to queries to the ontology , , you 'll have to deal with its interface .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that 's that 's fine", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "all of these things have been built with much bigger projects than this in mind .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so they have worked very hard .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's blackboards and multi - wave blackboards", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and ways of interchanging and registering your", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that don't even worth us worrying about just yet .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we can get the core of the thing to work , in way that we 're comfortable with , then we ca we can get in and out of it with , , xml , , little descriptors .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", like , , the what you said about the getting input from just files about where you where you have the data , have specified the features and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's , , easy also to do with , , xml .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you could have an , you could make and xml format for that . .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "feature value xml format is probably as good way as any .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it 's als , it 's also worth , , while you 're poking around , poke around for xml packages that , do things you 'd like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "doesn't does smartkom system have such packages ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the the lib - three - library does that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the question is , you you 'll have to we 'll have to", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that should be ay we should be able to look at that", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what what came to my mind is was the notion of an idea that if there are nets that can actually lear try to set their own , , probability factors based on on input", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is in file format ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we , , get really wild on this , we may actually want to use some corpora that other people made", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , , if they are in mate , then we get documents with discourse annotations ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "from the discourse act down to the phonetic level .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "michael has project where , recognizing discourse acts", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and he does it all in mate ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so they 're actually annotating data and data .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if we if we 's worth it one of these days , not with this first prototype but with second , and we have the possibility of taking input that 's generated elsewhere and learn from that , that 'd be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 'd be , but do don't wanna count on it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can't you can't run your project based on the speculation that the data will come ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , no , , just for", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you don't have to actually design the nets .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just back door that we should devote", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so in terms of the , the what the smartkom gives us for - three - packages , it could be that they 're fine , or it could be eeh .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you don't , you don't really like it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we 're not we 're not abs we 're not required to use their packages .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we are required at the end to give them in their format ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it doesn't control what you do in , internally .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what 's the time frame for this ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "two , three days ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "bu 'd like that this , this week , to ha to to have , , , pick the , belief - net package", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and tell us what it is , and give us pointer so we can play with it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , then as soon as we have it , we should start trying to populate it for this problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "make first cut at , , what 's going on ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and probably the ea easiest way to do that is some on - line way .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can figure out whether you wanna make it web site", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was actually more joking . with the two or three days .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this was usual jo", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it will take as long as yo you need for that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , it might be interesting if the two of you can agree on who 's gonna be the speaker next monday , to tell us something about the net you picked ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and what it does , and how it does that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", or both of them speak .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or you can split it up .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we don't care .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that will be the assignment for next week , is to for slides and whatever net you picked", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and what it can do and how far you 've gotten .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'d like to also , though , , ha have first cut at what the belief - net looks like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "even if it 's really crude .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , , here here are", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we 're supposed to @ @ about features and whatnot ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and , as said , what 'd like to do is ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what would be really is you bring it in if if we could , , in the meeting , say , , \" here 's the package ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "here 's the current one we have , \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", \" what other ideas do you have ? \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then we can think about this idea of making up the data file .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", get tentative format for it ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let 's say xml , that says , , \" these are the various scenarios we 've experienced . \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can just add to that", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and there 'll be this file of them", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and when you think you 've got better belief - net , you just run it against this , this data file .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we 'll be like , hand , , doing all the probabilities .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": ", unt until we know more .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and what 's the relation to this with changing the table so that the system works in english ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so this is whi - while you were doing this , received two lovely emails .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the the full nt and the full linux version are there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'ve downloaded them both ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and started to unpack the linux one", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the nt one worked fine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and started unta pack the linux one ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it told me that 't really unpack it", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because it contains future date .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is the time difference between germany .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "had to until one ' clock this afternoon before was able to unpack it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now , then it will be my job to get this whole thing running both on swede and on this machine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so that we have it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then hopefully that hoping that my urgent message will now come through to ralph and tilman that it will send some more documentation along ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's what will do next monday", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is show the state and show the system and show that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the answer , johno , is that these are , at the moment , separate .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what one hopes is that when we understand how the analyzer works , we can both worry about converting it to english and worry about how it could ex extract the parameters we need for the belief - net .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "my question was more about time frame .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so we 're gonna do belief - nets this week ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "none of this is neither of these projects has got real tight time - line ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in the sense that over the next month there 's there 's deliverable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , it 's opportu in that sense it 's opportunistic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if if , if we don't get any information for these for several weeks then we aren't gonna sit around , , wasting time , trying to do the problem or what they", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "go on and do other things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but but the this point is really very , very valid that ultimately we hope that both will merge into harmonious and , , wonderful , , state", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "where we can not only do the bare necessities , ie , changing the table so it does exactly in english what it does in german , but also that we can have the system where we can say , \" , this is what it usually does ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and now we add this little thing to it \" ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "johno 's and bhaskara 's belief - net ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we plug it in ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then for these certain tasks ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we know that navigational tasks are gonna be core domain of the new system ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it all of sudden it does much better .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because it can produce better answers ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "tell the person , as showed you on this map ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "produce either , red line that goes to the vista point", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or red line that goes to the tango point", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or red line that goes to the door ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which would be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so not only can you show that something sensible but ultimately , if you produce system like this , it takes the person where it wants to go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "rather than taking him always to the geometric center of building ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is what they do now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we even had to take out bit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "nancy , you missed that part .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we had to take out bit of the road work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that it doesn't take you to the wall every time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this was actually an actual problem that we encountered ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which nobody have has", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because car navigation systems don't really care .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they get you to the beginning of the street ,", "speaker":

"speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you are miles away from the entrance .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because the postal address is mailbox somewhere .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the entrance where you actually wanna go is somewhere completely different .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so unless you 're mail person you really don't wanna go there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "probably not then ,",
