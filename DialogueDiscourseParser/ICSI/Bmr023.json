{"text": "if it 's only the transcript , though , this is my point , that", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's why 'm bringing this up again , because 't remember how we ended up .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that it was the transcrip", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "he wanted to do web interface that would make it", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "if it 's just the audio", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would give you access to the transcript and the audio .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that 's what adam wanted .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and don't remember how we ended up .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "with the web interface it 's interesting , because you could allow the person who signs to be informed when their transcript changes ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and , , would say \" no \" . like , don't wanna know ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but some people might be really interested", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and then in other words , they would be informed if there was some significant change other than typos and things like that .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "you decided you were whispering satanic incantations under your breath when you were", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "what happened to the small heads thing ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but , 'm just saying that , like , , you can say that any things that are deemed", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "they disappeared from view .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "anyway . , agree that at some point people probably won't care about typos but they would care about significant meaning changes", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and then they could be asked for their consent , , if those change .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "cuz assumi assuming we don't really distribute things that have any significant changes from what they sign anyway .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "how about having them approve the audio and not the transcripts ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that would be simpler ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we could count on them listening .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but no one will listen to the hours and hours of", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we just have to give them chance to listen to it , and if they don't , that 's their problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "unfortunately , , in the sign thing that they signed , it says \" transcripts \" .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , 'm serious .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "\" you 'll be you 'll be provided the transcripts when they 're available . \"", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's lot to ask for people that have been in lot of meetings .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "anyway , haven't we 've gone down this path number of times . know this can lead to extended conversations and not really get anywhere ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so let me just suggest that , off - line that , , the people involved figure it out and take care of it before it 's july .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so so that in july we can tell people \" yes , we have this and you can use it \" .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's done , ready , available .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , let 's see .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "what else we got ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "don did report about his project in class", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and , an oral and written version .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so that was he was doing with you .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's one thing we 're learning is that the amount", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we have eight meetings there", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "because we couldn't use the non - native all non - native meetings", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and it 's , , probably below threshold on enough data for us for the things we 're looking at", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "because the prosodic features are very noisy and so you need lot of data in order to model them .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so we 're starting to see some patterns", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and we 're hoping that with , , double or triple the data with twenty meetings or so , that we would start to get better results .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but we did find that some of the features that , gue jane would know about , that are expressing the distance of , , boundaries from peaks in the utterance and some local , , range pitch range effects , like how close people are to their floor , are showing up in these classifiers ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "which are also being given some word features that are cheating , cuz they 're true words .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so these are based on forced alignment .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "word features like , , word frequency", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and whether or not something 's backchannel and .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so , we 're starting to see , , some interesting patterns .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so the dominant features , including everything , were those quasi - cheating things .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it depends what you 're looking at , actually .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "sometimes positions in sentences , or in spurts , was helpful .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if that 's cheating , too .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "spurts wouldn't be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "spurts is not cheating except that the real words ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but roughly speaking , the recognized words are gonna give you similar type of position .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "would they give you the same number of words , though ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's either early or late .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "not exactly , but", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but ra somewhat ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "on the average .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it should be .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and actually that 's one of the things we 're interested in doing , is", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "have you tried using just time , as opposed to number of words ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just time position , like when the word starts ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if that was in the", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , time position relative to the beginning of the spurt .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 's all these things to do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we didn't try it ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "like , there 's lot of different features you could just pull out .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that wouldn't be cheating because you can detect pause pretty within the time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how about time position normalized by speak", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and it depends on speaking rate", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "speaking rate . .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 's actually why didn't use it at first .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but we one of the interesting things was", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "you reported on some te punctuation type", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "finding sentence boundaries , finding disfluency boundaries ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and then had done some work on finding from the foreground speech whether or not someone was likely to interrupt ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so where , if 'm talking now and someone and andreas is about to interrupt me , is he gonna choose certain place in my speech , either prosodically or word - based .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and there the prosodic features actually showed up", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "even though the word features were available .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and neat thing there too is tried some putting the speaker", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so , gave everybody short version of their name .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so the real names are in there ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "which we couldn't use .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we should use ds .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and those don't show up .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so that means that overall , , it wasn't just modeling morgan , or it wasn't just modeling single person ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but was trying to , , get general idea", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "the model the tree classifier was trying to find general locations that were applicable to different speakers ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "even though there are huge speaker effects .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "the but the main limitation now is because we 're only looking at things that happen every ten words or every twenty words , we need more data and more data per speaker .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 'd also be interesting to look at the edu meetings", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "because we did include meeting type as feature ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "whether you were in meeting recorder meeting or robustness meeting did matter to interrupts", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "because there are just fewer interrupts in the robustness meetings .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and so the classifier learns more about morgan than it does about the average person ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "which is not bad .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 'd probably do better than , but it wasn't generalizing .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and don , , we have long list of things he 's starting to look at now over the summer ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and he 'll be able to report on more things in the future .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but it was that we could at least go from the , jane 's transcripts and the , , recognizer output and get it to this point .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and it 's something mar probably use in her preliminary report", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "like , \" , we 're at the point where we 're training these classifiers", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and we 're just reporting very preliminary but suggestive results that some features , both word and pro prosodic , work . \"", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "the other thing that was interesting to me is that the pitch features are better than in switchboard .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and that really is from the close - talking mikes ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "cuz the pitch processing that was done has much cleaner behavior than the switchboard telephone bandwidth .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "better in what sense ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", first of all , the pitch tracks are have less , , halvings and doublings than switchboard", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and there 's lot less dropout ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so if you ask how many regions where you would normally expect some vowels to be occurring are completely devoid of pitch information ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "in other words the pitch tracker just didn't get high enough probability of voicing for words", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "for , , five word", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "there are much fewer than in switchboard .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so the missing we had big missing data problem in switchboard", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and , so the features weren't as reliable", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "cuz they were often just not available .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "could it have to do with the lower frequency cut - off on the switchboard ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that 's actually good .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "ma - . , the tele we had telephone bandwidth for switchboard", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and we had the an annoying telephone handset movement problem that may also affect it .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so we 're just getting better signals in this data .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "anyway , don 's been doing job", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and we hope to continue with , , andreas 's help and also some of thilo 's help on this ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "to try to get non - cheating version of how all this would work .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "has has , ? we just , just talked about this the other day , but has anybody had chance to try changing , , insertion penalty things with the with the , , using the tandem system input for the ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": ". tried that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it didn't , , help dramatically .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "were they out of balance ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "didn't didn't notice .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the relative number of", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there were higher number of deletions , actually .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , you , so , actually it preferred to have positive er , negative insertion penalty ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which means that ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , , it didn't change the", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "by adjusting that the ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the error changed by probably one percent or so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , , given that word error rate is so high , that 's not", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that 's so that 's not the problem .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that 's not the problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , , we just , ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "chuck and talked and the @ @ next thing to do is probably to tune the , the size of the gaussian system , , @ @ to this to this feature vector , which we haven't done .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we just used the same configuration as we used for the for the standard system .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , , , dan @ @ dan just sent me message saying that cmu used , , something like ten gaussians per cluster", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "each mixture has ten gaussians", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we 're using sixty - four ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we 're using sixty - four ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that 's big difference", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it might be way off", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and give very poorly trained , , , gaussians that way ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "an and poorly trained mixture weights .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so so , we have", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the turn - around time on the training when we train only the male system with , , , our small training set , is less than twenty - four hours ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we can run lots of , just brute force ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "try whole bunch of different , settings .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , , with the new machines it 'll be even better .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we get twelve of those ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but the plp features work , , , continue to improve the ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as said before , the using dan 's , , vocal tract normalization option works very .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , , @ @ ran one experiment where we 're just did the vocal tract le normalization only in the test data ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so didn't bother to retrain the models ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it improved by one percent ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which is about what we get with , with , , just @ @ actually doing both training and test normalization , , with , , the , , with the standard system .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , in few hours we 'll have the numbers for the for retraining everything with vocal tract length normalization", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so , that might even improve it further .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , it looks like the - fea features do very now with after having figured out all these little tricks to get it to work .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you mean you improve one percent over system that doesn't have any in it already ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so then we 'll have our baseline to compare the currently hideous , , new thing with .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and and what that suggests also is that the current switchboard mlp isn't trained on very good features .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because it was trained on whatever , , was used , , last time you did hub - five ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which didn't have any of the", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but all of these effects were like couple percent .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but if you add them all up you have , , almost five percent difference now .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "add all of them .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "one was one point five percent and one was point eight .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and now we have another percent with the", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's three point three .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "actually , and it 's ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what 's actually qu interesting is that with", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", you prob another half percent if you do the vtl in training ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then interestingly , if you optimize you get more of win out of rescoring the , , , the best lists ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and optimizing the weights ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "than you do with the standard ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the part that 's actually adjustment of the front - end per se as opposed to doing putting vtln in is it was couple percent .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "? it was it was there was there was one thing that was one and half percent and one that was point eight .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "let me see if remember what they were .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "one of them was , , the change to , because it did it all at once , to , from bark scale to mel scale ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "which really feel like saying in quotes ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because @ @ they 're essentially the same scale", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but the but any individual particular implementation of those things puts things in particular place .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "why did that cha ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so that 's why wanted to look", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "still haven't looked at it yet .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "wanna look at exactly where the filters were in the two ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and it 's probably something like there 's one fewer or one more filter in the sub one kilohertz band", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and for whatever reason with this particular experiment it was better", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "one way or the other .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it could be there 's something more fundamental", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but it , it yet .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and the other and the other that was like one and half ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and then there was point eight percent ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "what was the other thing ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that was combined with the triangular .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "those those two were together .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we weren't able to separate them out", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "cuz it was just done in one thing .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but then there was point eight percent which was something else .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the low - frequency cut - off .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you remember the ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": ". so that was that was , that one claim credit for , , in terms of screwing it up in the first place .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so that someone until someone else fixed it ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "which is that , , never put", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we had some problems before with offsets .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "this inf this went back to , , wall street journal .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so we had ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "ea everybody else who was doing wall street journal knew that there were big dc offsets in in these data in those data", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and and nobody happened to mention it to us ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and we were getting these , like , really terrible results ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "like two , three times the error everybody else was getting .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and then in casual conversation someone ment mentioned \" , , , , you 're taking care of the offsets . \"", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "said \" what offsets ? \"", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and at that point , , we were pretty new to the data", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and we 'd never really , like , looked at it on screen", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and then when we just put it on the screen and wroop !", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "there 's this big dc offset .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , , in plp", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "there was like or some or when they recorded it ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "no . it 's just , it 's it 's not uncommon for recorded electronics to have different , , dc offsets .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's it 's , , no big deal .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's , you could have ten , twenty , thirty millivolts , whatever ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and it 's consistently in there .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "most people 's front - ends have pre - emphasis with it , with zero at zero frequency ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so that it 's irrelevant .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but with , we didn't actually have that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we had we had the equivalent of pre - emphasis in , , fletcher - munson style weighting that occurs in the middle of", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but it doesn't actually have zero at zero frequency ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "like , , , typical simple fr pre - emphasis does .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we had something more fancy .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it was later on", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it didn't have that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so at that point reali \" sh we better have have high - pass filter \"", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "just , just take care of the problem .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so put in high - pass filter at , , ninety hertz or so , for sixteen kilohertz sampling rate .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and never put anything in to adjust it for different sampling rates .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and so , so , , the code doesn't know anything about that", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and so this is all at eight kilohertz", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and so it was at forty - five hertz instead of at instead of at ninety .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "if dan fixed it or , , what he", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "he made it parameter .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "he made it parameter .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so . , if he did it , he did fix it", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and then and then it 's taking care of sampling rate ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "what what is the parameter ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is it , , just the lower cut - off that you want ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's called , , - hpf .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "does hpf on his feat feature .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and but hpf , , when you put number after it , uses that as the hertz value of the cut - off .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "frankly , we never did that with the rasta filter either ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so the rasta filter is actually doing different thing in the modulation spectral domain depending on what sampling rate you 're doing ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "which is another old bug of mine .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so that was the problem there was we we had always intended to cut off below hundred hertz", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and it just wasn't doing it ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so now it is .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , that hep that helped us by , like , eight tenths of percent .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it still wasn't big deal .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but , , , again , after completing the current experiments , we 'll we can add up all the differences", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but but , my point was that , , the hybrid system thing that we did was , , primitive in many ways .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and agree with you that if we fixed lots of different things and they would all add up , we would probably have competitive system .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but not that much of it is due to the front - end per se .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "couple percent of it is , as far as see from this .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "unless you call , if you call vtl the front - en front - end , that 's , , little more .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but that 's more both , .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "one experiment we should we 'll probably need to do though when , at some point , is , since we 're using that same the net that was trained on plp without all these things in it , for the tandem system , we may wanna go back and retrain ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's what , . .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for the tandem . ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we can see if it what effect it has on the tandem processing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so so , do we expect ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "at this point 'm as , 'm wondering is it can we expect , , tandem system to do better than properly trained , gaussian system trained directly on the features with , , the ch choice of parameters ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's what we 're seeing in other areas . yes .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , it 's so ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , we but but we may not . , if it doesn't perform as , we may not know why .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "cuz we need to do the exact experiment .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the reason to should is because you 're putting in the same information and you 're transforming it to be more discriminative .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "now , in some databases wouldn't expect it to necessarily give you much", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and part of what view as the real power of it is that it gives you transformational capability for taking all sorts of different wild things that we do ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "not just the standard front - end ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but other things , like with multiple streams and ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and allows you to feed them to the other system with this through this funnel .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so that 's the real power of it .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "wouldn't expect huge in huge improvements .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but it should at least be roughly the same and little better .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "if it 's , , like way worse then ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , morgan , an another thing that andreas and were talking about was ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so @ @ in the first experiment that he did we just took the whole fifty - six , , outputs", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that 's , , compared to thirty - nine input feature vector from either mfcc or plp .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but one thing we could do is", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let let me just ask you something .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "when you say take the fifty - six outputs , these are the pre final nonlinearity outputs", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "through the regular tandem outputs .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and they 're and", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "through the klt .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "through the klt .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "all that kinda .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so then you do you use all fifty - six of the klt", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that 's what we did .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so one thing we were wondering is , if we did principal components and , say , took out just thirteen , and then did deltas and double - deltas on that", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we treated the first thirteen as though they were standard features .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "did dan do experiments like that to ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "talk with stephane .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "he did some things like that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it was either him or carmen .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "these were all different databases and different , in htk and all that ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so it may not apply .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but my recollection of it was that it didn't make it better but it didn't make it worse .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but , again , given all these differences , it 's more important in your case that you not take lot of these low - variance , , components .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "cuz in sense , the net 's already got quite bit of context in those features ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if we did deltas and double - deltas on top of those , we 're getting even more .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which could be good or not .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but there the main point is that , , , it took us while but we have the procedure for coupling the two systems debugged now", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , there 's still conceivably some bug somewhere in the way we 're feeding the tandem features", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "either generating them or feeding them to this to the sri system ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there might be ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "cuz that 's pretty big difference .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and 'm wondering how we can how we can debug that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'m actually quite that the feeding the features into the system and training it up ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that that 's this that 's essentially the same as we use with the ce with the fe features .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that 's working .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there could be bug in the somewhere before that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the another degree of freedom is how do you generate the transform ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and another one is the normalization of the inputs to the net .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "these nets are trained with particular normalization", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and when that gets screwed up it can really hurt it .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "'m doing what eric", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "eric coached me through then that part of it ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so 'm pretty confident in that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the only slight difference is that use normalization values that , , andreas calculated", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "from the original plp ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we actually don't do that normalization for the plp ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for the st just the straight plp features ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no . the the sri system does it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "system does that . .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , there 's there is room for bugs that we might not have discovered ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that 's that 's another", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would actually double check with stephane at this point ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "cuz he 's probably the one here", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "he and dan are the ones who are at this point most experienced with the tandem", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "thing and there may there may be some little bit here and there that is not being handled .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's hard with features ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "cuz you what they should look like .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can't just , like , print the values out in ascii and , , look at them , see if they 're", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not unless you had lot of time", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and also they 're not , as understand it , you don't have way to optimize the features for the final word error .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "these are just discriminative ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but they 're not , , optimized for the final", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "they 're optimized for phone discrimination ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it there 's always this question of whether you might do better with those features if there was way to train it for the word error metric that you 're actually that you 're actually", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "you actually are .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but but it but in an indirect way .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": ". it 's indirect , so you", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so wha what an and you may not be in this case ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "come to think of it ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because , , you 're just taking something that 's trained up elsewhere .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , what you what you do in the full procedure is you , , , have an embedded training .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so you the net is trained on , , , , viterbi alignment of the training data that comes from your full system .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and so that 's where the feedback comes all around , so that it is actually discriminant .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "you can prove that it 's it 's ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "if you believe in the viterbi assumption that , , getting the best path , , is almost equivalent to getting the best , , total probability , , then you actually do improve that by , by training up on local , local frames .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but , , we aren't actually doing that here ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because we did we did that for hybrid system ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and now we 're plugging it into another system", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and so it isn't it wouldn't quite apply here .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so another huge experiment we could do would be to take the tandem features , , do sri forced alignments using those features , and then re - do the net with those .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "mmm , exactly . exactly .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so that you can optimize it for the word error .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "another thing is since you 're not using the net for recognition per se but just for this transformation , it 's probably bigger than it needs to be .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so that would save lot of time .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and there 's mismatch in the phone sets .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , you 're using long larger phone set than what", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "actually all those things could could , could affect it as .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the other thing , , just to mention that stephane this was an innovation of stephane 's , which was pretty neat one ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and might particularly apply here , given all these things we 're mentioning .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "stephane 's idea was that , , discriminant , , approaches are .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "even the local ones , given , , these potential outer loops which , , you can convince yourself turn into the global ones .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "however , there 's times when it is not good .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "when something about the test set is different enough from the training set that , , the discrimination that you 're learning is is not good one .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , , his idea was to take as the input feature vector to the , , gaussian mixture system , , concatenation of the neural net outputs and the regular features .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we already talked about that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "didn't you did you do that already", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "no , but we when first started corresponding with dan about how to go about this , that was one of the things that we definitely went there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that makes lot of sense .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": ", 'm that stephane wasn't the first to think of it ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but actually stephane did it", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "- . and does it help ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and and it helped lot .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so that 's that 's our current best system in the , , in the aurora thing .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that makes sense .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and do you do klt transform on the con on the combined feature vector ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as you should never do worse .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": ", missed what you said .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "do you you do klt transform on the combined feature vector ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "actually , , you should check with him ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because he tried several different combinations .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because you end up with this huge feature vector , so that might be problem , unless you do some form of dimensionality reduction .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what don't remember is which came out best .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so he did one where he put put the whole thing into one klt ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and another one , since the plp things are already orthogonalized , he left them alone and just did klt on the on the net outputs", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and then concatenated that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and don't remember which was better .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "did he did he try to ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so he always ended up with feature vector that was twice as long as either one of the ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no . , .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "you have to check with him .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "actually , have to run .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'m into big ideas these days .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we need to close up", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "cuz need to save the data and , , get call .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "not to mention the fact that we 're missing snacks .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "did people wanna do the digits", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "or , , do them together ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "given that we 're in hurry for snacks , we should do them together .",
