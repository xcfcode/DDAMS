the , , front - end meeting this morning , too .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "much the same thing ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", there the point of interest to the group was primarily that , , the , the system that we had that was based on , that 's used by , , all the participants in aurora , was so much worse than the", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the interesting thing is that even though , yes , it 's digits task and that 's relatively small number of words and there 's bunch of digits that you train on , it 's just not as good as having very large amount of data and training up good big .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "also you had the adaptation in the sri system , which we didn't have in this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "di - did send you some results without adaptation ?",

this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one is , , the sri system is lot better than the htk", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this , , very limited training htk system .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the other is that , , the digits recorded here in this room with these close mikes , , are actually lot harder than the studio - recording ti - digits .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", one reason for that , , might be that there 's still even though it 's close - talking , there still is some noise and some room acoustics .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and another might be that , , 'd would presume that in the studio , , situation recording read speech that if somebody", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "did something little funny or pronounced something little funny or made little that they didn't include it ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they didn't include it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "they made them do it again .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "whereas , took out the ones that noticed that were blatant that were correctable .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so that , if someone just read the wrong digit , corrected it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then there was another one where jose couldn't tell whether couldn't tell whether he was saying zero or six .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and asked him and he couldn't tell either .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so cut it out .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so edited out the first , , word of the utterance .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so there 's little bit of correction but it 's definitely not as clean as ti - digits .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so my expectations is ti - digits would , especially", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "ti - digits is all american english .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so it would probably do even little better still", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "on the sri system ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but we could give it try .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but remember , we 're using telephone bandwidth front - end here , , on this , on this sri system ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , , was that that 's actually good thing", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because it gets rid of some of the , the noises ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": ", in the below and above the , the , , speech bandwidth", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "suspect that to get the last bit out of these higher - quality recordings you would have to , , use models that , , were trained on wider - band data .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and we can't do that or", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "wha - what 's ti - digits ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's wide - band , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's , we looked it up", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it is wide - band .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and it was actually twenty kilohertz sampling .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "did look that up .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "couldn't remember whether that was ti - digits or one of the other digit tasks .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but but , would", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's it 's easy enough to try ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "just run it on", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , morgan , you 're getting little breath noise .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "now , , does", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "you might wanna move the mike down little bit .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "one issue with that is that , the system has this , , notion of speaker to which is used in adaptation , variance norm , , both in , , mean and variance normalization", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and also in the vtl estimation .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "noticed the script that extracted it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so does so so does , , the ti - digits database have speakers that are known ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and is there is there enough data or comparable amount of data to what we have in our recordings here ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "how many speakers there are ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and how many speakers per utterance .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the other thing would be to do it without the adaptation and compare to these numbers without the adaptation .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", but 'm not so much worried about the adaptation , actually , than the , , the , , vtl estimation .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "if you have only one utterance per speaker you might actually screw up on estimating the warping , , factor .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "strongly suspect that they have more speakers than we do .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but it 's not the amount of speakers ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's the num it 's the amount of data per speaker .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so we could probably do an extraction that was roughly equivalent .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , although know how to run it , there are little few details here and there that 'll have to dig out .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so the system actually extracts the speaker id from the waveform names .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and there 's there 's script and that is actually all in one script .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so there 's this one script that parses waveform names", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and extracts things like the , , speaker , , id", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that can stand in as speaker id .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , we might have to modify that script to recognize the , , speakers , , in the in the , , , ti - digits database .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "or you can fake names for these waveforms that resemble the names that we use here for the for the meetings .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that would be the , probably the safest way to do", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "might have to do that anyway to do", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because we may have to do an extract to get the amount of data per speaker about .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the other thing is , isn't ti - digits isolated digits ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "or is that another one ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "'m looked through bunch of the digits corp corpora ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and now they 're all blurring .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "cuz one of them was literally people reading single digit .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then others were connected digits .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "most of ti - digits is connected digits , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the , we had bellcore corpus that we were using .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it was that 's that was isolated digits .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's the bell gram .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we can improve these numbers if we care to compr improve them by , , not starting with the switchboard models but by taking the switchboard models and doing supervised adaptation on small amount of digit data collected in this setting .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because that would adapt your models to the room acoustics", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and for the far - field microphones , , to the noise .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and that should really improve things , , further .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and then you use those adapted models , which are not speaker adapted but acous , channel adapted", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "use that as the starting models for your speaker adaptation .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but , , when you it depends whether you 're ju were just using this as starter task for , to get things going for conversational or if we 're really interested in connected digits .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the answer is both .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and for connected digits over the telephone you don't actually want to put whole lot of effort into adaptation", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because somebody gets on the phone and says number", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then you just want it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you don't don't ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is this that one 's better .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , , , my impression was that you were actually interested in the far - field microphone , , problem ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "you want to that 's the obvious thing to try .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "then , because you don't have any", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that 's where the most acoustic mismatch is between the currently used models and the the set up here .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so that 'd be anoth another interesting data point .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'m saying if we 'd want to do that as the as", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now you 're all watching me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it it clips over your ears .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if you have strong fe if you have strong preference , you could use this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you 're all watching .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is terrible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's just we has some spikes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , , we didn't use that one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'ll get it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you could if you want .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "at any rate , if", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and andre - andreas , your microphone 's little bit low .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we wanna use that as the", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if you see the picture", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it it like this .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then you have to scr", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "already adjusted this number of times .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "these mikes are not working as as would like .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "can't quite seem to", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "this contraption around your head is not working so .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "too many adju too many adjustments . .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "anyway , what was saying is that probably wouldn't want to see that as like the norm , that we compared all things to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that looks good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to , , the to have all this ad all this , , adaptation .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it 's an important data point , if you 're if", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the other thing that , , what barry was looking at was just that ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the near versus far .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , , the adaptation would get some of that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , even if there was , , only factor of two , like was saying in the email , that 's that 's big factor .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "liz , you could also just use the other mike if you 're having problems with that one .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "this would be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we we think that this has spikes on it ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's this thing 's this is too big for my head .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it 's not as good acoustically ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "your ears are too big .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "mine are too .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "everybody 's ears are too big for these things .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "no , my but this is too big for my head .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , , it doesn't , it 's sit", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you 'd rather have this one then it 's", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the to get that , , pivoted this way , it pivots like this .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "no this way .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and there 's screw that you can tighten .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "already tried to get it close .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if it doesn't bounce around too much , that 's actually good placement .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that looks good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it looks like it 's gonna bounce lot .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , where were we ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "adaptation , non - adaptation ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "factor of two ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what , wh what factor of two did you ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's tha that we were saying , , is how much worse is far than near , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it depends on which one you 're looking at ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that factor of two .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but for the everybody , it 's little under factor or two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was thinking was that , , we could actually try at least looking at , , some of the large vocabulary speech from far microphone ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "at least from the good one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "before we 'd get , , hundred and fifty percent error ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text":

extract the times from the near - field mike ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but you use the acoustics from the far - field mike .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "meant that so you have three choices .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there 's , you can use times where that person is talking only from the transcripts but the segmentations were synchronized .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or you can do forced alignment on the close - talking to determine that , the , within this segment , these really were the times that this person was talking", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and elsewhere in the segment other people are overlapping", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and just front - end those pieces .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or you can run it on the whole data ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which is which is , ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but but how did we get the how did we determine the links , , that we 're testing on in the we reported ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in the paper we took segments that are channel time - aligned ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which is now being changed in the transcription process ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which is good ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we took cases where the transcribers said there was only one person talking here ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because no one else had time any words in that segment", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and called that \" non - overlap \" .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that 's what we were getting those numbers from .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "tho - good the good numbers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the bad numbers were from the segments where there was overlap .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could start with the good ones .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but anyway so that we should try it once with the same conditions that were used to create those ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and in those same segments just use one of the", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we can do that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then , , , if we were getting , what , thirty - five , forty percent , something like that on that particular set ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "does it go to seventy or eighty ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or , does it use up so much memory we can't decode it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it might also depend on which speaker it is and how close they

probably one of the reasons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ". you could look at , , that pzm .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the other is , it 's very , , even though there 's 'm the the sri , ,

getting through .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , , you 're .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "prob - part of it is just the distance .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and aren't these pretty bad

five cent ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "buy them in packs of thousand type .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but , , people use those little mikes for everything", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because

used to using to working with .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "what we wanna do is we want to ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what do we do now ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and we 've talked about this in other contexts", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we want to have the ability to feed it different features .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then , , from the point of view of the front - end research , it would be , substituting for htk .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's the key thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then if we can feed it different features , then we can try all the different things that we 're trying there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then , , , also dave is thinking about using the data in different ways , , to , , explicitly work on reverberation", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "starting with some techniques that some other people have found somewhat useful , and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so so the key thing that 's missing here is the ability to feed , , other features into the recognizer", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and also then to train the system .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and , , es when chuck will be back", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but that 's exactly what he 's gonna", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "he 's he 's back ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but he drove for fourteen hours an and wasn't gonna make it in today .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , that 's one of the things that he said he would be working on .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "just to make that we can do that", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's , , the front - end is tha that 's in the sri recognizer is very in that it does lot of things on the fly", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but it unfortunately is not designed and , like the , , icsi system is , where you can feed it from pipeline of the command .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , the what that means probably for the foreseeable future is that you have to , , dump out ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "if you want to use some new features , you have to dump them into individual files", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and give those files to the recognizer .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we do we tend to do that anyway .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , although you can pipe it as , we tend to do it that way", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because that way you can concentrate on one block and not keep re - doing it over and over .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so tha that 's exactly what the - file is for .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the the cumbersome thing is , is that you actually have to dump out little files .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so for each segment that you want to recognize you have to dump out separate file .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "just like like as if there were these waveform segments ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but instead you have feature file segments .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so the the next thing we had on the agenda was something about alignments ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , we have", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did you wanna talk about it ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "give was just telling this to jane", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we were able to get some definite improvement on the forced alignments by looking at them first and then realizing the kinds of errors that were occurring", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "some of the errors occurring very frequently are just things like the first word being moved to as early as possible in the recognition ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which is , was both pruning problem", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and possibly problem with needing constraints on word locations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so we tried both of these st things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "got this whacky idea that just from looking at the data , that when people talk their words are usually chunked together .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's not that they say one word and then there 's bunch of words together .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they 're might say one word and then another word far away if they were doing just backchannels ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but in general , if there 's , like , five or six words and one word 's far away from it , that 's probably wrong on average .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then also , ca the pruning , , was too severe .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that 's actually interesting .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the pruning was the same value that we used for recognition .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and we had lowered that we had used tighter pruning after liz ran some experiments showing that , , it runs slower", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and there 's no real difference in", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "actually it was better with slightly better or about", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it was the same with tighter pruning .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so for free recognition , this the lower pruning value is better .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's probably cuz the recognition 's just bad en at point where it 's bad enough that you don't lose anything .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it turned out for to get accurate alignments it was really important to open up the pruning significantly .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because otherwise it would do greedy alignment , , in regions where there was no real speech yet from the foreground speaker .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so that was one big factor that helped improve things", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and then the other thing was that ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "as liz said the we enforce the fact that , , the foreground speech has to be continuous .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it cannot be you cannot have background speech hypothesis in the middle of the foreground speech .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "you can only have background speech at the beginning and the end .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": ", , it isn't always true ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and what we really want is some clever way to do this ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "where , , , from the data or from some hand - corrected alignments from transcribers that", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "things like words that do occur just by themselves alone , like backchannels that we did allow to have background speech around it", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "those would be able to do that ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the rest would be constrained .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , we have version that 's pretty good for the native speakers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yet about the non - native speakers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we also made noise models for the different grouped some of the mouth noises together .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , and then there 's background speech model .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there was some neat or , interesting cases ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like there 's one meeting where , , jose 's giving presentation", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and he 's talking about , , the word \" mixed signal \"", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and someone didn't understand , , that you were saying \" mixed \"", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so your speech - ch was saying something about mixed signal .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the next turn was lot of people saying \" mixed \" ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like \" he means mixed signal \" or \" it 's mixed \" .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the word \" mixed \" in this segment occurs , like , bunch of times .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and chuck 's on the lapel here ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and he also says \" mixed \"", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it 's at the last one ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the aligner aligns it everywhere else to everybody else 's \" mixed \" ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "cuz there 's no adaptation yet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so there 's there 's some issues about", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we probably want to adapt at least the foreground speaker .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , andreas tried adapting both the foreground and background generic speaker ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that 's actually little bit of funky model .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like , it gives you some weird alignments ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just because often the background speakers match better to the foreground than the foreground speaker .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so there 's some things there ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "especially when you get lots of the same words , , occurring in the", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can do better by , cloning", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so we have reject phone .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and you and what we wanted to try with , once we have this paper written and have little more time , , cloning that reject model", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and then one copy of it would be adapted to the foreground speaker to capture the rejects in the foreground ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "like fragments and ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and the other copy would be adapted to the background speaker .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": ", in general we actually", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now the words like partial words are reject models", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you normally allow those to match to any word .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then the background speech was also reject model ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so this constraint of not allowing rejects in between", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it needs to differentiate between the two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so just working through bunch of debugging kinds of issues .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and another one is turns , like people starting with \" \"", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and someone else is \" how about \" .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the word \" \" is in this segment multiple times ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and as soon as it occurs usually the aligner will try to align it to the first person who says it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then that constraint of , proximity constraint will push it over to the person who really said it in general .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is the proximity constraint hard constraint ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "or did you do some probabilistic weighting distance , or ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "now it 's kluge .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we it 's straightforward to actually just have penalty that doesn't completely disallows it but discourages it .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but , , we just didn't have time to play with , , tuning yet another yet another parameter .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the ve level .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and really the reason we can't do it is just that we don't have we don't have ground truth for these .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , we would need hand - marked , , word - level alignments", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "or at least the boundaries of the speech betw , between the speakers .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and then use that as reference", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and tune the parameters of the of the model , , to op to get the best performance .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "given , wa was gonna ask you anyway , , how you assessed that things were better .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "looked at them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "spent two days , in waves", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because , the alignments share lot in common ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you 're yo you 're looking at these segments where there 's lot of speech .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "lot of them have lot of words .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not by every speaker", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but by some speaker there 's lot of words .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that if you look at the individual segments from just one person you don't see lot of words ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but altogether you 'll see lot of words up there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so the reject is also mapping and pauses", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so looked at them all in waves", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and just lined up all the alignments ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , at first it looked like mess", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then the more looked at it , \" , it 's moving these words leftward", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and \" , it wasn't that bad .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it was just doing certain things wrong .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , don't , , have time to to look of them", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it would be really useful to have , like , transcriber who could use waves ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just mark , like , the beginning and end of the foreground speaker 's real words", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like , the beginning of the first word , the end of the last word", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we could , , do some adjustments .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have to ask you something ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is does it have to be waves ? because if we could benefit from what you did , incorporate that into the present transcripts , that would help .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then , , the other thing is , believe that did hand", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so . one of these transcripts was gone over by transcriber", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then hand - marked it myself so that we do have , , the beginning and ending of individual utterances .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "didn't do it word level ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so so for one of the groups .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also went back to the original one that first transcribed and did it , utterance by utterance for that particular one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you do have", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if that 's sufficient unit , that you do have hand - marking for that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it 'd be wonderful to be able to benefit from your waves .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we don't care what tool you use .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": ", if you can , if you wanna", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "used it in transcriber", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it 's it 's in the", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "jane and were just in terms of the tool , talking about this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "sue had some reactions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "interface - wise if you 're looking at speech , you wanna be able to know really where the words are .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so , we can give you some examples of what this output looks like ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "middle of the word , or", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and see if you can in incorporate it into the transcriber tool some way ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'m thinking just ch incorporating it into the representation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it 's if it 's", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you mean like , word start insights .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you have start points , if you have , like , time tags ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which is what assume .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "isn't that what you ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "see , adam would be", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "whatever you use .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we convert it to this format that the , , nist scoring tool unders , ctm . conversation time - marked file .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and and then that 's the that 's what the", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "transcriber , , outputs ctm .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so you would know this more than would .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it seems like she if she 's if she 's moving time marks around ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "since our representation in transcriber uses time marks , it seems like there should be some way of using that benefitting from that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it wou the advantage would just be that when you brought up bin you would be able if you were zoomed in enough in transcriber to see all the words ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you would be able to , like , have the words located in time ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you wanted to do that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so so if we even just had it sounds like we almost do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we we have two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just ha , trying out the alignment procedure that you have on that", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you could actually get something , , get an objective measure .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you mean on the hand - marked ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we only hav only looked at actually alignments from one meeting that we chose ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually , not randomly .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we knew we knew that it had these insertion errors from", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it had average recognition performance in bunch of speakers", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it was meeting recorder meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , , we should try to use what you have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did re - run recognition on your new version of mr one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the one with dan ellis in it and eric .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "- . , exactly . .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't think that was the new version .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "actually it wasn't the new ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it was the medium new .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but but we would we should do the latest version .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it was the one from last week .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you did you adjust the utterance times , , for each channel ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "yes , did .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and furthermore , found that there were certain number where not lot , but several times actually moved an utterance from adam 's channel to dan 's or from dan 's to adam 's .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so there was some speaker identif", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the reason was because transcribed that at point before , before we had the multiple audio available", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so couldn't switch between the audio .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "transcribed it off of the mixed channel entirely ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which meant in overlaps , was at at terrific disadvantage .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in addition it was before the channelized , , possibility was there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and finally did it using the speakers of my , of , off the cpu on my on my machine", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "cuz didn't have headphone .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it @ @ , like ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", in retrospect it would 've been good to ha have got should 've gotten headphone .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but in any case , , thi this is this was transcribed in in , , less optimal way than the ones that came after it ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and was able to , an and this meant that there were some speaker identif identifications", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which were changes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "know there were some speaker labelling problems , , after interruptions .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "is that what you 're referring to ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "cuz there 's this one instance when , , you 're running down the stairs .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "remember this meeting really .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "don has had he knows he can just read it like play .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'ve 'm very acquainted with this meeting .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "\" and then she said , and then he said . \"", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , , there 's one point when you 're running down the stairs .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and , like , there 's an interruption .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "you interrupt somebody ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but then there 's no line after that .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "there 's no speaker identification after that line .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "is that what you 're talking about ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "or were there mislabellings as far as , like , the adam was ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that was fixed , , before", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "cuz let about that .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "no , tha that that went away couple of versions ago ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it 's good to know .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you 're actually saying that certain , , speakers were mis - identified .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so , with under , , listening to the mixed channel , there were times when , as surprising as that is , got adam 's voice confused with dan 's and vice versa", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not for long utterances ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but jus just couple of places ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and embedde embedded in overlaps .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the other thing that was interesting to me was that picked up lot of , , backchannels which were hidden in the mixed signal ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which , , , you not too surprising .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the other thing that", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "hadn't thought about this ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but thou wanted to raise this when you were , with respect to also strategy which might help with the alignments potentially ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when was looking at these backchannels , they were turning up usually very often in , won't say \" usually \" but anyway , very often , picked them up in channel which was the person who had asked question .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , like , someone says \" an and have you done the so - and - so ? \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then there would be backchannels ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it would be the person who asked the question .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "other people weren't really doing much backchannelling .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , , sometimes you have the , - .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's interesting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it wouldn't be perfect ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it does seem more natural to give backchannel when you 're somehow involved in the topic ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , that 's really interesting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the most natural way is for you to have initiated the topic by asking question .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's interesting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no . it 's actually what 's going on is backchannelling is something that happens in two - party conversations .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and if you ask someone question , you essentially initiating little two - party conversation .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "actu , when we looked at this", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so then you 're so and then you 're expected to backchannel", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "because the person is addressing you directly and not everybody .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "exactly my point .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "an - and so this is the expectation thing that , ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but in addition , , if someone has done this analysis himself and isn't involved in the dyad , but they might also give backchannels to verify what the answer is that this that the answerer 's given", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "tell you , say say \" - \" lot ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it 's interesting", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "while people are talking to each other .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but there are fewer there are fewer \" - huhs \" .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just from we were looking at word frequency lists to try to find the cases that we would allow to have the reject words in between in doing the alignment .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the ones we wouldn't constrain to be next to the other words .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and \" - \" is not as frequent", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as it would be in switchboard ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you looked at just word frequency list of one - word short utterances .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and \" \" is way up there ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but not \" - \" .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so was thinking", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "thi it 's not like you 're being encouraged by everybody else to keep talking in the meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , that 's all , 'll stop there ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "cuz what you say makes lot of sense .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and what you say is the is the re , other side of this ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which is that , , so there are lots of channels where you don't have these backchannels , when question has been asked", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 's just probably less backchannelling in general ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that 's good news , really .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "even if you consider every other person altogether one person in the meeting ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we 'll find out anyway .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we were the other thing we 're should say is that we 're gonna , try compare this type of overlap analysis to switchboard ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "where we have both sides , so that we can try to answer this question of , , is there really more overlap in meetings or is it just because we don't have the other channel in switchboard", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we what people are doing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "try to create paper out of that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", you folks have probably already told me ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but were you intending to do eurospeech submission ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you mean the one due tomorrow

do as do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 'll probably be little late ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but 'm gonna try it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it is different .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text":
