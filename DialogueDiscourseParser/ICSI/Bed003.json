"B"}, {"text": "it 's just the businessman , the tourist , unknown .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "\" verb used \" is actually personally amusing", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "mainly because it 's it 's

"speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's that needs lot of work .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that would 've made the probably significantly be more complicated to enter ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text":

we haven't , managed", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like we don't have nodes for \" discourse \" and \" parse \" ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "although like in some sense they are parts of this belief - net .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the idea is that we just extract those features from them , so we don't actually have node for the entire parse ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because we 'd never do inference on it anyway ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so some of the top row of things", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what 's what 's \" disc admission fee \" ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "whether they discuss the admission fees .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we looked at the data", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and in lot of data people were saying things like \" can get to this place

just at \" tourist \" ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we just decided to keep all the things we extracted to point at the middle and then down .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "why is the landmark", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the landmark is facing to the tourists .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's because we 're talking about landmarks as touristic landmarks", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would be whatever building they referred to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so let 's see .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "disc - \" admission fee \" is binary thing ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "\"

"but it could be , , based upon hour", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or dis we could discrete it des descret - ize it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "normally context will include huge amount of information ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , we are just using the particular part of the context which consists of the switch that they flick to indicate whether they 're tourist or not , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that 's given in their input .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it 's not really all of context .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "similarly prosody is not all of prosody",

help you for doing business versus tourist ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which is which one ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the context being ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if that question 's in general ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "\" are you \"", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do they allow business people to be doing non - business things at the moment ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so then

.", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so then landmark is", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "\" verb used \" is like ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now we only have three values ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but

suggest to for to proceed with this in the sense that throughout this week the three of us will talk some more about segmenting off different regions ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we make up some

distribution .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "cuz if it 's like , if it 's four things coming in ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , say , some of them have like three possibilities and all that .",

and all this weird happens at the line up and you 're like", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the only like possible interpretation is that they are like come here just to rob the museum to that effect .",

one thing we could do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually , have ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also we can , start looking at the smartkom tables", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually wanted to show that to you now", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you want to trade ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "actually made mistake because it fell asleep", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and when linux falls

"speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's plugged in .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and don't have an ip address , they can't look up", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they who localhost is , and and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it 's , , simple solution .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can just , go downstairs and and look at this ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but not today .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the other thing will", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have to report , data collection .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we interviewed fey ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "she 's willing to do it ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "meaning be the wizard for the data collection ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also transcribe little bit , if she has to ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but also recruiting subjects , organizing them , and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that looks good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "jerry however suggested that we should have trial run with her ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see whether she can actually do all the spontaneous , eloquent and creativeness that we expect of the wizard .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and talked to liz about this", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it looks as if friday afternoon will be the time when we have first trial run for the data .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so who would be the subject of this trial run ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "who will there be is one is you one of you gonna be the subject ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "liz also volunteered to be the first subject , which might be even better than us .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one of us ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we do need her for the technical , then one of you has to jump in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like how we 've you have successfully narrowed it down .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "\" is one of you going to be the subject ? \"", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is one of you", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "haven't done it yet .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "figured it has to be someone who 's , , familiar enough with the data to problems for the wizard , so we can , , see if they 're good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "plants ? someone who can plant difficult things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's what we wanna check ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in this case it 's it 's testing of the wizard rather than of the subject .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "isn't that what it is ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes we would like to test the wizard ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , if we take subject that is completely unfamiliar with the task , or any of the set up , we get more realistic", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would be reasonable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's probably good enough test of", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "having an actively antagonistic ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that might be little unfair .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'m if we ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you think there 's chance we might need liz for , whatever , the technical side of things ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'m we can get other people around who anything , if we want another subject .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like drag ben into it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "although he might problems", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , is it experimental setup for the , data collection ready determined ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "\" test the wizard . \"", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "want that on - shirt .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's it 's", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "experimental setup on the technical issue", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "except we st we still need recording device for the wizard ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just tape recorder that 's running in room .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but in terms of specifying the scenario , we 've gotten little further", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we wanted to until we know who is the wizard ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and have the wizard partake in the ultimate definition probe .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so so if on friday it turns out that she really likes it and we really like her , then nothing should stop us from sitting down next week and getting all the details completely figured out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the ideal task , will have whatever", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how much the structure of the evolving bayes - net will af affect", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like we wanna we wanna be able to collect as much of the variables that are needed for that ,",

tango , enter , vista is , itself , an ad - hoc scenario .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the the basic idea behind the data collection was the following .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the data we get from munich is very command line ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "hardly anything complicated .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no metaphors whatsoever .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not rich language .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we wanted just to collect data , to get that elicits more , , that elicits richer language .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we actually did not want to constrain it too much ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just see what people say .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we 'll discover the phenomenon the phenomena that we want to solve , , with whatever engine we come up with .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this this is parallel track ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there they hopefully meet ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so in other words this data collection is more general .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it could it could be used for not just this task .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it should tell us , , what phenomenon could occur ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it should tell us also something about the difference between people who think they speak to computer versus people who think they speak to human being", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the differences there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it may get us some more information on the human - machine pragmatics , , that no one knows anything about , as of yesterday .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and nothing has changed since then ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and secondly , now that we have started to lick blood with this ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and especially since johno can't stop tango - ing , we may actually include , , those intentions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so now we should have at least one navigational task with explicit", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not ex it 's implicit that the person wants to enter ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and some task where it 's more or less explicit", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that the person wants to take picture ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or see it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that we can label it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's how we get corpus that we can label .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "whereas , , if we 'd just get data we 'd never they actually wanted ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we 'd get no cues .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that was that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so is this the official end of the meeting now ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "looks like it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what 's \" economics , the fallacy \" ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "randomly
