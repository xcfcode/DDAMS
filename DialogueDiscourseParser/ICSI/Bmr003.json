get that just with , , media costs ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we get it for free", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "cuz they 're distributing it through the ldc .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that

"A"}, {"text": "thi - this is the process of converting audio to text ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and this requires humans just like the stp .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we 're we 're at this point only looking for word level .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so all so what you have to do is just identify segment of speech in time , and then write down what was said within it ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and identify the speaker .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so the things we that we know that want are the text , the start and end , and the speaker .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but other people are interested in stress marking .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so jane is doing primary stress , , stress marks as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then things like repairs , and false starts , and , filled pauses , and all that other , we have to decide how much of that we wanna do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did include glo , certain first pass .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "my my view on it was when you have repair then , it seems", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we saw , there was this presentation in the one of the speech group meetings about how", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and liz has done some too on that , that it , that you get it bracketed in terms of like", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if it 's parenthetical , which know that liz has worked on , then you 'll have different prosodic aspects .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then also if it 's if it 's repair where they 're like what did , then it 's to have sense of the continuity of the utterance ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the start to be to the finish .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and , , it 's little bit deceptive if you include the repai the pre - repair part", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and sometimes or of it 's in the middle .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "anyway , so what was doing was bracketing them to indicate that they were repairs", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "which isn't , very time - consuming .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "is there already some plan in place for how this gonna be staffed or done ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or is it real is that what we 're talking about here ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's part of the thing we 're talking about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what we wanted to do was have jane do one meeting 's worth ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "forty minutes to an hour ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as pilot study .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it this is like five times real time or ten times real time", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as pilot study .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "ten times about ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is and so one of the things was to get an estimate of how long it would take ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then also what tools we would use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so the next decision which has to be made actually pretty soon is how are we gonna do it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so you make jane do the first one", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so then she can decide , , we don't need all this ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just the words are fine .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "wanna hear about these , we have you were continuing with the transcription conventions for", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so one option is to get linguistics grad

will require post pass ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "people will have to look at it more than once to make that it 's been done correctly ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but can't imagine that we 're gonna get anything that much better from commercial one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the commercial ones 'm will be much more expensive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can't we get joy to do it all ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , that 's", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we will just get joy and jane to do everything .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is tha wasn't that what she was doing before ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , , that 's what we 're talking about is getting some slaves who need money", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "object to that characterization !", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and so again , have to say \" are we recording \"", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then say , , morgan has consistently resisted telling me how much money we have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the answer is zero .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there 's reason why he 's resisted .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it 's zero then we can't do any transcription .", "speaker": "A"},

can you could get people to , to do it in exchange .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but , , morgan 's in bind over this", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and thing to do is just the field of dreams theory

"speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what , what was now we have", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so gave him the proposal for the transcription conventions .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "he made his , , suggestion of improvement .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the the it 's good suggestion .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so as far as 'm concerned those transcription conventions are fixed now .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and so my next plan would be", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "what what do they cover ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they 're very minimal .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , it would be good to just to summarize that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , , one of them is the idea of how to indicate speaker change ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and this is way which meshes with , , making it so that , , , on the at the", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "boy , it 's such interface .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "when you when you get the , you get the speech signal you also get down beneath it , an indication of , ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if you have two speakers overlapping in in single segment , you see them one displayed one above each other .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then at the same time the top part of the screen is the actual verbatim thing .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you can clip click on individual utterances and it 'll take you immediately to that part of the

speakers ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the user interface only allows two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so if you 're using their interface to specify overlapping speakers you can only do two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but my script can handle any .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and their save format can handle any .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so , , using this the convention that

"speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they said they wanted to do it but that the code is really very organized around single channels .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that 's unlikely to ha happen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do - do what they 're using it for ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "why 'd they develop it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for this exact task ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text":

"B"}, {"text": "pre - lay .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and they 've thought about things .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": ", they do have", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so you have when you play it back , , it 's it is useful to have , , break mark to se segment it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but it wouldn't be strictly necessary", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "cuz you can use the , the tabbed key to toggle the sound on and off .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 'll stop the speech if you press tab .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's feature .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then also once you 've put break in then you have the option of cycling through the unit .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you could do it like multiply", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "until you get crazy and decide to stop cycling through that unit .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "yo - you , there 's al also the user interface that 's missing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's missing from all of our offices ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that is some analog input like this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's what audio people actually use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's something that wh when you move your hand further , the sound goes faster past it ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like fast forward .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or , you could wire mouse or trackball to do something like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "why , that 's", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's not something wanted to have happen .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "no , but 'm saying if this is what professionals who actually do this thing for for video or for audio where you need to do this ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so you get very good at jostling back and forth , rather than hitting tab , and backspace , and carriage return , and enter , and things like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we talked about things like foot pedals and other analog", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , tho those are things we could do", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how much it 's worth doing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we 're just gonna have", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they they have several options .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , , , mentioned the looping option .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "another option is it 'll pause when it reaches the end of the boundary .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then to get to the next boundary you just press tab", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and it goes on to the next unit .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's very nicely thought out .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and also it 'll go around the the , ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but 'm not if that 's the thing .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "anyway , you can so they thought about different ways of having windows that you work within ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and but so in terms of the con the conventions , then , , , , it 's strictly orthographic", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "which means with some provisions for , , , colloquial forms .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so if person said , \" cuz \" instead of \" because \" then put an apostrophe at the beginning of the word and then in

another issue .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "jane had comments like , to who the person was speaking to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "only when it was otherwise gonna be puzzling", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because he was in the other room talking .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but someone who , , was just the transcriber wouldn't have known that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or when dan said

it wasn't it didn't sound quite that rude .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but really , no , in the context if he can't hear what he 's saying", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but when you when you listen to it", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it was lot funnier if you were there though .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what it what happens is if you 're transcriber listening to it sounds like dan is just

saying , it can read", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it can read and write as many as you want ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's just that it", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but what if you wanna edit it

didn't go the whole route ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the the whole saved form the saved format and the internal format , all that , handles multiple speakers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's just there 's no user interface for specifying multiple any more than two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so your script solves doesn't it solve all our problems ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "cuz we 're always gonna wanna go through this preprocessing", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "assuming it works .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that works nicely cuz this so quick to enter .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so wouldn't wanna do it through the interface anyway adding which worry who the speaker was .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then , , let 's see what else .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "in terms of like the continuity of thought for transcriptions , it 's it isn't just words coming out ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's like there 's some purpose for an utterance .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and sometimes someone will do backchannel in the middle of it", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but you wanna show that it 's continued at later point .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so have have convention of putting like dash arrow just to indicate that this person 's utterance continues .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then when it , catches back up again then there 's an arrow dash ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then you have the opposite direction to indicate continuation of ones own utterance versus ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "sometimes we had the situation which is , which you which you get in conversations , of someone continuing someone else 's utterance ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and in that case did tilde arrow versus arrow tilde , to indicate that it was continuation", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "did equal arrow for the for the own for yourself things", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "cuz it 's the speakers the same .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then tilde arrow if it was different if different speaker , , con continuation .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but just , , the arrows showing continuation of thought .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then you could track whether it was the same speaker or not by knowing", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "at the end of this unit you 'd happened later .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and that was like this person continued", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and you 'd be able to look for the continuation .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but the only time that becomes ambiguous is if you have two speakers .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like , if you if you only have one person , if you only have one thought that 's continuing across particular time boundary , you just need one arrow at each end ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if it 's picked up by different speaker , it 's picked up by different speaker .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the time it becomes ambiguous if you have more than one speaker and that and they swap .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you have more than one thread going , then you then you need to know whether they were swapped or not .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how often does that happen do you think ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "hopefully not very much .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "didn't use it very often .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "especially for meetings .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if if you were just recording someone 's day , it would be impossible . ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you were trying to do remembrance agent .", "speaker":

"speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it depends on this box , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and actually , at the my plan is to only bring eight wires out of this box .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "thi - thi this box is one off deal .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that being the wiring box .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and , , it 's function is to to , , essentially wire converter to go from these little blue wires to these black wires ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "plus supply power to the microphones", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "cuz the he the , , cheap head mounteds all require low voltage .",

these , , ei eight cables .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "each of the blue wires ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but there are only four .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "an - and there 's only there 's only four slots that are , in the first version or the version we 're planning to build .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that was the whole issue with the led ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that you plug it in , the led comes on , and and you 're live .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then it comes on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see , see .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now the the subtle issue here is that tha haven't really figured out solution for this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , we it 'll have to be convention .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what happens if somebody unplugs this

"there will be certain amount of looking at cables has to be done if people , , rewire things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", we had that last time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but there are actually that , there 's an extra there 's mix out on the radio receiver ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so there are actually six xlr outs on the back of the radio receiver", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and only five cables going in ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "had the wrong five ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so ended up not recording one of the channels and recording the mix .", "speaker": "B"},

, powering system .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and was gonna do this very clever phantom power", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and decided couple days ago not to do it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so 'm ready to build it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which is to say , , the neighborhood of week to get the circuit board done .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the other thing 'd like to do is , do something about the set up", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that it 's little more presentable and organized .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and 'm 'm just not what that is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text":

wireless but would had what 's based on these", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it would cost", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "pc and peanuts .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "pc and two thousand dollars for the - to - .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that 's about cuz you wouldn't even need the mixer if you didn't have the", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ms cost lot .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but anyway you 'd save , on the seven or eight thousand for the for the wireless system .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so actually that might be attractive .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "move my thumb now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's idea .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's it 's to be thinking toward that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "like if we talked softer the disk lasts longer .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there 's speech compression program that works on things like this ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "cuz if the dynamic range is low it encodes it with fewer bits .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so most of the time no one 's talking", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it shortens it dramatically .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if you talk quieter , the dynamic range is lower and it will compress better .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it also helps if you talk in monotone .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "constant volume all the time .", "speaker": "D"},

you there 's problem structural problem with this though .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you really need an incentive at the end if you 're gonna do digits again .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like , , candy bars ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'ll 'll remember to bring and 's next time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or or little , , toothbrushes like they give you at the dentist .", "speaker": "D"},

that for ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "should have mentioned that , to pause between lines but", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , know .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'m just giving you hard time .",

you meant microphone four .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and that 's mistake .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so eric , you win .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the other thing is that there 's there 's colon for transcripts .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and there shouldn't be colon .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because see , everything else is you fill in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's been filled in for you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but they 're in order !", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they start , six , seven , eight , nine , zero , one , two , three , four , five , six , eight , nine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "where 'd they come from ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and they 're in order because they 're sorted lexically by the file names , which are have the numbers in digits .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so they 're actually this is like all the all utterances that were generated by speaker mpj .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then within mpj they 're sorted by what he actually said .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "didn't know that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should have randomized it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it doesn't matter !",
