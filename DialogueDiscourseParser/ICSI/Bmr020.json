how you measure it ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but still it 's , the difference between between that number and what we have in meetings ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "which is more like , , close to in meetings like these , , close to twenty percent .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but what was it like , say , in the robustness meeting , ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it was about half of the", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so , in terms of number of words , it 's like seventeen or eigh eighteen percent for the meeting recorder meetings and about half that for , , the robustness .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but if that 's really fair way of comparing between , multi - party , conversations and two - party conversations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then then you have to", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's just something", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wonder if you have to normalize by the numbers of speakers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then , then normalize by something like that ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's good point .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we didn't get to look at that ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but this obvious thing to see if there 's dependence

everybody talks .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you have lot of lot of two - party , subsets within the meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's an interesting result regardless .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , that 's .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and and then and we also computed this both with and without backchannels ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so you might think that backchannels have special status because they 're essentially just", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so , did we all said \" - \" and nodded at the same time ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , even if you take out all the backchannels", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so you treat backchannels as nonspeech , as pauses ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "you still have significant overlap .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it goes down from for switchboard it goes down from fourteen percent of the words to , eleven percent", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's it 's not dramatic change ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that was that was one set of results ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and then the second one was just the we had in the in the hlt paper on how overlaps effect the recognition performance .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and we rescored things , little bit more carefully .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we also fixed the transcripts in numerous ways .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but mostly we added one number , which was", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "what if you , score ignoring all", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so so the conjecture from the hlt results was that most of the added recognition error is from insertions due to background speech .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so , we scored all the recognition results , , in such way that the", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "who 's on channel four ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you 're getting lot of breath .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was just wondering .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's me .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "don 's been working hard .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so if you have the foreground speaker speaking here , and then there 's some background speech , may be overlapping it somehow ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and this is the time bin that we used ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "then you 're gonna get insertion errors here and here .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so we scored everything ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and must say the nist scoring tools are pretty for this ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "where you just ignore everything outside of the , , region that was deemed to be foreground speech .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and where that was we had to use the forced alignment , , results from for", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 's somewhat that 's somewhat subject to error ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but still we , don did some ha hand - checking", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and we think that based on that , we think that the results are , valid ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "although , some error is gonna be in there .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but what we found is after we take out these regions so we only score the regions that were certified as foreground speech , the recognition error went down to almost , the level of the non - overlapped speech .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so that means that even if you do have background speech , if you can somehow separate out or find where it is , , the recognizer does good job ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "even though there is this back", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that doesn't surprise me ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because , with the close - talking mikes , the signal will be so much stronger .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what what normalization do you do ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", we just @ @ we do , vit", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "in you recognizer ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in the sri recognizer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we do , vtl vocal tract length normalization ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and we , we , make all the features have zero mean and unit variance .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "over an entire utterance ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "over over the entire over the entire channel .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "now we didn't re - align the recognizer for this .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we just took the old", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so this is actually sub - optimal way of doing it ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so we took the old recognition output", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and we just scored it differently .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so the recognizer didn't have the benefit of knowing where the foreground speech start", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "were you including the lapel in this ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and did the did the la did the problems with the lapel go away also ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "fray for insertions ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it not per , not completely ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so we have to", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "should bring the should bring the table with results .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we can look at it monday .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "would presume that you still would have somewhat higher error with the lapel for insertions than", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's it 's", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "cuz again , looking forward to the non - close miked case , that we still", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "'m not looking forward to it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's the high signal - to - noise ratio", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "here that helps you .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so that was number that was the second set of , the second section .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and then , the third thing was , we looked at , , what we call \" interrupts \" ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "although that 's that may be misnomer ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but we looked at cases where", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so we used the punctuation from the original transcripts", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and we inferred the beginnings and ends of sentences .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "di - did you use upper - lower case also , or not ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "upper lower case or no ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we only used , , periods , , question marks and exclamation .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and we know that there 's that 's not very", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we miss lot of them ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "comma also or not ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then we looked at locations where ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "if you have overlapping speech and someone else starts sentence , , where do these where do other people start their turns not turns really , but , sentences ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so we only looked at cases where there was foreground speaker", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and then at the to at the so the foreground speaker started into their sentence and then someone else started later .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "somewhere in between the start and the end ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "somewhere in between the start and the end of the foreground ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that such that there was overlap between the two sentences .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so , the question was how can we what can we say about the places where the second or actually , several second speakers , start their \" interrupts \" , as we call them .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "three words from the end .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "at pause boundaries .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we looked at this in terms of", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "on - closures , only .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so so we had we had", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "to for the purposes of this analysis , we tagged the word sequences , and we time - aligned them .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and we considered it interrupt if it occurred in the middle of word ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we , considered that to be interrupt as if it were at the beginning of the word .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so that , if any part of the word was overlapped , it was considered an interrupted word .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and then we looked at the locatio the , , , the features that the tags", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "because we had tagged these word strings , , that occurred before these , interrupt locations .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and the tags we looked at are the spurt tag ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "end of spurt .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so whether there was pause essentially here ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "because spurts are defined as being , five hundred milliseconds or longer pauses ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and then we had things like discourse markers ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so disfluen the 's are for , , the interruption points of disfluency ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so , where you hesitate , or where you start the repair there .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "what else do we had .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "repeated , repeated words is another of that disfluencies and .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so we had both the beginnings and ends of these", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so , the end of filled pause", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and the end of discourse marker .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and we just eyeballed", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we didn't really hand - tag all of these things .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we just looked at the distribution of words ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and so every \" so \" , and \" \" , , and \" - \" were the were deemed to be backchannels", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and \" \" and \" so \" and \" \" , were not \" \" . \" \" is backchannel .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but so , we just based on the lexical , identity of the words , we tagged them as one of these things .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and the the interruption points we got from the original transcripts .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and then we looked at the disti", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so we looked at the distribution of these different kinds of tags , overall", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and and particularly at the interruption points .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and , we found that there is marked difference", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so at the end after discourse marker or after backchannel or after filled pause , you 're much more likely to be interrupted than before .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and also after spurt ends ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "which means in inside pauses .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so pauses are always an opportunity for", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so we have this little histogram which shows these distributions", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's it 's not no big surprises ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but it is interesting from", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's to actually measure it though .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wonder about the and effect there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in other words if you weren't going to pause you will because you 're being interrupted .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there 's no statement about and effect .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is just statistical correlation ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but he , he 's he 's ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "you weren't intending to pause ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but you were intending to stop for fifty - seven milliseconds ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but then chuck came in", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and so you paused for second", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "anyway . so ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and that was it .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and and we so we wrote this", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and then , we found we were at six pages ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and then we started cutting furiously", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and threw out half of the material again ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and played with the latex", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "made the font smaller and the narrows longer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and until it fi", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "you couldn't really make everything smaller", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "put the abstract end .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we we put", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "took out white space .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the gap between the two columns is like ten millimeters ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so shrunk it to eight millimeters", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and that helped some . and like that .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "wasn't there wasn't there some result , andreas", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "liz presented this at some conference while ago about , backchannels", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that they tend to happen when the pitch drops .", "speaker": "D"},

listens for these drops in pitch and gives them the backchannel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so then you hook that to the phone and go off", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and do the do whatever you wanna do ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "while that thing keeps them busy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there 's actually there 's this former student of here from berkeley ,", "speaker": "G"},

{"text": "so it 's \" ftp pub", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "what is it again ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "ask dan ellis .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the same the same as the mailing list ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "the no vowels .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and then under there", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "actually and this directory , is not readable .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's only , accessible .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so , in other words , to access anything under there , you have to be told what the name is .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so that 's quick and dirty way of doing access control .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and the directory for this call it \" asr zero point one \"", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "because it 's meant for recognition .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so anyone who hears this meeting now knows the", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and then in there have file that lists all the other files ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so that someone can get that file and then know the file names and therefore download them .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "if you the file names you can't", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "is that dash or dot in there ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "don't don't say .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so all all was gonna do there was stick the transcripts after we the way that we munged them for scoring ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "because that 's what he cares about ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and also and then the waveforms that don segmented .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "just tar them all up for each meeting tar them all into one tar file and - zip them and stick them there .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "put digits in my own home directory home ftp directory ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but 'll probably move them there as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we could point mari to this also for her march - one request ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "march - one .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "you remember she was", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "she wanted that also ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "she was saying that it would be if we had they had", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or was she talking", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "she was saying it would be if they had the same set ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that when they did experiments they could compare .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but they don't have recognizer even .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we can send cc mari on this so that she knows", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so , for the thing that", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we need to give brian the beeps file ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so was gonna probably put it", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can put it in the same place .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just put in another directory .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'ll make another directory .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "make ano make another directory .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and , andreas , , sampled ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so either we should regenerate the original versions , or , we should just make note of it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because in one directory there 's two versions .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 's the first meeting cut both versions .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "just to check which if there is significant difference .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so but for the other meetings it 's the downsampled version that you have .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "they 're all downsampled ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's important to know ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we should probably give them the non - downsampled versions .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "alright , then 'll hold off on that and 'll for you", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "'ll send you an email .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "definitely they should have the full bandwidth version ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "because liz decided to go ahead with the downsampled versions cuz we can there was no like , significant difference .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it takes it takes up less disk space , for one thing .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it does take up less disk space ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and it did even better than the original versions ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "which , is just , probably random .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it was small difference", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but , they probably want the originals .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's good thing that", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we 're losing , don and andreas at three - thirty ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "mon hafta booga .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's why it was good to have andreas , say these things", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , we should probably talk about the ibm transcription process that", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so , that adam created , script to generate the beep file ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to then create something to send to ibm .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you should probably talk about that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but but you were gonna to use the originally transcribed file", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because tightened the time bins", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that 's also the one that they had already in trying to debug the first stage of this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "my understanding was that ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "haven't haven't listened to it yet ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it sounded very good", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and understand that you were going to have meeting today , before this meeting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it was just to talk about how to generate it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just so that while 'm gone , you can regenerate it if you decide to do it different way .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , chuck and thilo should , now more or less know how to generate the file", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , the other thing chuck pointed out is that , , since this one is hand - marked , there are discourse boundaries .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so so when one person is speaking , there 's breaks .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "whereas thilo 's won't have that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what we 're probably gonna do is just write script , that if two , chunks are very close to each other on the same channel we 'll just merge them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , , and that will get around the problem of , the , \" one word beep , one word beep , one word beep \" .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "after our meeting , this morning thilo came in and said that , there could be other differences between the already transcribed meeting with the beeps in it and one that has just been run through his process .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that 's the purpose .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so tomorrow , when we go to make the , chunked file for ibm , we 're going to actually compare the two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so he 's gonna run his process on that same meeting ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then we 're gonna do the beep - ify on both , and listen to them and see if we notice any real differences .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "beep - ify !", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "now one thing that prevented us from apply you from applying", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that is the training meeting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we know that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "wel - we just wanna if there 're any major differences between doing it on the hand", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this training meeting , un is that some data where we have very , , accurate time marks ? for", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "went back and hand - marked the ba the bins ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ment mentioned that last week .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the but there 's , but there is this one issue with them in that there 're there are time boundaries in there that occur in the middle of speech .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like when we went to", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "when was listening to the original file that adam had , it 's like you hear word then you hear beep and then you hear the continuation of what is the same sentence .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's on the other channel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's because of channel overlap .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so there are these chunks that look like that have", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's not gonna be true of the foreground speaker .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 'll only be if it 's the background speaker .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you 'll you 'll have chunk of , , channel which starts at zero and ends at ten ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then the same channel starting at eleven ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ending at fifteen ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then again , starting at sixteen ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ending at twenty .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that 's three chunks where actually we can just make one chunk out of that", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which is , zero , twenty .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's what said ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so wanted to make that it was clear .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if you were to use these , you have to be careful not to pull out these individual", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what would was interested in is having se having time marks for the beginnings and ends of speech", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "by each speaker .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 's definitely problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because we could use that to fine tune our alignment process", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "to make it more accurate .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it don't care that , there 's actually abutting segments that we have to join together .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 's fine .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but what we do care about is that the beginnings and ends are actually close to the speech inside of that", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "jane tightened these up by hand .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what is the how tight are they ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it looks much better .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "they were , , reasonably tight , but not excruciatingly tight .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that would 've taken more time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wanted to get it so tha so that if you have like \" \" in swimming in big bin , then it 's", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , no !", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "let me make note on yours .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because we don't want to", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 's perfectly fine .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's good .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "you always want to have little bit of pause or nonspeech around the speech , say for recognition purposes .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but just get an id wanted to have an idea of the of how much extra you allowed", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so that interpret the numbers if compared that with forced alignment segmentation .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "'t answer that ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but my main goal was , in these areas where you have three - way overlap and one of the overlaps involves \" \" , and it 's swimming in this huge bin , wanted to get it so that it was clo more closely localized .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but are we talking about , , tenth of second ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "how how much extra would you allow at most", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "wanted it to be able to he be heard normally ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that if you if you play back that bin and have it in the mode where it stops at the boundary , it sounds like normal word .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it doesn't sound like the person", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it sounds normal .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's as if the person could 've stopped there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it wouldn't have been an awkward place to stop .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now sometimes , it 's these are involved in places where there was no time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so , there wouldn't be gap afterwards because", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "some cases , there 're some people , who have very long segments of discourse where , , they 'll they 'll breath and then put break .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but other than that , it 's really pretty continuous", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and this includes things like going from one sentence into the one utterance into the next , one sentence into the next ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "without really stopping .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in writing you have this two spaces and big gap", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but but some people are planning", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , , , lot we always are planning what we 're going to say next .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , in which case , the gap between these two complete syntactic units , , which spoken things are not always complete syntactically ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it would be shorter shorter break than you might like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the goal there was to not have the text be so crudely parsed in time bin .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because from discourse purpose it 's it 's more useful to be able to see", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also , from speech recognition purpose my impression is that if you have too long unit , it 's it doesn't help you very much either ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "cuz of the memory .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's fine .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so , that means that the amount of time after something is variable depending partly on context ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but my general goal when there was sufficient space , room , pause after it to have it be natural feeling gap .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which what it would be quantified as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wally chafe says that , in producing narratives , the spurts that people use tend to be , , that the what would be pause might be something like two seconds .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , that would be , one speaker .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the discourse the people who look at turn taking often do use", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was interested that you chose , , the that you use", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "cuz that 's unit that would be more consistent with sociolinguistics .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we chose , , half second", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "because if you go much larger , you have , your statement about how much overlap there is becomes less , , precise ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "because you include more of actual pause time into what you consider overlap speech .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's compromise ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": ", also used something around zero point five seconds for the speech - nonspeech detector", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it 's also based", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "liz suggested that value based on the distribution of pause times that you see in switchboard and other corpora .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "for the minimum silence length .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in any case , this , meeting that hand", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "hand - adjusted two of them", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and sent sent email ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so so at some point we will try to fine - tune our forced alignment", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and sent the path .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "using those as references", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "because , what you would do is you would play with different parameters .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and to get an object you need an objective measure of how closely you can align the models to the actual speech .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and that 's where your data would be very important to have .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and hopefully the new meetings which will start from the channelized version will have better time boundaries and alignments .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but like this idea of , for our purposes for the for the ibm preparation , , having these joined together ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it makes lot of sense .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and in terms of transcription , it would be easy to do it that way .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the way that they have with the longer units ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not having to fuss with adding these units at this time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "whi - which could have one drawback . if there is backchannel in between those three things ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the the backchannel will occur at the end of those three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and and in the in the previous version where in the which is used now , there , the backchannel would be in - between there somewhere ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would be more natural", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's that 's ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , thi this brings me to the other stage of this which discussed with you earlier today ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which is the second stage is , what to do in terms of the transcribers adjustment of these data .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "discussed this with you too .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the idea initially was , we would get , for the new meetings ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the edu meetings , that thilo ha has now presegmented all of them for us , on channel by channel basis .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , 've assigned 've assigned them to our transcribers", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so far 've discussed it with one ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and had about an hour discussion with her about this yesterday ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we went through edu - one , at some extent .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it occurred to me that that what we have in this format is you could consider it as staggered mixed file ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we had some discussion over the weekend about at this other meeting that we were all at", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "about whether the tran the ibm transcribers should hear single channel audio , or mixed channel audio .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , in way , by having this chunk and then the backchannel after it , it 's like stagal staggered mixed channel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , it occurred to me in my discussion with her yesterday that ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the the maximal gain , it 's from the ibm people , may be in long stretches of connected speech .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it 's whole bunch of words which they can really do , because of the continuity within that person 's turn .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , what 'm thinking , and it may be that not all meetings will be good for this , but what 'm thinking is that in the edu meetings , they tend to be driven by couple of dominant speakers .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , if the chunked files focused on the dominant speakers , then , when it got patched together when it comes back from ibm , we can add the backchannels .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it seems to me that , , the backchannels per - se wouldn't be so hard ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then there 's this question of the time @ @ , marking , and whether the beeps would be", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and 'm not exactly how that how that would work with the with the backchannels .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and certainly things that are intrusions of multiple words , taken out of context and displaced in time from where they occurred , that would be hard .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , my thought is 'm having this transcriber go through the edu - one meeting , and indicate start time {nonvocalsound} for each dominant speaker , endpoi end time for each dominant speaker ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the idea that these units would be generated for the dominant speakers , and not for the other channels .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the only , , disadvantage of that is , then it 's hard to use an automatic method to do that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the advantage is that it 's probably faster to do that than it is to use the automated method and correct it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we 'll just have to see .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", the original plan was that the transcriber would adjust the the boundaries , and all that for all the channels", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , , that is so time - consuming ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and since we have bottleneck here , we want to get ibm things that are usable as soon as possible ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then this seemed to me it 'd be way of gett to get them flood of data ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which would be useful when it comes back to us .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also , at the same time she when she goes through this , she 'll be if there 's anything that was encoded as pause , but really has something transcribable in it , then she 's going to , make mark", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , so that bin would be marked as it as double dots", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and she 'll just add an .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and in the other in the other case , if it 's marked as speech , and really there 's nothing transcribable in it , then she 's going to put dash ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and 'll go through and it and , , with with substitution command , get it so that it 's clear that those are the other category .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'ll just , , recode them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , , the transcribable events that , 'm considering in this , , continue to be laugh , as as speech , and cough and things like that ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so 'm not stripping out anything ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just , being very lenient in what 's considered speech .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in terms of the this new procedure you 're suggesting , , what is the", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's not that different .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so 'm little confused ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because how do we know where to put beeps ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is it is it", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "transcriber will do it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what it what it involves is really , , the original pr procedure ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but only applied to , certain strategically chosen aspect of the data .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we pick the easy parts of the data ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and transcriber marks it by hand .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you got it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but after we 've done thilo 's thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "didn't didn't understand that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'m @ @ now 'm confused .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we start with your presegmented version", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and 'm leaving .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "have to go as .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "leave the mikes on ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and just put them on the table .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we start with the presegmented version", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let me mark you as no digits .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you start with the presegmentation ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then , the transcriber , instead of going painstakingly through all the channels and moving the boundaries around , and deciding if it 's speech or not , but not transcribing anything .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "instead of doing that , which was our original plan , the tra they focus on the dominant speaker", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they just do that on the main channels .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what they do is they identify who 's the di dominant speaker , and when the speaker starts .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , you 're still gonna", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's based on your se presegmentation ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's the basic thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you just use the the segments of the dominant speaker then ? for for sending to ibm", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , now jane , my question is when they 're all done adjusting the time boundaries for the dominant speaker , have they then also erased the time boundaries for the other ones ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no . no , no .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so how will we know who", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's that 's why she 's notating the start and end points of the dominant speakers .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , on , so in edu - one , as far as listened to it , you start off with section by jerry .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so jerry starts at minute so - and - so ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and goes until minute so - and - so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then mark paskin comes in .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and he starts at minute such - and - such ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and goes on till minute so - and - so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then meanwhile , she 's listening to both of these ' channels ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "determining if there 're any cases of misclassification of speech as nothing , and nothing as speech ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and and adding tag if that happens .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so she does the adjustments on those ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , wanted to say , his segmentation is so good , that , the part that listened to with her yesterday didn't need any adjustments of the bins .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on that meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so far we haven't .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is not gonna be major part of the process ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "at least not in not on ones that really", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if you don't have to adjust the bins , why not just do what it for all the channels ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "why not just throw all the channels to ibm ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there 's the question of whether", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "she it 's question of how much time we want our transcriber to invest here when she 's gonna have to invest that when it comes back from ibm anyway .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if it 's only inserting \" - \"s here and there , then , wouldn't that be something that would be just as efficient to do at this end , instead of having it go through , then be patched together , then be double checked here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then we could just use the output of the detector , and do the beeping on it , and send it to", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "without having her check anything .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we just we just have to listen to it and see how good they are .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for some meetings , 'm 'm it", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'m 'm open to that ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it 's working ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that 's and some on some meetings it 's good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that sounds like good idea", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "since as you say you have to do with the other end anyway .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the detector , this", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have to fix it when it comes back anyhow .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now , you were saying that they differ in how they work depending on channel sys systems and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we should perhaps just select meetings on which the speech - nonspeech detection works ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but edu is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and just use , those meetings to to send to ibm and , do the other ones .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "release to begin with .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what 's the problem the forget .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "is the problem the
