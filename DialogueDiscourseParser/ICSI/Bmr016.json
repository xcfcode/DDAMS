,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so it 's it 's really pretty different .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but the idea of using set thing was just to give you some framework ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so that even though you couldn't do exact comparisons , it wouldn't be valid scientifically at least it 'd give you some frame of reference .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "liz , what what do the

time .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and they can have ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "actually , things are getting longer and longer .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "in the old days you probably only had three sequences , and telephone numbers were less , and .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so , there 's between ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "if you look at it , there are between like three and five groups ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and each one has between two and four groupings", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "purposely didn't want them to look like they were in any pattern .", "speaker":

.", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "no , 'm serious ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "all we have for some people is digits .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we have problem with acoustic adaptation ,",

do we have any prefer preference on which way we wanna we wanna go ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was actually gonna skip the asr results part , in favor of getting the transcription talked about", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "since that 's more important to moving forward ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but morgan has this paper copy", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and if people have questions ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's pretty preliminary in terms of asr results", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "because we didn't do anything fancy ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but just having the results there ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and pointing out some main conclusions", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "like it 's not the speaking style that differs ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's the fact that there 's overlap that causes recognition errors .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and then , the fact that it 's almost all insertion errors ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "which you would expect", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but you might also think that in the overlapped regions you would get substitutions and ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "leads us to believe that doing better segmentation , like your channel - based segmentation , or some , echo cancellation to get back down to the individual speaker utterances would be probably all that we would need to be able to do good recognition on the on the close - talking mikes .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "why don't you , if you have hard copy , why don't you email it to the list .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , that 's about the summary", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but this is morgan has this paper .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's in the paper .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it 's the same thing ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's the same thing mailed to every everybody that where it was ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's that paper .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "then , it 's already been mailed .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , we , , did lot of work on that", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "let 's see ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "the other neat thing is it shows for that the lapel , within speaker is bad .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and it 's bad because it picks up the overlapping speech .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so , your asr results were run on the channels synchronized ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , cuz that 's all that had been transcribed at the time ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but as we wanted to here more about the transcription .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "if we can get the channel asynchronous or the", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that would be very interesting for us", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 's that 's why only used the part from use", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "which we had about the alt over all the channels", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "rather mixed signal .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so if there was segment of speech this long", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and and someone said \" , \" the whole thing was passed to the recognizer ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and someone said \" \" in the front in the middle .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there were several speakers in it ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's . pulled out couple classic examples in case you wanna use them in your talk of", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 's why there 's so many insertion errors ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "chuck on the lapel ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so chuck wore the lapel three out of four times .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "noticed that chuck was wearing the lapel lot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "early on , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and wore the lapel once ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and for me the lapel was .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "probably how you wear it wore it would .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for you it was", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "or who was next to me like that .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "where you were sitting probably affected it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but when chuck wore the lapel and morgan was talking there 're couple really long utterances", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "where chuck is saying few things inside ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and it 's picking up all of morgan 's words pretty", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and so the rec , there 're error rates", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "insertions aren't bounded ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so with one - word utterance and ten insertions you got huge error rate .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and that 's that 's where the problems come in .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so this is what we expected ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but it 's to be able to show it .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and also wanted to mention briefly that , , andreas and called up dan ellis who 's still stuck in switzerland ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and we were gonna ask him if there 're , what 's out there in terms of echo cancellation and things like that .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "not that we were gonna do it ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but we wanted to would need to be done .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and he said , \" lots lots . \"", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and he we 've given him the data we have so far ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so these sychronous cases where there are overlap .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and he 's gonna look into trying to run some things that are out there", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and see how it can do", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "because now we 're not able to actually report on recognition in real paper ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "like eurospeech paper ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "because it would look premature .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so the idea is that you would take this big hunk where somebody 's only speaking small amount in it ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then try to figure out where they 're

would you do that automatically ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'ve actually done some experiments with cross - correlation", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it seems to work pretty to get rid of those overlaps ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's the thing that you would do .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "exactly , so it 's it 's", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so why do you want to do echo cancellation ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it would be techniques used from adaptive echo cancellation", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "which enough about to talk about .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it just it just to to remove cross - talk .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": ", and that would be similar to what you 're also trying to do ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but using , , more than energy", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "what exactly would go into it .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so it would be", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the idea is to run this on the whole meeting .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and get the locations , which gives you also the time boundaries of the individual speak", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so do what he 's already what he 's trying to do .", "speaker": "B"},

{"text": "may also be working", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so it would just be ver", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 's really the next step", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "because we can't do too much , , on term in terms of recognition results knowing that this is big problem", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "until we can do that processing .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and so , once we have some of yours ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "'m working on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and @ @ we 'll move on .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "this also ties into one of the things that jane is gonna talk about too .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "also wanted to say have done all this chopping up of digits ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "- . - .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so have some naming conventions that we should try to agree on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so let 's do that off - line ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we don't need to do it during the meeting .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and and have scripts that will extract it out from \" key \" files", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and do all the naming automatically ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you don't have to do it by hand .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you 've compiled the list of , , speaker names ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that 's it for the", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "names in the names to ds ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it does all sorts of matches", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because the way people filled out names is different on every single file", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it does very fuzzy match .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so at this point we can finalize the naming , and ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and we 're gonna re rewrite out these waveforms that we did", "speaker":

"speaker": "G"}, {"text": "then disregard it then .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so now have script that you can just say look up morgan ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it will give you his id .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don , you had disk space and storage formats .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is that something we need to talk about at the meeting ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or should you just talk with chuck at some other time ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "had some general questions just about the compression algorithms of shortening waveforms", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and exactly who to ask .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that you would be the person to talk to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , is it lossless compression when you compress ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it just uses entropy coding ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , , my question would be is", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "got this new eighteen gig drive installed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and assume half of it is scratch and half of it is ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'m not exactly how they partitioned it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's typical , .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "what 's typical here ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's local though ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that doesn't matter .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can access it from anywhere in icsi .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how do you do that ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is an eighteen gig drive , or is it thirty six gig drive with eighteen", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "eigh - eighteen .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it was spare that dave had around", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "slash slash machine name , slash in all likelihood .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright , did know that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the only question is how much of it", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the distinction between scratch and non - scratch is whether it 's backed up or not .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what you wanna do is use the scratch for that you can regenerate .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the that isn't backed up is not big deal", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because disks don't crash very frequently ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as long as you can regenerate it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "all of this can be regenerated ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's just question", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then put it all on scratch", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because we 're icsi is bottlenecked by backup .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "- , very good point .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so we wanna put", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'d leave all the all the transcript shouldn't should be backed up ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but all the waveform sound files should not be backed up ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "the ones that you write out .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so , , the other question was then , should we shorten them , downsample them , or keep them in their original form ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it just depends on your tools .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because it 's not backed up and it 's just on scratch , if your sc tools can't take shortened format , would leave them expanded ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you don't have to unshorten them every single time you wanna do anything .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can downsample them ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "do you think that 'd be ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to downsample them ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we get the same performance .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "the the front - end on the sri recognizer just downsamples them on the fly ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "the only argument against downsampling is to preserve just the original files in case we want to experiment with different filtering techniques .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "over all our data , we want to not downsample .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "you 'd you wanna not .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so we 're what we 're doing is we 're writing out", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "this is just question .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we 're writing out these individual segments , that wherever there 's time boundary from thilo , or jane 's transcribers , , we chop it there .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and the reason is so that we can feed it to the recognizer ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and throw out ones that we 're not using and .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and those are the ones that we 're storing .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "as said , since that 's it 's regeneratable , what would do is take downsample it ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and compress it however you 're the sri recognizer wants to take it in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we can't shorten them ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but we can downsample them .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "as , as long as there is form that we can come from again , that is not downsampled , then ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "those are gonna be kept .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that that 's why we need more disk space", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "cuz we 're duplicating the originals ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "then it 's fine .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but for fu future research we 'll be doing it with different microphone positions and so on", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "no . we always have the original long ones .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we would like to", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so the sri front - end won't take an large audio file name and then list of segments to chop out from that large audio file ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they actually have to be chopped out already ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's better if they 're chopped out ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and it will be", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we could probably write something to do that ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but it 's actually convenient to have them chopped out", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "cuz you can run them , , in different orders .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "you you can actually move them around .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and that 's the whole point about the naming conventions", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can get rid of", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "is that you could run all the english speaking ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's lot faster .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "all the native speakers ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and all the non - native speakers ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can grab everything with the word \" the \" in it ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and all the men , and all the women .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's lot quicker than actually trying to access the wavefile each time ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "find the time boundaries and", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so in principle , , you could do that ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "don't don't think that 's really .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "\" that 's just not , man . \"", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these are long these are long", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so so , what if you wanted to run all the native speakers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is an hour of speech .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so if you did it that way you would have to generate program that looks in the database somewhere ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "extracts out the language ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "finds the time - marks for that particular one ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do it that way .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the way they 're doing it , you have that already extracted", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it 's embedded in the file name .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so , , you just say", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we - that 's so that 's part of it", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so you just say \" asterisk asterisk dot wave \" , and you get what you want .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the other part is just that once they 're written out it is lot faster to process them .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "rather than doing seeks through the file .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "otherwise , you 're just accessing", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "this is all just temporary access ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so don't it 's all just", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's fine .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fine to do it however is convenient .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it just depends how big the file is .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "if the file sits in memory you can do extremely fast seeks", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the other thing is that , believe it or not , we have some", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and they don't .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we 're also looking at these in waves like for the alignments and .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "you can't load an hour of speech into waves .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "you need to have these small files ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and , even for the transcriber program", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "yes you can .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can give waves start and an end time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you try to load really

- wise on", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it - it 's lot slower to load in long file ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "seemed really fast .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and also to check the file ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so if you have transcript , ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "regardless , it 's", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "overall you could get everything to work by accessing the same

"do these checks .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and so , , do an exhaustive listing of the forms", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "actually , will go through this in order ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so if we could and stick keep that for second", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "cuz we 're not ready for that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so on the fifth page , seven down", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", . exactly ! exactly !", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "alright so , spelling check first", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "then an exhaustive listing of the , all the forms in the data with the punctuation attached", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and at that point pick up things like , , , word followed by two commas .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and and then another check involves , , being that every

,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so that was part of the spell - check , or was that was after the spell - check ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so when get the exhau", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so the spell - check picks up those words", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because they 're not in the dictionary .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so it gets \" cuz \" and \" wanna \" and that", "speaker": "E"},

"we are acronym - loaded .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can ask question about the glossing , before we go on ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so , for word like \" because \" is it that it 's always

"speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'m still doing the overview .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "haven't actually gotten here yet .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so , gloss is things like replacing the full form

"speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and some of them are laughs and breathes ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so we have that 's prepended with tag of \" voc \" .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and the non - vocal ones are like door - slams and tappings ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and that 's prepended with no non - vocalization .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so then it just an ending curly brace there ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or is there something else in there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let 's just take one example .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then the no non - vocalization would be something like door - slam .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "they always end .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so it 's like they 're paired curly brackets .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then the third type now , , is things that fall in the category of comments about what 's happening .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so it could be something like , , \" referring to so - and - so \" ,", "speaker":

argument could be made for this tur turning that into qualitative statement", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because it 's talking about the thing that preceded it ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but at present we haven't been , , , coding the exact scope of laughing , ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and so to have \" while laughing \" , that it happened somewhere in there", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "which could mean that it occurred separately and following ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "or , , including some of the utterances to the left .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "haven't been awfully

these can be changed , like said .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": ", as said was considering changing it to \" digits \" .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and , it just , it 's just matter of deciding on

know for .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and we can also do counts on them without having to do the processing .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but you 're ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we could do it this way ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it should work .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and it makes it the thing about", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it 's probably not hard for person to tell the difference", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "because one 's in the context of , transcribed word string ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "the other thing is you can get really so minute with these things", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and increase the size of the files and the re and decrease the readability to such an extent by simply something like \" percent \" .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "now could

processing ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we start like branching off into the our layer of transcripts .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the problem the problem is that some of the adjustments that they 're making are to bring are to combine bins that were time bins which were previously separate .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and the reason they do that is sometimes there 's word that 's cut off .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and so , it 's true that it 's likely to be adjusted in the way that the words are more complete .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "no know that adjusting those things are gonna is gonna make it better .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it 's gonna be more reliable thing", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "'m about that ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but do you have like

doubt it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so now the what you 're doing is you 're taking the , the original version", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you 're channelizing yourself , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'m doing it myself .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if the time markings aren't different across channels ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like the channelized version really doesn't have any

that , , when we make this first general version and then start working on the script , that script @ @ that will be ma primarily come from what you 've done , , we 'll need to work on channelized

"except for the one that they 've already tightened the boundaries on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then probably what will happen is as the transcribers finish tightening more and more , , that
