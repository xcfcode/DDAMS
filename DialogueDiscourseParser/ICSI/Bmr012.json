"speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that 's not good .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so that 's what we have", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that will be completely gone if this synch time problem", "speaker":

seen the email ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what was the score ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so here 's the actual copy of the email", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should say something about the glitch .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "he he can say something about the glitch .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "cuz it 's it 's it 's it 's very small", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so does this glitch occur at other", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there there 's an acoustic glitch that occurs where the channels get slightly asynchronized", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so the that problem has gone away in the original driver believe it or not when the ssh key gen ran the driver paused for fraction of second", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and so the channels get little asynchronous", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and so if you listen to it in the middle there 's little part where it starts doing click sounds .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and is it only once that happens ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "once in the middle .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "there 's the previous page has some more information about what was wrong", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so un unsurprisingly adam is the golden voice ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that shouldn't affect anything", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so that 's actually", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you see this here ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what happens is it actually affects the script that don", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we know about it then it could always be checked for it", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the acoustic one shouldn't do anything .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "exactly what affected it", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but 'll 'll talk to you about it ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "'ll show you the point .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it it had no effect on my transcription ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "had no trouble hearing it and having time bins", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "do remember seeing once the transcriber produce an incorrect xml file where one of the synch numbers was incorrect .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the synch time the synch numbers have more significant digits than they should ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's what happened .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "where where they weren't monotonic .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "there 's things that are in smaller increments than frame .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so then , you look at that and it 's got more than three significant digits in synch time then that can't be", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so anyway it 's it 's just", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "sounds like bug .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's why we only have twenty minutes", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but there 's significant amount of", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "non - zero ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "there are like more cuz there 's lot of zeros tacked on just because of the way the script ran ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "the other one saw was that it", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but there were there was point .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that was fine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that that was .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the other one saw was non - monotonic synch times", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and that definitely indicra indicates bug .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that would really be problem ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so anyway these are just the ones that are the prebug for one meeting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and what 's which", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that 's very encouraging .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "this is really encouraging cuz this is free recognition ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 's no the language model for switchboard is different", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you can see some like this trent lott which", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "these are funny ones ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 'll get those though .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there 's lot of perfect ones and good ones and all the references ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can read them and when we get more results you can look through and see", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and as said would like to look at the lattices", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's pretty good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because it sounded like even the ones it got wrong it got it ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so we can generate", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are fair number of errors that are , where got the plural wrong or the inflection on the verb wrong .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and who cares ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and and there were lots the \" \" - , \" in on \" - \" of \" - .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "mmm , so if", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no those are actually", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "lot of the errors are out of vocabulary ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so is it like pzm is three words ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's pzm ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 's no language model for pzm or", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ri - ri .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "did you say there 's no language for pzm ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "no language model , those", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you mean so every time someone says pzm it 's an error ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we shouldn't say pzm in these meetings .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "there 's all kinds of other like jimlet", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's , jimlet .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we don't even that means ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so but this is really encouraging because", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , the bottom line is even though it 's not huge amount of data it should be reasonable to actually run recognition and be like within the scope of reasonable switchboard", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is like about how we do on switchboard - two data with the switchboard - one trained mostly trained recognizer", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and switchboard - two is got different population of speakers and different topic", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they 're talking about things in the news that happened after switchboard - one", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so there was @ @ so that 's .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we 're in better shape than we were say when we did had the ninety - three workshop", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we were all getting like seventy percent error on switchboard .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is really ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and to andreas who , this is", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "especially for the very first run , you", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the first run ran of switchboard got hundred twenty percent word error", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so and what al also this means is that", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 's bunch of things in this note to various people", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "especially with jane that would help for", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "since we have this new data now in order to go from the transcripts more easily to just the words that the recognizer would use for scoring .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "had to deal with some of it by hand but lot of it can be automated by", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one thing didn't get", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the language model was straight from bigram from switchboard", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the acoustic models were also from switchboard or", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so they didn't have anything from this acoustic data in yet ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's amazing .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so that 's .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and actually we actually used switchboard telephone bandwidth models", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's amazing .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 's those are the only we ones there are ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was just gonna say ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that 's the on that 's the only acoustic training data that we have lot of", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so guy at sri said that there 's not huge amount of difference going from", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's it 's not like we probably lose huge amount", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we won't know", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because we don't have any full band models for conversational speech .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's probably not as bad as going using full band models on telephone band speech", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it 's so", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but for broadcast news when we played around between the two there wasn't huge loss .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it was not big deal .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "should should say that the language model is not just switchboard", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that 's good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "although combining worked .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "there 's actually more data is from broadcast news", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but with little less weight", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like trent lott must have been from", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just for fun we also ran ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our complete system starts by doing ge gender detection", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so just for the heck of it ran that", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it said hundred percent male ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and it might be reassuring for everybody to know that it got all the genders .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's 'm glad .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it got all two genders ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but jane and adam have you kn about equal performance", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and and that 's interesting", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "cuz the their language models are quite different", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and 'm pretty from listening to eric that , given the words he was saying and given his pronunciation that the reason that he 's so much worse is the lapel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that makes lot of sense ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so it 's now if we can just eliminate the lapel one when we get new microphones", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would bet on that too", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would be worth it", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "cuz he certainly in that when as as burp user he was he was pretty strong one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "he he sounded to me just from he sounded like ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what 's it sheep or goat ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "sheep is good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so so the good news is that", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is without lot of the bells and whistles that we can do with the sri system", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we 'll have more data and we can also start to adapt the language models once we have enough meetings .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is only twenty minutes of one meeting with no tailoring .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "clearly there are with just small amount of actual meeting transcriptions thrown into the language model you can probably do quite bit better", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the voca the vocabulary especially", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or just dictionary .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "not that much the vocabulary actually", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to see", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's pretty good", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have to add pzm and so on", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and have to try it on the far field mike", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then there 's things like for the transcription got when someone has digit in the transcript if they said , one or eleven", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if they said tcl or tcl .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 's things like that where , the we 'll probably have to ask the transcribers to indicate some of those kinds of things", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but in general it was really good", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and this is this is good news", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because that means the force alignments should be good", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if the force alignments ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's good news anyway", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if the force alignments are good we can get all kinds of information .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "about , prosodic information", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and speaker overlaps and directly from the aligned times .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that 'll be something that", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "actually in order to assess the forced alignment we need some linguists or some people to look at it and say are these boundaries in about the place .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because it 's just gonna give us time marks", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we 've done that for one meeting .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "for forced alignment .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'m just for overlaps is we did it for not for words .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so this would be like if you take the words and force align them on all the individual close talk close talking mikes then how good are these in reality", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then was thinking it", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we might want to take twenty minutes and do closer word level transcription .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "actually mark the word boundaries .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "or have someone look at the alignments", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "linguist who can say roughly if these are and how far away they are .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it 's gotta be pretty good", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because otherwise the word recognition would be really crummy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it wouldn't necessarily be the other way around ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if the wor word recognition was crummy the alignment might be", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if the word recognition is this good the alignment should be pretty good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that 's about it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wonder if this is good thing or bad thing though ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we 're pr", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that we 're starting so ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if we 're producing database that everybody 's gonna do on", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't worry about it", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's the close talking mikes .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "try it on the ms and", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so the real value of the database is these ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there 's still just the the percentages", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , they 're not", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as we 've talked about before there 's probably overlaps", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is not that good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 's probably overlaps in in fair number in switchboard as", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but there 's other phenomena ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's meeting ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's different thing and there 's lots of to learn with the close talking mikes", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "certainly 'd like to see as soon as we could ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "get some of the glitches out of the way", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but soon as we could how it does with say with the ms or even one of the", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and see if it 's ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it hundred twenty percent", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or it 's not", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if with some adaptation you get this down to fifty percent or forty - five percent", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then if for the pzm it 's seventy like that", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's actually something we could work with little bit", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no it 's really ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this way we least have baseline", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we know that the transcripts are very good", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so once you can get to the words that the recognizer which is total subset of the things you need to understand the text", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they 're pretty good", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so and it 's converting automatically from the xml to the chopping up the wave forms and", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's not the case that the end of one utterance is in the next segment and things like that which we had more problems with in switchboard", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that 's good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and let 's see", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there was one more thing wanted to mention", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it was , really didn't do this myself", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's really good .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so andreas set up this recognizer and", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the recognizer all the files 'm moving to sri and running everything there", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so brought back just these result files", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and people can look at them", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we we talked about setting up the sri recognizer here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that 's if there are more machines here", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "plus people can could run their own variants of of the recognition runs", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "certainly if the recognition as opposed to training ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "need . need to ask one question .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "which is so this issue of the legalistic aspects of the pre - sent pre - adapted", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": ", so what is", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "the the data that you take into sri , first question ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "you 're maintaining it in place that wouldn't be publicly readable that ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "from the outside world or", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "by people who are not associated with this project .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's human subjects issues ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "told you about that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we have no names .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that that 's not the issue ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "de audio data itself ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's just the audio data itself ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "until people have chance to edit it .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "- , exactly .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so protect my directories through there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now they 're not they 're in the speech group directories which so will", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "didn't know that actually .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we just have to go through this process of having people approve the transcriptions ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "say it 's .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we had to get them to approve", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and then cuz the other question was gonna ask is if we 're having it 's", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but this meeting that you have , no problem", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "cuz speak for myself", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's us .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but that we didn't do anything that but", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "anyway so wouldn't be too concerned about it with respect to that", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "although we should clear it with eric and dan", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but these results are based on data which haven't had the haven't had the chance to be reviewed by the subjects", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 's true .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and how that stands ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "if you if you get fantastic results and it 's involving data which later end up being lessened by , certain elisions , then", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but wanted to raise that issue ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 's all .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "once we get all this streamlined it may be sh it", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "hopefully it will be fairly quick", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we get the transcriptions , people approve them and so on", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's just that we 're", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we need to work at system for doing that approval so that we can send people the transcripts", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and get back any bleeps that they want", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "actually the bleeps are also an issue .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's gonna be rare thing that there 's bleep for the most part .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "actually had question about the downsampling ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "who , how this was done", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but is there are there any issues with downsampling", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don did this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because know that the recognizer that we use can do it on the fly", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we wouldn't have to have it do it explicitly beforehand .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and is there any", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are there other sev is there more than one way to do the downsampling where one might be better than another ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there are lots of there are lots of ways to do the downsampling different filters to put on ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "like anti - aliasing .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "don't think we even know which one", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "assume you 're using syncat to do it ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "no , 'm using sn snd are resample .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "or sound resample ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "re - re ref", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and dan 's archaic acronyms .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "missing all the vowels .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "some of the vowels ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not all of them .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "almost all the vowels ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's the hard part .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so so the other thing we should try is to just take the original wave forms ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and few of the consonants .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "segment them but not downsample them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could we could try that and compare", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and and feed them to feed them to the sri recognizer and see if the sri front - end does something .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "suspect that 's premature optimization ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we can try it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "only downsampled them first cuz was", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's just one line that 's one line of code to comment at", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and it doesn't is no more work for for us .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they 're just bigger to transfer ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's why downsampled them before but", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but they 're only twice as big", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that was if it 's the same then we can downsample here", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's it 's just", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if it 's", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "although those eighty meg files take while to copy into my directories", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's not it wouldn't be problem if you 're interested in it", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "we could try that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it would be it would probably take about", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "minus the transfer time it would it would take ten minutes to try and and", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it 's about fifty minute drive ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and and if for some reason we see that it works better then we might investigate why", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it takes more disk space too", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , , what", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in the front - end we could do that .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so you just train just different filters", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so you 're just wondering whether the filter is", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "imagine it would be", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so we could try that with this particular twenty minutes of speech and see if there 's any differences .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "at some point someone might have optimized whatever filtering is done for the actual recognition performance .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so in other words", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it just seems to me that , small changes to the language model and the vocabulary will so swamp that it may be premature to worry about that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so one is half percent better than the other", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "don't think that gives you any information .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's just as easy to give you the sixteen individual ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it was just more disk space for storing them", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "are you are you using mel cepstrum or plp over there ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so probably doesn't matter .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could try .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there 's there 's your answer .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but but it wouldn't hurt to try ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's what would assume but you never know ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no the reason say this", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "plp uses auto - regressive filtering and modeling and so it can be sensitive to the filtering that you 're doing", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but mel cepstrum might not you wouldn't expect to be so much", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can try it if you generate like the same set of files just up to that point where we stopped anyway", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and just sti stick them somewhere", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's it 's really not problem .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "actually , no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and 'll rerun it with", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't stop at that part because we 're actually using the entire conversation to estimate the speaker parameters ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so shouldn't use you should , get", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'ll have to do is the reference file would stay the same ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "it 's just the individual segments would be approximately twice as long", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and could just replace them with the bigger ones in the directory ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that 's not problem .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "hand - edited the whole the whole meeting", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that can be run", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "once we get the bug out .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one one question which is had the impression from this meeting that that transcribed that that there was already automatic downsampling occurring ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that in order to", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so it was so it 's like there 's already down", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "there 's one level that 's already happening here .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "this is being recorded at forty - eight kilohertz . which is more that anybody needs", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it gets downsampled to sixteen .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and that 's actually said in your meeting ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's how know that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's exactly , and that 's how .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's like are we downsampling to sixteen ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's digital audio orientation for the board", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's in the monitor so it 's", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "thank it 's not more than that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and have no idea what filter it 's using ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "is eight kilohertz is eighty kilohertz generally accepted as like standard for voice ?", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "that 's what was gonna say ,", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "so it 's it 's just that they were operating from switchboard which was completely telephone database", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so that was standard for that sixteen", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so sixteen seems to be pretty typical for with this thing .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "sixteen is more common for broadband that isn't", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that isn't music .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that isn't music and isn't telephone ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if you 're comparing like if you wanna run recognition on the pzm you would want you don't want to downsample the wh that", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "why is that ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "don if it 's any better", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no actually would think that you would you would get better you 'd get better high frequencies in the local mike .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "all the way around 'd think .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but who knows ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we do we we wanna find all this out ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could try it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we 're gonna have plenty of low frequency on the ms with the fans .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "there was just one more thing wanted to say which is unrelated to the recognition except that", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "chuck fillmore to record meetings but he had too many people in his meetings", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that 's too bad cuz they 're very animated", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and but jerry also so we 're starting on", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they 're less animated .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but he has fewer", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "he won't have more than eight", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it 's meeting on even deeper understanding , edu ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that sounds interesting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as compliment to our front - end meeting", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so that 's gonna start monday", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and one of the things that was realizing is it would be really if anyone has any ideas on some time synchronous way that people in the meeting can make comment to the person whose gonna transcribe it", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or put push button when they wanna make note about \" boy you should probably erase those last few \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or \" want this not to be recorded now \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "weren't we gonna do something with pad at one point ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the cross pads ?", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "we could do it with the cross pads .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "cuz was thinking if the person who sets up the meeting isn't there and it 's group that we", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and this came up talking to jerry also", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that is there any way for them to indicate to make that the qu request that they have that they make explicitly get addressed somehow", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if anyone has ideas", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or you could even write down \" it 's about three twenty five and \"", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what was just suggesting is we have these this cross pad just for this purpose", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and use that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and just use that", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not bad idea .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and if we sink it in", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the other thing is", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if this or if it 's question for the mail to dan", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but is this thing of two eight channel boards maximum for this setup or could we go to third board ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'ll send mail to dan and ask .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that it 's the maximum we can do without lot of effort", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "because it 's one board with two digital channels .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it is one board .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it takes two fibers in to the one board .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and so if we wanna do that more than that we 'd have to have two boards ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then you have the synchronization issue .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but that 's question because that would", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it was possible cuz it is", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "already we have group of people in this room that cannot all be miked", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it 's not just cuz we haven't been to the store ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what is the limit on each of those fiber channels ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it just it 's eight channels come in ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "does it have do with the sampling rate ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's eight .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "have no idea .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but each fiber channel has eight channels", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and there are two ch two fibers that go in to the card .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it might be hard limitation ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one thing is it the whole thing as said is all structured in terms of forty - eight kilohertz sampling", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that pushes requirements up bit", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was just wondering if that could change .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then we 'd also have to get another add and another mixer and all that .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if we could drop that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so 'll send mail to dan and ask him .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "are we done with that ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so the oth topic is getting more mikes and different mikes ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we can fit we have room for one more wireless", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and the wireless ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "this unit here is three fifty three hundred fifty dollars ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it didn't realize but we also have to get tuner the receiver the other end ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's four thirty", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "for for each ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the tuner is four thirty for each .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we just need one more so", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "at least we got the good ones .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that 's something like seven hundred eighty bucks for one more of these .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then also it turns out that the connector that this thing uses is proprietary of sony", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "believe it or not", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and sony only sells this headset .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so if we wanna use different set headset the solution that the guy suggested and they lots of people have done is sony will sell you the jack with just wires coming out the end", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and then you can buy headset that has pigtail and solder it yourself .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and that 's the other solution", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and so the jacks are forty bucks apiece", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and the he recommended crown cm three eleven ae headset for two hundred bucks apiece .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "there isn't this some thing that plugs in ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you actually have to go and do the soldering yourself ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "becau - the reason is the only thing you can get that will plug into this is this mike or just the connector .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "the reason ask is these handmade wiring jobs fall apart in use", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the other thing is to see if we can get them to do custom job and put it together for this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'m they would , they would just charge us ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and they 'd probably want quantity too ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no they 'll just charge us more ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it 's this", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so so my question is should we go ahead and get na nine identical head - mounted crown mikes ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "not before having one come here and have some people try it out .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because there 's no point in doing that if it 's not gonna be any better .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so why don't we get one of these with the crown with different headset ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and and see if that works .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and see if it 's preferable and if it is then we 'll get more .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "cuz the microphones are", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's just the", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's just they 're not comfortable to wear .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "could make our own handbands and", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and he said they don't have any of these in stock but they have them in la", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and so it will take about week to get here .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so to just go order ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we 're in this for the long term ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just order it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's lot of money for handband .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and who is the contact if wanna do an invoice", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "cuz that 's how we did it before .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "we 'll do this off - line , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's long time to get from la .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and then nine channels is the maximum we can do ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so one is for the daisy chain so that 's fifteen instead of sixteen", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "without getting more .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and there 's six on the table", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that 's nine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can ask really dumb question ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is is there any way we can have like wireless microphone that you pass around to the people who the extra people for the times they wanna talk that", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's good idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 's not dumb question ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's good idea ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like like jerry springer thing ,", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'m just not how we would handle that in the", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's like the conch .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "but there might be way to say that there are gonna be these different people", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "see , look .", "speaker": "F"}, {"text": "and identifying somehow ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so nail the chairs down .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was just thinking of jerry springer .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's not bad idea .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "if we can't get another board and even if we can have feeling they 'll be some work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the springer mike .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for the few times that you might wanna have that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let 's figure that we have eight which are set up", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then there 's ninth which is passed around to", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "hand - held ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's good idea", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or also for if people are not", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we could just hand around the lapel .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "no not the lapel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you want handset ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "is the is the hand - held really any better ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "liz hates the lapel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but know the lapel is really suboptimal .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no it depends on the hand - held", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but hand many hand - helds are built wi with anti - shock things so that it is less susceptible to hand noises .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you hold the lapel mike you just get all sorts of junk .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the ones they really pass around must be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so wonder if they have one that will hook up .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "wonder if they have one that will hook up to this or whether again we 'll have to wire it ourselves .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you wouldn't want it to hook there", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you 'd just want it to hook into the receiver in the other room ,", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you need transmitter .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is isn't that built into the mike ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "get get different radio ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just these ones that they pass around with no wireless", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you need ra but it has to correspond to the receiver .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have little antenna coming out the bottom .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it 's gonna be much easier to get one of these and just plug in mike ,", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but then the mike has to", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you have to hand it around", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if you have two pieces of", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is good point ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you have these mikes with little antenna on the end", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and do you think you would be able to use the same receiver ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "you 'll have to check with them ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'ll 'll ask .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "but that 's that 's idea", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it 's just frequency .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then just have that as the and then you can have groups of twenty people or whatever", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because there 's only as andreas pointed out actually in the large the larger the group the less interaction the less people are talking over each other", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it just there might be lot of people that speak once or twice", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "off you go ,", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so people who have to leave can leave", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and do we have anything else to discuss or should we just do digits ?", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "of some extra couple of extra things 'd like to mention .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "one of them is to give you status in terms of the transcriptions so far .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so as of last night 'd assigned twelve hours and they 'd finished nine", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and my goal was to have eleven done by the end of the month ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that by tomorrow we 'll have ten .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so they 're still working .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 's good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and this got this email from jane at like two in the morning", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's good .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so it 's really", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it 's working out , .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's really .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then also an idea for another meeting , which would be to have the transcribers talk about the data", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's little bit little bit", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 's idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 'd be very interesting .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's idea cuz 'd like to have it recorded so that we can remember all the little things ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'d love to hear what they have to say .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "that 's idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if we got them to talk about this meeting , it would be meta meeting .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "nested several layers ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "now you have eight transcribers and there 's ten of us", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so how do we do this , is the only thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or just have them talk amongst themselves .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have them have their own meeting .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that 's what 'm thinking ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "have them talk about the data and they and they 've made observations to me", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that would be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like they say this meeting that we think has so much overlap , it does", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but there are other groups of similar size that have very little ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "it 's part of it 's it 's the norm of the group and all that", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and they have various observations that would be fun , .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 's idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'d like to hear what they say .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "so we could they could have meeting more or less without us that to do this and we should record it", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then one or two of them could come to one of these meetings and could could tell us about it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "give us status .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "it 's they will get to transcribe their own meeting but they also get paid for having break", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that would be weird .", "speaker": "E"}, {"text": "and that 's good idea ,", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "get them involved .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that 's idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'m really have to", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no have to go as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then wanted to also say something about the fiscus john fiscus visit tomorrow .", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and which is to say that it 'll be from nine to one", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "that 'm going to offer the organization allow him to adjust it if he wishes", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "but to be in three parts ,", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "the acoustic part coming first which would be the room engineering aspects", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "and he 'll be also presenting what nist is doing", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "number two would be the transcription process", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "so this would be focus on like presegmentation and the modifications to the multitrans interface", "speaker": "G"}, {"text": "which allows more refined encoding of the beginnings and ends of the overlapping segments", "speaker":
