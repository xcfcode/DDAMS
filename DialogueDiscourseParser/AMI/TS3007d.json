{"text": "take it away .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this was our first concept .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we decided to use single touch-screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , we've worked out this concepts , how to hold it , where to put the buttons and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , we began with form of shape , that is easy to hold in one hand , left or handed .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , we made it little bit less thick and it has some ar artistic meaning .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this isn't nothing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "idea is better .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "during the meeting showed you the concept of placing the buttons on top , usable with your thumb , and the menu structure , if necessary , with your other hand , so it's just gonna hold it easily .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it has to be acce accessible with your other hand too , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we began working out concept .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "these would be the main buttons , you could change them later on in your own profile if you want to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , t's standard they will be delivered with this set-up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have the more advanced menu setting here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have the sub-menus and stu .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we made top , or front view .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just so like you wanna back view .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as you

effect .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what we figured is we'll show you picture later on you have more better idea after that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , idea is for to stay in balance with these two with these two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so when you put it on the table , it will just lay down .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it won't roll around or .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text":

straight panel , but more fluidly and round .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the panel just goes like this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the overlaying layer is little bit curved and .", "speaker":

about the colour , what have , as colours , do you have the picture in .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we added that this can be held with your hands for this maximum is om , one and half centimetres

.", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's called weemote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's actually brilliant marketing stand .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but so this actually basic the idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what got in mind .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we just want to build more adult vers adult version of this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and for colours , we figured starting with basic colours like white or metallic grey .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "those are the technological colours actually , so it or blue or whatever .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it would be best to appeal to broad public and make the covers exchangeable , so the young people will buy an orange and red and blue and purple , but when the older people go in the shop and they see an

some noi hip , cover is necessary , 'cause als otherwise you'll just have the screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's an idea to sell it without cover , so that you can pick cover in the shop .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , there must be some cheap standard cover , white , that's could comes with it and you can buy , so we can make extra money .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you mustn't

have the money to do it and they want to buy that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , it's an idea to put that as an extra and not as standard .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", perhaps you're .",

be some attractive flashy colours .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or blue or .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not too , but little , because that's our aim .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "li like this .",

"speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause when you use pen , you can just draw like you draw normally , and you do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "may the idea you proposed is screen here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and draw it , and it's placed over there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that would be easier .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or at least when you don't have to adapt to the technology , just you can write in the way you normally write .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and now you have to keep constantly in mind that you're drawing on this screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that's very bad concept .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "nah , it's my opinion that , it's can be saved easier .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but this is better than regular flip-overs , but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but if you're in normal flip-over you lot of people write text .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's no text option .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and writing text , you've gotta really do your best to write some .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and some functions for circle or square .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have to draw it yourself now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or even

just make link in .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's one way to if you're not using the eraser something else , arrow .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here , that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you have as you saw , you have little , you can , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can go there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so there the functionality is there , but it's not ideal , and it's very it costs lot of time to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to use , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that's pity , if you have thirty , forty minutes for this things , and we are now with four people , but it , imagine you are here you're with the ten people and everyone .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's mostly the case , from the over here

drawing , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the one or two things you have to draw when you're there , just use flip-board .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what really miss also is turtle is decision

{"text": "just like he said with the screen which you can write , also voting mechanism .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ju , voting application .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just little group decision application .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , problem is , you can't discuss anything you ca you can , but you will discuss lot less than like we did now .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we one person said three .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , we said , no think two , because this and this , and then you can react on it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if you put three on it , just figure , everybody knows what i'm knowing , so they'll all just put two on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , you can still discuss about it , but click it in an application , that's lot easier to process .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it would .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the for processing part .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then , the idea of one person entering it and the rest
