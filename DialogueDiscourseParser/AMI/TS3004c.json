idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how are you gonna make it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it bit like the remote control ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because fancy look is the most important

that's definitely more expensive than , but telephone , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but how we we're gonna make many of those .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we can start mass production , and then the cost will still will be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but telephone also have and it's about two hundred euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we gotta de we have to decide on that .",

email and it says the chip can be simple , regular or advanced .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they say display requires an advanced chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and this is more expensive

"C"}, {"text": "i'll give you my design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we're doing if we're doing display .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we can had to make design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so did some searching on the internet .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "watched the old remote controls and news com remote como remote controls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we should this is one of the modern remote controls of the moment .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we should go more to the ipod and m_p_ three players .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you probably have to make it bit bigger and bit smaller .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out both sides .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and here you just have one , few buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's the main difference .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but looks definitely think we should go like this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then changeable fonts , so it's the most important part , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but and the home base is something like that , something simple .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then ordered the buttons bit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "on-off , mute .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and two others , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the teletext tel no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "text button , there and there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then the colour buttons , if we want it on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't find it very usable , but it's don't t's fits in the modern theme as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , don't like it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so and then we saw the pla display , in the ipod .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and above ten .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it that's on the display .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that there is no display there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it's on the place of the display .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we should light this up much more than that part .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the focus is on these two parts .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you don't see all the buttons you else need .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it sounds very difficult to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because the volume and channel is on the bottom of it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is how it is now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can't use your thumb for it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here have volume .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it is on the bottom too .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it's not the best .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here we have also side scrolls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we can use that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do we want to use for volume ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i've got something of that too .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for volume , or channel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we can even simplify it more .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "by just putting the volume on the side .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and just channel buttons here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the channels as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or the channel buttons are often used .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "t's it's here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we cho should put that on top , and buttons we don't use on , in the bottom .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they're on top ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just other buttons like text t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "put that on the button bottom .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because you can't hold it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you mean these to the low ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can't hold it the control and push the buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "except from the on-off button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you'll use the switch channels buttons more often than the normal channel buttons , like one two three .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we can put that on the bottom .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we'll , it's not easy if it's below .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like zapping is just switching one channel at time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's harder to zap .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it should be easy to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's good , but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if you don't light up , they don't you don't see very good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the focus gets on these parts and not on there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the position can be different .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's we have to look what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we can switch these to if it will look good , if you put those on the bottom half .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , the top buttons are .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they sh those should be on top .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "those two , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we can switch those two , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , you have to make it's easy to yes , it has to be big enough so you can hold it , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's my findings .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "m_p_ three player .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if we want to put in speech rec recognition , we don't think we should put it on top then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to switch it open .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to use so if you put in speech recognition , you need so more many more buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which won't look good on the front side .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's something we have to decide on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have to keep it simple .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have to decide this lecture , or this fifty minutes , how it is gonna look .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what we're gonna do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the component design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "looked at some similar devices , and my own common knowledge .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this was on the web site .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you aim at young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so flashy kinda colours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "shapes should be curved , so round shapes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not nothing square-like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ipod is trendy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it is curved square .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but is has round corners .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we shouldn't have too square corners and that thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not the old box look .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and sports and gaming device style characteristics .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "exactly what that means , but it should be , popular looking , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have to put our real reaction logo as on the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's black yellow control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the colours also .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we have ha to ma make it in black , yellow .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the sides in yellow and the top in black .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not that weird , because we definitely want to make it flashy , to attract young public .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but don't think the colours black and yellow go together .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we make you can put yellow on the side and black on the front .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's sen that's just matter of tastes , but we have to use flashy colours , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can't we use different fron fronts , with all with the logo on it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can we do that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like fronts in red and yellow and blue and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and still trans still transparent .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but with all with logo on it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is remote control , very old one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then the components .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the case has just here's black .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we are making it , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we make it som we have to make it from soft material .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but anyways it should be transparent .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we decided that , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one of the options .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can just like mobile phone , you can make different fronts on it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can just replace them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could do that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that was the idea , or just release one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just give five with them , just in box .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or just sell different ones .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you could make like blue and transparent .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you can still look through it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like normal ordinary buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "more , just rubber really has an odd look .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it

"B"}, {"text": "so just hard plastic ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's mentioned here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "titanium , it's too expensive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the form has to be bit different .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not the sh the square form .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just bit more rounded .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can make it curved or round .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but just in two d_ , not in depth .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we have to decide which one we're going to choose from these .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because we have to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the energy is the recharger .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we already know that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just normal battery .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have batteries .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the chip-on-print is normal one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the case is just plastic one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the chip is the regular one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "re , regular .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have the simple one , regular and advanced .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's should be regular the second .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll just check it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we need plastic case , with scroll wheel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "user interface concept .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and flashy light .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'm not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we do if we expected to draw on this one at this moment .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or should we do it in the next meeting ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i_d_ and u_i_d_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we should did it here ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's for the next one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're staying here ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's for that that's the next meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or should we do it in the next meeting ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you definitely get specific instruction .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so now we're ka thirty minutes alone again ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but think about something that's more rounded .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just and more it has to be bit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the ipod and etcetera , m_p_ three players , mobile phones .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just on the top or on the bottom .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just bit cur , i'll see if see any of those .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the wheel can be like this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you draw it like this , you get what the fuck is it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you see what ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if draw here it draws about four centimetres lower than nah .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can make it like this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and this is all the wheel for volume .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that you just it's all rounded , so you can do turn this one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like very big scroll-wheel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but just not on the top , but on the side of it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we have this at the moment .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you'll get lot of volume changing when it's not wanted .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we'd have this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's little problem , as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's probably better .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and like this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we can make plastic , so that you if you like drop it , it won't change the volume .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you just have to make it that's not scrollable too easy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "only if you use your finger .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and what's the channel choose ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "where do we put that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "still on the bottom or that's the numbers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wh what is the middle part ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the numbers should be in the bottom , and the switch channel in the middle .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "use the dz , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it doesn't make difference , if you put the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because you already have the volume here , so you can also put it here one butt and the other one there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "next to each other .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "back and forth .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because you have to hold it as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or you could do the switch channel up button above the numbers and switch channel down button below .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that's not want to zap very quick , so ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "zapping is the highest priority .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then you use those , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is this opportunity , or you don't want different why ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we should bu put on top of each other , so because then it's easy to know if push the up , but the top button is like you switch channel up , and down button is if you put them but left to is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with channel changing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but still the next it's still the next one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "doesn't make , but fo from left to is exactly the same .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it ma it doesn't make big difference .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's obvious , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's not it's not al always the same .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's exactly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in on most remote controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "every remote control's different .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if we use that , they will probably have long learning time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you already have the volume on the side , so you can't make it you can't ma make mistake .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's so but that's for you , 'cause it's , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's so simple you just , i'll take look at it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what did what else we have to discuss about ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "think we need to work thirty minutes again ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have to care that it looks really new .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because we still hold on to the ordinary square remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause wha what see the only difference is that we use scroll-wheel on the outside .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the led .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , you have it is the current controllers are all black and plastic .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it should be round in shape .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so no , tha that will be , so top down .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have to look at that image of the ipod .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "more that style .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and bit some bling can we have and how many fronts do we put on the market then ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not the old grey black where you can put ve we have if we do it like that we have below have we lot of room to put logo .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the logo was has to be on there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or more or and buy the product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's give five .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can buy separate ones and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you buy , you get one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or you can choose one if you buy the project .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's your choice , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that good opportunity ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you could put it like that , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you sl you let it slide in the docking station .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do we have to design that as ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the docking station ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can it could be just square , just packet .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , that can be very simple .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just where you're around something .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "li , we had one example .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we have to make contacts on the remote control and the recharger as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that's round one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which here you see one that's very round .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can choose then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that can be all shapes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you can just round up the corners bit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "of the remote control ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just round it up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you don't want this like the ipod .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but more rounded .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it will just look like more like this one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "since it's this is also rounded .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , just the corners .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "tho those are al already bit cornered .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but then we have to think of something new .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we can do all kinds of as long as it isn is in two d_ we can use all round shapes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not in depth .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , if we want to make it , new .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've had lot of picture of old ones .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and all curves have already been done .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's bit annoying , isn't it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what do we do wrong ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just more like this and not square .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we could do lot of , lot more curving .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would do it like in this shape or .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "know we can do lot more , but it will only look more like the old remote controls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it it's very annoying .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it's handy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the olden ones had looked like just square thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but had lot of pictures show you here what the old ones look like .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "curves , curves .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you've more there as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it wasn't very small one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that is for elderly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we have to make decision , what form it's gonna have going to have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if my opinion .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we just take the ipod , and the same look .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so light or just whatever colour , but the same light colours .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and just with together with the back-lights look will look very new .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no rubber buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just together with the back-lights you'll get new look .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "more like the m_p_ three player m_ p_ three player .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you have the scroll button inside .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just simple scrollb doesn't have to be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but why do we have to round it on the bottom then ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "of skip that one as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "though that's trend .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we want to make it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , i'm not trendwatcher , you are .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so spongeball kinda .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the trend is spongy and fruity .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's not lot of trends found it the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we have still one minute left .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so just it's if you just keep it bit square .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "something about ergonomic fits-in-the-hand .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it's still for older people .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you still have older people .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's only annoying if it if it's like that formed like that , like whatever .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just you have normal but it is already fancy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there is one there's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original , and hope we can make it look not like the ipod itself .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we're aiming at young public .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it must have very different , they're all the same .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you're if you look at the way remote controls are now and if you make it look like the ipod .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because of the lights on the bottom of it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's already fancy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's already very big change compared to ye .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "make the wha what's it called scroll wheel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "make it in yellow .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just like the colours of real reaction .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could do that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if you the front , the scroll wheel will still be yellow .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "think the scroll wheel won't be very big .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "since if you put it somewhere , the chances that it will scroll are too big .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it will just be small scroll wheel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it won't stick out much .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the ones we are going to draw there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to ask to the to her if it has if it can work better than this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because it doesn't work properly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you have to ask her .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can just open images there , and i'll paint and paint .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll be able to do better job .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's probably , so just finish it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you set the pen , he will draw here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we make it bit like that one probably .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll see it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "bu , agree more like ipod .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "only the colour and the flashy light and the we just skip the voca or was it the speech recognition .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do we keep that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then it that's very easy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or keep that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you'd definitely need advanced chip .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we have to build in microphone and , and do anything about that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we already have the beeping of the home station , so strange that received the information about that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "didn't receive any information on speech recognition , so fine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the ma the main points just said .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so can we just put it speech recognition in it as , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to be original and technological innovative .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but ma but we don't have any information about the cost .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so shall we it open then ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we can put all the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the function of that in there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we need probably we need advanced chip then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we probably do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it doesn't say anything about it , does it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we started with information about the cost was now and how much is the chip ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have some information about the cost .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but just about the chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the and how does it work ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how much , but just in inexpensive or but it's separate chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "our division has developed new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker unit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is very small electronic unit , will give standard answer after it recognise question .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it no .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just you say record , followed by your question sample , and after few seconds the answer sample .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because so it works like good morning remote control , and then the remote control says good morning .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it doesn't has to say anything .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just you have to just talk to , we have to stop it now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does it say does it say something back ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's just it's no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so just , that's advanced , we just decide not to put it in , because it's too difficult .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it that's integrated in the chip , so if you use the speech recognition , that's in it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "anything about this , but nah .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it would be good feature .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we just put it in , because it's good feature .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no worries about the cost , etcetera .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have to stop now .", "speaker":
