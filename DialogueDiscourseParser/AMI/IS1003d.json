judgement it's is biased .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so whe where is the remote control ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , we are so let's go for our detailed design meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have first the project presentation by our user interface designer , david jordan , and our industrial designer , baba .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we'll have to evaluate the your proposed remote control , and have an idea of the price that this thing will cost .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the production .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so will let the our two designers talk about so their you have , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that is three .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "effectively one slide and we can discuss everything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , this is our product or prototype .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is made by clay .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the basic colour is yellow and red .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yellow is our company colour , red it's is more attractive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we used two basic colour , yellow and red .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the shape , there's two basic shape .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the first is circle and the second is triangle piece .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's we call it mushroom design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is introduction of our product .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "next mo , so next slide .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "genetically modified mushroom will say , but keep on speaking .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so there are several key features of our pr prototype .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the first is that it is fuzzy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm this would be the unique design the market .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's fuzzy design , and unique design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the second key feature is that circle channel selection .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in the traditional key traditional controller use button to select the channel but now we have circle , so we can turn this ball to select channel .", "speaker": "C"},

triangle base .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this sta this triangle base is very stable , so it's unlikely you cannot found it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's , you can put it in the table so you can turn the ball to cha to select the channel and there's some cute button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can see the shape of the buttons is mushroom , so , everything's mushroom .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we can call our remote control the mushroom .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "mush mushroom design , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it's not like really mushroom because

"don't hope nobody will eat it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to integrate the fruit aspect , the in really ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because mushroom was not in the trends .", "speaker": "D"},

very enlighted colours , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "inspira inspiration is true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and inspired colour and very sophisticated material , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so what we what add is that , he talk about what is outside , so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about , the chip , it is low level chip , and , we don't need to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no this our only two slides .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we cut it to see .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wi the low level chips inside and the button and the battery it is under .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so where's the battery ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it is in the base , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in the base .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in the basement .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in the basement .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and where is the solar cell ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we say we sa we said solar .", "speaker": "D"},

you won't be it won't cris increase the price ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll see after .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we will have first to so , mister money , what's your opinion according to this remote control ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it might be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we gonna try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about we had three keys key points to for this remote control design , and first one was fancy look and feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we'll try to judge this feature with one to seven scale , one being no , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just let me check .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , four point three point five , it means it's acceptable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one being true , and seven being false .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so do we have fancy look and feel , according to you ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you have colours .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't the sha the bowl shape people like .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but is it i'll agree it's unique , but is it really , fancy was defined by fruit and vegetable look .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the shape is unique , and the colour so it depend on how do you define fancy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is it really fancy ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it's you have the lemon aspect of this thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you change if you take the buttons out , and do things like that it would be bet more like lemon ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do don't do that , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "where the lemon is , but it's not obvious .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's this shape is lemon like , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if , improving the texture of like having it less smooth or .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because less button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , my mush .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "looks like more fruit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you don't have any button now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , you have the finger here , with the buttons ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's , is that that's good idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it looks more like pineapple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what's the use for that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for turn the ball .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have no idea , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you want to turn the ball , it's very convenient for you to turn the ball to change the channel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have no idea what if it is fancy or not .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and where is the voice recognition ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's embedded , your microphone .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the second point .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this there's two functions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is microphone array .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "first one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is it better like that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , the colour is , that's fine .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we can say the colour , is the colour acceptable ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "looks , let's say it's pineapple now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the shape now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's but would say there is more too much red .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it looks like now you took it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's too much red ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in the basement ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it looks like pineapple with cherry on top .", "speaker": "A"},

"no , seven is false and one is true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "three , it's .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "three , will say three .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "three , three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "three is fine for me .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "isn't it bitter like that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then let me the other criterion is it technologically in innovative .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what other is it easy to use ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you said previously that you there's microphone inside an .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is microphone array , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's micro array , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there four microphone .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you have the there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so they there's microphone array .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you can capture voice , you , so you can capture voice from different directions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you can turn it so it's techno technologically innov innovative ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you you've never seen rou round remote control , so it is , but see , you have microphone array embedded .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "bu but when you say technologically it's more , in the core , or single .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have tactile buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have that's good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , that's good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and you have , this ki this solar receptor that , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's another really good point .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "technically it's acceptable , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so using the same scale , two ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "two , two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would say two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's fine , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's better like that , isn't it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now the most critical one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "most , for the vocal command yes , it's might be easy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "last one would like to judge is it easy to use ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's just speaking .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's very easy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you just need the command .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but this turning can you just re explain me the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can use this in this way .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is the base .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you can turn to change the channel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you just tu turn .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you he if you hear some click , it would , that's difficult .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like if you want to go from but imagine you i'm no i'm not definitely convinced it's the best way to if you wanna jump from , one to twenty ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you take the remote , so and you can turn like that to change the channel ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's quite easy to so zapping , but it will be too fast .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how can you go directly to twenty , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's dif that's difficult .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it depend on the angle you turn the if this is channel one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but how you need to something that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if you're fro from two ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it could be channel two , channel three , channel four , channel five .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have , like that , and so on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you can if you have scale , so , it's bit difficult .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ju just imagine you have fifty channels we're not talking .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fifth channel divided by the num by the by three hundred thirteen degree .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you got how many degree you it no , you don't have to no it's when you stop when you stop , the turn , then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you it's very easy , because you kn how many channel are there in the , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how do this angle is the correct one ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you count one degree , two degrees , no .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can do it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you can do it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , you can just change .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the vocal command is easy too .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can say fifty and fifty it's , so , and that's .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "voc vocal command is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we've said previously that it's not going to be the main and this would be more for browsing , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there's also number , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other , so you're passing through all the channels .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , when you say want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty , so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if you really want to do zapping you don't really you want to do , you can turn it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just go through all the channels and stop if there is something interesting ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "seems to be good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "good choice , mister david jordan .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and but i'd it is turn off button , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and also you can , if you ca you can turn this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what's this cherry ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or you ca you can also turn this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for this you can tune it's for tune .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two , you skip this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you want to from skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's like fine , from coarse to fine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is coarse , this is fine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's very technologic , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's coarse to fine design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the this looks better .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is this is , from one channel to ten channel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but di didn't see where the turn off turn on turn off button so much activates one of the it's on off , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is from one channel to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have the vocal commands .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it has to be on to recognise fas , that's not the ecological part , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "most of the time you have the it's sleeping remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that why we have the solar ti .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , which number ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "easy to use , it's very relative but three it's fine , it's reasonable three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you agree ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "agree , agree .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so reasonably , is four , is one ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "three for me , it's .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , three .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "four or three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and what's your opinion ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we wouldn't say , those are but this one would be more five to me .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "will you give four ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'd like this is the just prototype .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm not really convinced it's so easy to use , but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if but you just push two button , zero and one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what do what you compare with traditional tr traditional controller ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's easier than traditional controller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you use traditional controller you have to put button , but now you don't have to put button , you have you just turn the ball .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's two balls , the smaller the so you can control the scale .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you have .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but in the traditional controller , how do how can you control the scale ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "by pushing zero after the first one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", you can do it , but you can also do it in the if you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just there's also button here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that's are there some buttons ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this function is just for your browsing , from one channel to the next one , the next sn , the third one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's not what you said previously .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "previously you said that turning this was the fine to coarse .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you're changing your mind .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fine to coarse .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and from ten to ten channels here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one to ten , ten to twelve , ten to twenty .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ten to twenty and this one , one two three four five six , like this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's different scale , so you can choose how much do you want to sc .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but this has to stay on the table , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this has to stay on the table .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is just base .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on flat place you can ye yes , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can just .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then when you turn it just it's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can't put it out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's just your turning from the base .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you need to have everything in hand .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you want to turn , you can't use it and turn .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you need to put it on and turn .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "tha that's the weak point , because with traditional one you just have one hand .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you use your so this is next generation controller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say i've lost the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "nobody would take it .",

cou four .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can change from four ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "four , it's .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll put four .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "easy to use , four .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "gonna say four .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "four it's more reasonable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's even easier to .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can erase with this er .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "four it's more reasonable , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's nine , nine over three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , average ?",
