already been through that part .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it consists of three levels of design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we begin with the functional design , then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "every level of design consists of some individual work , and we close it with meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you all received an email with example of our explanation of what the particular level of design means to the different functions , and you probably read that already , so don't have to tell you about that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first we're gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here , so you get acquainted with these meeting tools .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have the smart-boards , the thes those two boards .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is the presentation boards , wh which one i'm using now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can there's document folder called the sh

software is on the laptop .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is if it's mainly thing for in the meeting , so don't t's if it's important .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this an explanation of the smart-boards .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there is tool-bar over here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's quite simple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have the pen function , eraser function .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's like very simple paint application .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we , we use the same file during the whole day , and you can make new sheets by pu puttin pressing on the blank button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it works like this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if pen is selected , yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with that pen ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's not but it is pen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not working like pen yet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's doing some now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "little bit slower .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can use pen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can use an eraser .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you can make new fi new blanks , and you can change the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward , which you have to select pen format .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then select current colour or line width .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , it's quite easy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now you're all acquainted with the different tools .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're gonna try out the electronic white-boards .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics , on blank sheets with different colours , with different pen widths .", "speaker": "A"},

"A"}, {"text": "i'm gonna use some different colour now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "some little white .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "looks like fish .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is black ?",

"speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so in the format menu you can choose the different colours and pen widths .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what my favourite animal is , but the easiest animal is bird .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "will that's my bird .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "of that actually .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "isn't it quite it's little bit light .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's another one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "tell us something about your favourite characteristics of these particular birds .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ano it's , it's the most simple animal know , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because there's some free in the sky like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , it's clear .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so more birds ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we get your point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "who wants to be next ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll go next .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "haven't got favourite animal too , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what should draw ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll draw penguin .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll draw penguin .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'t draw , so you can start to laugh already .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll do so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "something like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's little bit hard .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's better than

.", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm going to draw cat .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "why , but cat is very smart animal .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you can have them at home .", "speaker": "C"},

"B"}, {"text": "it's not very good drawn , but you can see cat from it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's handicapped cat .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't think darwin would agree with that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's , it's not scared .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "he's crying but it's most cats are small .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "he's crying because it's ugl because of his ugliness .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what do you like about it then ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can handle them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then we are through the tool training , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wouldn't call it training , but alright .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is something about the project finance .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and our profit aim is fifteen million euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're very ambitious on this one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the market range is international , so it's gonna be sold world-wide , and the production cost should be maximum of twelve euro fifty per remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's clear .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're now gonna discuss some when , we're gonna brainstorm about what kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "tell me about your experiences with the remote controls .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you have good experiences with remote controls ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or do they annoy you sometimes ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are they difficult to understand , or they don't interact with different equipment very ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls , but if you see elderly people , all these buttons , and then they buy new t_v_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then different remote control with different functions on different places , and half of the functions are removed , or whatever .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what we need is clear remote control with grouped buttons , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "all the buttons which apply to the text functions in one , one area or whatever , not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button to , to minimise it to this or whatever other functions somewhere else .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "different functions of .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we should group them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and same for the volume buttons and the was thinking since t_v_ is mostly used together with v_c_r_ or d_v_d_ player or recorder , and not with stereo , it should be good to include functions for v_c_r_s and d_v_d_ players , recorders .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , is it gonna be remote control that's what it can be used for different equipment , like your t_v_ and your home stereo ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , the d_v_d_ players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hi-fi sets probably .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's what , from my experience .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but isn't it it's only for television , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "hi-fi set is not often used as know of in combination with television .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we gonna , it is only for televis so wha what document but , where did it where did you find that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not it was only for television .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we probably don't have to have the functions for d_v_d_ player or v_c_r_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , it is only for television , but ll we we're gonna brainstorm about that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we t's useful , we do it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in the email .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it said , television remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's television remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but was thinking since it is useful with d_v_d_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , that's something extras .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but most television remote controls support other functions as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can no , we have to think about that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we've gonna put some is it so user-friendliness , is pri priority in this case , or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also no one's gonna buy it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "only the experts .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this the is some aspect of the , or some point at which we can excel by making it very useful .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that , then you're the usability man , so this gonna be very important task for you then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how can we make it trendy ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do by just sh shape and the look of it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to go with to go with fashion and team leader .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can opener underneath it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for the bear .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or someth something special , like m_p_ three player inside of it , or , then the production costs are gonna be too high probably .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no it , yo we have to keep it simple , to get whole market .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "way too high .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's international , so we have to use standard .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "with different type of fronts or , has to be something spectacular or one which makes it we gonna skip back to the goals probably .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's an idea , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "original , trendly , and user-friendly , we al also already talked about user-friendliness .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , something trendy and original , that goes hand in hand .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when something is original , it tends to be trendy , probably , or we should make it combination of that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you the technical part of the process is something you're gonna look after for , so you have to think about what equipment you want to , you want to manage with it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's an important part for you then , with gogors regards to the user-friendly part of it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you should look out for what makes it trendy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", like some special feature .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or some does it gets some gadgetness .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , what the market wishes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "next meeting starts in thirty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "individual , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the industrial designer will or the working design , we will already said that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the user interface designer is it user inter user interface the technical functions design .",
