[{"edus": [{"text": "hi everyone , hope you had lunch .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright we're moving on to conceptual design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll just review what we did in our last meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "under marketing we targeted our audience , and , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that was generally how helpful that was .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we considered some design options with how it should look , we discussed an ipod-like button system which , we haven't concluded but we're , so , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you've come from our last time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does everyone have presentations ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would anybody like to go first ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i've been looking at the components design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we'll need to custom desi design circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but once we come up with design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , the ipod-style wheel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the infrared l_e_d_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we need radio sender and receiver , those are standard .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and al we also need beeper or buzzer or other noise thing for locating the remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we have some material options .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have rubber case .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and why not wood ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and why not wood ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can use wood .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "why we'd want to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and also we should note that if we want an ipod-style wheel button , it's gonna require qu slightly more expensive chip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't t's much more expensive , but it is more expensive .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's what i've got on design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can do next ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause have to say something about the material which is quite shocking .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", have been searching the current trends , both on the web and via fashion-watchers , and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is fashion , fancy look and feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and last thing is the easy to use factor .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but suppose that is included in the ease of use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "our fashion-watchers in milan and paris have decided , noticed , that the fruit and vegetable theme is the current trend and therefore we need to go for that if we want , wh whatever our motto is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for fashion , we go for fashion .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the fashion in electronics .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and also go for spongy feel , so the question of our technology whate is industrial designer .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as to the material should be limited to how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , how spongy can be achieved but that's the way to go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and prefer fruits to vegetables , but that's just personal opinion .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "people like to have fruit instead of vegetables in their sitting room .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed , so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit , or should the actual remote look like fruit ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and finally again with the spongy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it has to be technologically innovative so again our industrial designer should look into that or find come up with solution that's better than mine .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", to summarise these are the points that need to be , touched in order to get good decision , and hopefully our user interface has more to say about the matter .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for your attention .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's the next it's the blue one , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", there we go .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that fruit and vegetables thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "actually wasn't aware of the new trends in electronics and so , let me get this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "t's trend in fashion , in clothing and fabrics .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you're not gonna wear your remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", alright anyway .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "here we go .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "conceptual user interface .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "trying we're gonna try to talk about , what how people are actually going to be using this ipod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , so , this is touched ba touch-based graphical interface system .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so people are going to be looking at this little screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "assume , are we still on the screen idea ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we hadn't discussed it last time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the wheel you it seems like you would need screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you need screen for it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you need screen with music because you're looking for specific song , like that band or whatever .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but like if you think about it but if so is it just .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "with t_v_ channels it's , one two three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , you you're gonna have to switch to like d_v_d_ and like other things like that , aren't you ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we're , we're actually not having d_v_d_ , that was one of was , to update you on that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the screen can come up on the telly , the she said .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so anyway if just we need to so if we're not gonna have screen was thinking .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's just gonna be wheel then ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you're just gonna you're gonna have to have some .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like mode where you can we're not choosing that , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on the you can have it on the telly though .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but like choose channel control , like if you wa because people aren't gonna be able to have like , channels one two three four five six seven eight nine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that people seems to be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you've , you're saying , you have to but imagine someone with but what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you're gonna have to scroll to get channels .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's wh why was thinking you may need to have some screen because so that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if or then again if you just see like some thing where like you have like the number come up on the t_v_ like what channel you're on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "my flatmates actually had one with wheel , and it did show up on the t_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause you'll have to like but you can quickly you can .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they have to wheel really fast .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the wheel goes through like hundred channels , at least on theirs .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you do , it so it would have to be you so you just kinda need to figure out like what , range we need to have on the wheel , and so you're either you're , you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once you stop that , you can like tap for , different , whatchamacallits , different , functions like volume or , like you can tap just to get to different channels .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like if you just wanted to go to like from five to six you could tap or someth and then there's also the concern about how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television , or if you want to switch around , like , these different modes like turn on the timer or like something like that , like would too , like so and it seems it does seem little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it , because but then again it would it does make if the screen's just like an option that , like , is just there and you're not really using it , that's .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "with that many options , you'd i'd think that the screen would be better , because you could have that menu option , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's more expensive according to the design people .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the only thing though .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have to get an advanced chip if you wanna have screen in , which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so then it has to have some way to get to mode on the television where you're doing , you can get to , you can like it'll be that central button that , like , then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the t_v_ and you can just scroll around , like , to do the timer , to do the , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the t_v_ is the screen , that so it would have all these different options of changing to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the remote itself isn't really cluttered up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "look it even has settings .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "on the you can just take theirs and just but should be comfortable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't want the screen , but 'cause that just it does seem like , it that would be , like , incredibly expensive , but , and then so , it just im really all you need is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what if , if you're thinking of the design of it now , like the , physical attributes , and you just have this , it's like just long silver thing , or whatever we're thinking .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it doesn't seem that you would need anything besides pow and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the t_v_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like , we're looking at something that could be , like even like cir i'm seeing almost like circular like handheld like thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it needs to be easy to somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate and use your how do i'm not really like when use an ipod , end up just using my index finger to like control it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've seen some people just going like that with their thumb , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "use it like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or your thumb .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when we had the wheely remote control , we it was on the top , if you held it like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , were there buttons on there as ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that what they do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we just used the top part .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so but it could be pretty small .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like , you want it to be large enough that you can but can't you just get , but , do you need that ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what if , you had like cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like you so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast like that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the options are there but they're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do what i'm talking about though ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like , just something , that you can flip over , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like something on the side where you slip panel down and it's got whole bunch of .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can have it on the settings , no ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you can get to , if so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the t_v_ screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the thing is if we can do this , that'd probably be , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that keeps it really .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you wouldn't don't think you would even need it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so mean you can do it , you it's it doesn't seem that hard .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we have to look into the , like , the programming , how this how they actually programme these things , and if that's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how they make the menu show up on the t_v_ ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it would that would be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they already do it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the t_v_ , not inside the remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i've never bought remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television , which is little my i've never bought just remote , like , so don't really know .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they usually are .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but so , but it's i've never had hard time with like my remotes , like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it always comes with the t_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and don't think that should be too hard .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it most of the ones we've had have had the menu button , 'cause it's not like you need to have button access to like change the contrast .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause it just doesn't come up every day .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , do we need .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have to think about but you just need the output signal to be able to bring it up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's what it does anyway .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out , because the problem with buttons is you like , they have these abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand , and never get it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you they mean , it's like .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so on the telly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , but , you mean if we have this screen like the ipod screen ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or on the t_v_ too .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "on the telly , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , the touch-based graphical interface is really idea because it is so obnoxious to like have to push those like now hit this , you have your little guide out and you're like , hit this button twice , like to activate the date .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it is technologically innovative in way , so that fits with the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it is trendy , the ipods are really hot now , so , by web research , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "did you get that pc picture on did they provide you with that picture on the web ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's quite interesting .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what are we going to do about this vegetable thing that i'm dreading ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was gonna say .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you said people want spongy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one of your one of the material options is rubber that's in like those stress ball things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , that would be spongy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", that would be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just feel , but hate spongy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's that would be , usually like the touch pad things are hard plastic typ mouse type , thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but what if we ha what if we had like spongy like stress balley kinda so you're like or what if we integrated the what if the whole thing about the fruit and vegetables we somehow made it tactilely fash , we tapped into that , so like it feels like vegetable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "definitely the area round it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it could work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "could be like mobiles that just you just put cover .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't 'd want it to feel like banana .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it's small thing , you instead of creating an object for it that looks like banana , which frankly i'm not particularly fond of , you could just have covers and then your mobile it's like mobile phone thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you had there was time when they had all these different covers for mobiles .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit , apple machine and they have like the blueberry , like all the colours are named after fruits .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you could name it after fruits and vegetables , or .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it could the colour can fit your sitting room , so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry , and then if you have green one you can have .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what if what this is i'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , colours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you have like that stress ball material as what you're actually holding in your hand , so like what you're feeling is comfortable , and then there's more of hard plastic thing where that thing is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that 'cause i'm thinking of silver because those are our company colours .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how are you how are you all envisioning by what we've just the feedback we've just got about the ball ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "unfortunately they don't have silver fruits and vegetables .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's in the shape of fruit , like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "know , squashy ball .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "relaxing squashy ball .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that you can see you're thinking , it's weird , you're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you're thinking you change the hard bit and i'm thinking how do you change the hard would you put sticker ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because was thinking if you have cover for the squashy bit , like , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is just .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "say that's the say that's the squashy bit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was thinking of getting cover for which is cheaper .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that see was thinking this was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that's your actual thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if it's cheaper actually .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and like this you could have like you could have like cherries and things around there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like that shape .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but was thinking if it was like this 'cause the way you were describing the ipod and the thi the roll thingy it's almost like your thumb is farther up , so if you could squish it lower then , you meant , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was thinking single ball shape .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you're holding squishy ball and then it has .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's like it has to be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it wouldn't be very big in either like how big ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this big , and then you just do that , suppose .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what if , what if the squishy , so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable , and you can so one you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing and you could get you could have your choice , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just li 't des like condom thingy , like cover .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the question is , which one's easiest to change and we can just contact our relevant department for that , and just see what the cost is for covering that or covering that , and for now we can do two prototypes and then hi try and ask users what the best is , and no .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's nicer to have drawing 'cause it's neater .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's not very neat , but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the handhe the handheld part is definitely so you could make that into the fruit and vegetable part .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it's bit like those juggling balls , you can change shape according to your to the way you hold it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you could squish it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it's got sand in it , you it just moulds to your hand .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so where are the fruit and vegetables now ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "fruits and veg .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front , or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the rest is the company colour's silver ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it was , silver and yellow .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it looks like don't .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could promote the banana one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's another question , where are we gonna we should have the logo somewhere on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should also fit the batteries , which we haven't .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the batteries would have to go under the plastic case .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that would that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "especially if you're switching out the squishy part .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then you need to have the other part just be single unit that you can snap off .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", it'd be interesting to have the squishy bit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the part that you , can change into the different , trendy vegetables and fruits .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then you'd get new one and you'd have to do it all over again .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no but it does it automatically .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "does it automatically ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if someone components concept .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that was me .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was that you ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what but what do we know about energy ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're gonna use batteries ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and dynamo , which is something what it is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and batteries sound good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "something to do with torches .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "dynamo is , it's bicycle .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's bicycle mechanism .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's the en it's like if something moves , when it moves , it stores energy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the other one was the other one was kinetic thing where you'd have to wind it yourself .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so picked battery .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's quite sweet .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could have talked about doing wind-up or dynamo or solar power .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it seems little weird for living room anyways .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what does everyone else think ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the dynamo would be interesting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but dynamo the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it creates energy on its own .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what about kryptonite ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which is quite .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if you throw it , it's gonna store loads of energy , and you don't need to buy battery 'cause they're quite find them annoying .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we need to find cost .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "didn't have enough data to actually all it said was it gave relative , some chips are more expensive than others , things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "does anyone have costs on the web ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it didn't give me any actual cost .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "most of the is pretty cheap though bought in bulk .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so don't t's that much of problem .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like the chip is probably the most expensive part .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what does chip on print mean ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for things like remote controls , they stamp out chip , calculators too .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can mass produce pretty cheap .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it's not like computer , you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls , it's like stamped onto the chip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , chip on print is just means like that they're mass-produced .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's what we've been talking about , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "case is what we were discussing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "thinking of like syntactic case and thi let's see .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is there anything else we need to talk about ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when we move on , you two are going to be playing with play-dough .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you'll get more instructions from your personal coach .",
