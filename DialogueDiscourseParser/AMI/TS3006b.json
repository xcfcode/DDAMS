the buttons as user-friendly as possible .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and also there's so not only the design of the bus buttons but how you can push them , and like that .", "speaker": "D"},

"present and the colours .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can't change much of that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do we have .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so but don't think that's problem

should use an advanced option .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device , only your television .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's very easy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so there are not extra options in this case , but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have to make it fashionable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like you said before .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the basic functions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "only use extra function if they are really needed .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can hide them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what we can do with the screen is all the configuration options , you can put that in the screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you make screen menu .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the screen menu to do that , and then the basic function just on the device itself .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen , with

up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it didn't say what they want to do with the screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so but what did the marketing no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my is it's pretty handy for advanced functions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "with no predefined we're back online .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like searching for channels and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "searching for channels , programming them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have your never mind .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's i'm al i'm almost finished so the we have to watch out for the if we make it very fashionable , it the functional functionality will go down .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we have to make compromise between functionality and fashional fashionable content and form .",

sucky .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can improvise ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which one is it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would be it then .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we can go for so we can go for the look-and-feel of the left example , and then screen on top of it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have no idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you didn't put it in ?", "speaker":

"A"}, {"text": "alright how do skip pages ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was working on this before got my information .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about remote controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the info on the website which came too late .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so didn't really functions we had to put into it yet .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is an overview of what we discussed in our last meeting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "those were my starting points .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was working on schedule , and was supposed to do it like this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then the information came and it was exact with all the steps in the remote control that had to follow , so was trying to organise them for myself .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then make the design , the actual design , but never came around to do that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i'm not really what i'm supposed to say about it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "everything speaks for itself .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "mean you press button the it tru goes , it sends signal to chip , which translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and or temporal fr frequencies actually .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then through transformer , it the signal gets boosted and then sent to the receiver on the t_v_ and the t_v_ will translate it into function .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this was actually all got around to do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if i'm too slow for this , but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "shou should we make list of the of all the functions we want .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we want to incorporate in into it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for those that didn't see yet the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext , only for t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it should be designed for use group below forty , but don't t's wrong if we can target the current customer group as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we have to decide on the functions , and on the , let's see what was it , the target group .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to make be clear what that is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "group of users , or because it says below forty .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's easy but it's below forty so we can decide where to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's the tar or male and female six the marketing research started on the age of sixteen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's also for children or just .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "sixteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , thirty five to forty five , something like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so how do you mean ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so below forty is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we need an lower level which to focus .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so is it from sixteen to forty ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it from twenty to forty ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it from thirty ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "sixteen to forty .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "people of sixteen are quite used to technology .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have to and if we have larger public we have more options to sell our product .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so they adapt to it pretty soon .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what we might wanna do is cust have customised the screen functions , if what .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the younger users are more acquainted with these machines so they can use more advanced functions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but elderly people don't understand it so , so they need simpler remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that you can choose what the design displays , or wha whatever .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's why wanted to make two different groups of functions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the simple functions for the whole public , and the advanced options for the younger people who are more experienced with na should put the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but all incorporated in the screen or just on the remote itself ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like you have visual of the brightness with sliding bar and bus and like that for sound and vis and visuals ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so is you should have menu for all the functions you don't use regular and which are .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can make if you make drawing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and draw it very big .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , it doesn't have line control , so we get the remote , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is it's alright the remote ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "usually the power button is on top .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is on top .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which should be easy , easily reached with the thumb .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it should fit in into your hand .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "left top or top ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "most people are right-handed so left-handed special addition , but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you put it like here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then you could put screen , like on mobile phone , also on top .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but if you are using the normal functions , the basic functions , you normally press them on the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do the also with the thumb .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it should be little bit longer so that you can put your thumb , also reach the middle .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or you should screen at the bottom and then you can see it very clearly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you have it in your hand , and the screen is below , and the buttons are in the middle .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you need to be able to hold it so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you put the screen here , it's more about the functions now than the layout .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's for the 't help it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "doesn't work too .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you broke it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you get it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you put all the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you want the normal piece of paper ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you have pen ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and might be easier ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like if you have like ten buttons for all the for all the channels , and here one for that usually like here , here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the for flipping up and down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and volume control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you have up and down for the channels , and left and for the volume .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and left to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and those can also be used for the menu .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but this is really your department , that we need just the functional display and four cursors .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but this is function so if you can use them for multiple things for the menu .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you have most of the time you have one button in the middle .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it says menu , and then if you press it you the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down and left and to go into functon and then just mo most of the time this menu button is also like , to confirm action .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you scroll into it , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you select function like bass .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you just adjust it with these two buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then to confirm , and then on each screen there's there should be an option to go back to upper level .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then finally say , exit .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or one button to exit it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in one time , that's not really my department .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's more your department to .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and do we need logo on our remote control , or on the left top .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it should be if the screen is here then the logo should be like on top , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that depends on where you put the screen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it's essential that there is screen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the position of the screen is also more essential than we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and for the speech recognition part , if we want to incorporate that , we need microphone .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but so it should be if you have it in your hand here , should be on top somewhere , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this would be no that's not so we need display .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "why did we wanna put the display in the bottom ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's not but it's screen on top looks more lo logical to me .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "may because you're but only for the basic functi if you're going to use the advanced option , you're going to press the menu button and then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because if you use the functions your hand will block the display .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "normal for logical .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also because people use mobile phones and they also have the screen on top .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they're used to it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you just have to reach little bit for the power button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you grab it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "on once it's on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but most of the times if t_v_'s on standby people just press channel to put it on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you don't need the power button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we put it on top .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we put this on top , and then make the corporate logo like over here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the microphone , it can be very small .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you look at your mobile phones are some stripes , little holes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "on the top or even on the side .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on the side .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if the microphone is good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but then it's possible that you cover it with your hand so that top is the best option .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so on the top is better .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but if you hold the ma the remote like this , if you put it on the top on the side .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "should be able to work .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "depends on the sensitivity of the microphone , but that's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can we leave this up to you ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it doesn't matter that much .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so but the screen is on top ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which functions did we have left ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is numbers , volume , channel up and down .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "channel up and down , and the control of the advanced options .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "screen is over there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it , we should decide what advanced options we want to put in the screen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we it it's just remote control so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's good one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we needed to integrate the sound and image options ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like bass so we need an equaliser .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you treble , middl middle , bass .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if you have sound but not too advanced .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "most t_v_s use only treble and bass .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and they're not used often so just sounds .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's pretty hard to write .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you have sound ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just you have digital better write it down over there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you have sound .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm just secretary .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "sound and then within sound treble and bass ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the mono stereo option ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "pitch believe , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and there was something else also .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then pitch .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but pitch , isn't that that's the height of the tone .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the fr the frequency of the tones , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wh why would you use that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and mono stereo .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "isn't that depends on the signal of the of what program you're watching .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if people like talk like .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and also the tuning part ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we have sound , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so channel programming ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and in the functionality of the no of the remote do we want the buttons to make sound when you press them ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as confirmation or whatever ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it gets annoying .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "most mobile phones used that in the beginning but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could make an option for it , but you can disable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "under the advanced option menu you can put those things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the television itself has also the options brightness and screen colour etcetera .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but people don't want to sit on their knees on their knees in front of their television with only three buttons then it's very hard to contrast and brightness ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so contrast , bright , and the others were in your presentation ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "those are the most used .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you look at your monitor .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so just copy those ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that these were the only ones , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but so we have t_v_ options , which is all this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "will look it up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the button options and the options .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the sound , sound and image .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you have in that the remote control options .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we need two menus thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have button menu , which you can use directly , according to the old principle .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the options are activated by some software options , thats communicates with the infrared decoder .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with the chip and then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you have an additional processor and software part .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have power button , whether that's present .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "channel volume selection present .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "audio settings , mono , stereo , pitch , bass , treble .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "screen settings , brightness and colour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "call it contrast .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "con contrast is , colour and brightness .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "make it colour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and what you say , channel settings or channel programming ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you have an option to start scanning all the frequencies , and when it encounters one , shows on your t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then you can and then you can select number in your remote on which you want to save it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so i've channel program is autoseek ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "name channel , or they get automatic names , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "most t_v_s automatically display the name , which they get through the cable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you only have to choose the position on your it only has to match the channel frequency on your t_v_ , with the position on your t_v_ and so your remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but can you also say want veronica on the channel number five or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you already programmed it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you want to move it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that should be possible too .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how do you call that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how do you call that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you should be able to browse through list , which displays all the values , all the channels which are possible .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like one to thirty of or ninety or whatever .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just browse through it and then in some way see if it is programmed .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can call it that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "swap's good option .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you most of the time if you swap it let's say you have r_t_l_ five on channel five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and veronica on channel eight and you want to move veronica to channel five , most of the times you override the previous one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's 's up to mister user interface designer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's pretty you have to look on the menu on the t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's you're but also , which buttons you have to press to get certain result ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "he only has to figure out how it has to look .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and how to use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the working design was to specify how ph the physical interation between the components was , as believe .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you did your homework .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or is it too hard to ju to just do it all on your remote ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to programme the channels ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no that's on the can you make map with all the 'cause it's now there are lots and lots of documents and the layout of the remote control ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it should be able to do any remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the communication with the television is difficult .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that's not our part .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we don't have to design protocol so no that's the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we have figure out way to do that easily .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the autoseek is not problem .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you current channel and then it just says , on which number do you want to save this , and you just press number on your remote , and then say confirm , and then it's saved .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's easier , it's harder to , if you have already programmed it , to swap .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we have to think of something for that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so but the user interface designer can design menu for all these function put them on the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "structure into layers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll just try to reorganise things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so and the layout of the thing itself .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you design the basic function menu for the screen ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the layout of the screen and you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the screen itself on the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "isn't that more the user interface part ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no that's more in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "all the functional aspects of the remote are in my department .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have to it has to do , so if you wanna the changing the channels thing is , have to integrate that in the design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so he's layout and you're function .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's good separation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but do have to make the menu layout also ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or are you going to do that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm going to make .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's your department yes , because he already knows what .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to work together .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if make the menu like , have to state which function has to be in the menu , and then you have to decide , it's , in way that is user-friendly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we're not allowed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you are going to make list of what functions are going to be on the screen , the menu screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and i'm going to make menu with pages and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "with some layers in it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so some menus .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and also make clear which buttons to press to get certain result , because that's always the difficulty .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "every device has its own menu .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this button , the , menu .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or you can incorporate two difference different buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like for your mobile phone .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this is only for to get in the menu , or to exit it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then one to confirm , and one to go one step back .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's like the save button on your mobile phone , if you have nokia or like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or the no button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to go one step back you it's only two extra buttons , but if it if it's very clear that they are for the screen because this is used for both .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have to group , to make two groups .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the one group for the display , and one group for the basic functions , and but we have but that's not if you're zapping with your remote control , you can press the menu button , and then you are suddenly into the display .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but they're incorporated ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "up and down is smart ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "into your screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you should leave the menu button out of here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you wanna separate .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and just put it under the screen , the screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "put it on top .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just group the we make these the advanced functions and these the basic functions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we make line between them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we should place the screen on top , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that's jurgen's department .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we make it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you just find out and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you just make the layout .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you do we do the extra two buttons or not ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you put too many functions in one button it gets confusing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we have menu button and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and to , and back , also .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and back button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or confirm and back .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the four arrows .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but those are still doubly used .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should we save this picture , or what it looks like ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm not clear about the extra two buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have menu button and that's the one with the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that just to activate the screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so and then with these buttons , woa , you navigate .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "menu button access the menu in the screen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can navigate .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you can also navigate the channels .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the volume .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that that's not that those are multifunctional .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "those are both .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it interesting for users if we put led lights under the buttons ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that if you press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's very good idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then it's also easier to integrate several functions in one button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's good idea because then it becomes clear which buttons are active now , which you can use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so those buttons are lit up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but just one thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "should we use those two ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or only this to scroll ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then use the two functional buttons to confirm , to go into something ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no we have to use this to adjust some bars ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "keep it optional 'cause you can go left to and up and down in one menu .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we should use this also as an button , still .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then just only back button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have those buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the pr the problem with the button in the middle is , is if you're pressing up and down , you can easily press the once you , when you're not already at your choice .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we use all four .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so make one button and one navigation button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and one back .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that was already decided .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the with the channel and the volume multifunctional navigation button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's what we decided earlier on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so wanna close down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you wanna close down ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have to , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not because don't like you but yh we have lunch break , and then we can work for thirty minutes , and have to write very fast to make the minich min minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we'll see .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how long is the lunchbreak ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have to ask .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "nobody told me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but do we have to write down the our now ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or first lunchbreak ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no believe there's first lunch break .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because i've everything in my head now so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or you can just ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can put the laptop back in the room and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's lot of pressure .",
