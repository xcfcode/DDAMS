"speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as usual we will follow the project method that we are using in the in our company .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it is in three step as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first the functional design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the second's conceptual design , and then the detailed design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "during each step of each design we wi you will work separately , individually on your specific tasks and will we will meet to discuss and take decisions about what you've you did and what we will do next .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so first , we have to train ourself with all the tools availables in the in this meeting room and particularly the white board so we are going to go through the white board and take some notes or do some drawings .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so who want to start ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no one else wants to , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , want me to draw my favourite animal .", "speaker": "B"},

have one in mind ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the spider has spider lives in web and it has eight legs , and it can move all about the web in two dimensions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "unless it's three dimensional web which they have sometimes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there are some spiders that live in like that have like big ball of web .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the other thing is some spiders can actually fly like they have they let out like stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like parachute so they can actually go and find new build new web somewhere else .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so they did this in charlotte's web that movie that little t's actually book first but at the end all the spiders kinda flew away .", "speaker": "B"},

"speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but don't you t's very difficult to draw panther ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so bad don't like it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it would be very funny for us .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's friendly panther .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's happy 'cause it just ate someone .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "actually , honestly what's his it's be behaviour , if it's the male who hunts or it's the female , have watched that lions di didn't hunt it's the female lions who hunt , so but like it because it's fast , and it's black as , so it can he it can hide

"C"}, {"text": "so , not the favourite animal , but i'll draw elephant .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll try to draw elephant .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , elephant goes like this , and then it has four feet .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "whether there's any dist there should be any distance or not , but this is the easiest .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then we have it's trunk .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and something like this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "an eye , cute .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so and sometimes they have hump .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it seems that elephants are pretty friendly and they have one very important way different way of walking .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so when they walk , wherever they are going to put their first feet , the second feet will always be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when they'll come to that position the second , the third feet will be there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the way they walk .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that's very peculiar about them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "none of the other animals walk like this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they are very useful to human beings .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "at least few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportations , or when they had to carry huge loads from one place to another , elephants were very useful .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they are found in usually the warm countries .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they are the biggest terrestrial animal .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's what know about them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , that's what wanted to tell about elephants .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so is this an indian or an african elephant , 'cause you haven't

african have two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then there's difference in the trunk of the animals , these elephants who are indian and so at some for some elephants it's the trunk is having one do we have some message there ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have to catch you , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "some other time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have to go through the meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can discuss that off-line .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we'll discuss fly or do we'll do another meeting abo on elephants .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so another important part of the project is about money , and about so about finances .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we should target selling price of twenty-five euro for this remote control and we have which would generate profit of fifty million euros , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we should target the inter an international market .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so could ask one question , is this stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's gonna be you already have t_v_ but you're buying an extra remote control for it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is the next topic we have to discuss exactly , so let's go to it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we should decide which remote control we want to we want to we want to go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should be should it be specific remote control to some specific device ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should it be universal one ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'm waiting for your inputs very quickly because we have only three minutes to go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , it seems the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make , which seems to little strange if we what the product is yet , but if that's the requirement that we need to design the product to actually fit that price bracket so , we're gonna need to find out what's actually , what people ar are willing to pay for what product they're expecting for twenty-five euro because it seems quite lot for remote control , so it's .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is more job to our market person .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it should be the topic of the next meeting just to have an overview of this and in which direction we should go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we need to close the meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll have new meeting soon and so the work every of you ha have to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you have to work on the working design , you have to work on the technical functions , and you have to work on us user requirements specs , alright ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you will receive some information by emails , as usual .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for coming today .", "speaker": "A"}], "id": "xxxxx", "relations": [{"y": 1, "x": 0, "type": "Explanation"}]}]
