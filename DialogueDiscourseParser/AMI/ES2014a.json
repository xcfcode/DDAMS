"speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm not exactly what you mean by tool training .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "see , so we shouldn't really be , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we have the project team , which is to come up with new remote control device .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have the starting base was the original which has been in existence now for period of time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and our idea is to make the new remote control device more user friendly than the previous one , and to be trendier , to be with it , and therefore to get bigger market share and bigger audience .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so method of doing this is split up as you can see into the functional design , the conceptional design , and the detailed design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so in each of these phases we'll be handing over to yourselves , the designers of this device .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and having meetings so that we can during the course of the day come up with better inst implement than we had before .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and therefore have successful conclusion to the day .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you'll be doing various designs throughout the day to meet this end .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we've got tool training .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "try out whiteboard .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we will .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so everyone's to supposedly draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is make the whiteboard works .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so who wishes to go first .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you wish to go have first bash at whatever .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "good job got pockets today .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "your microphone's just .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but now you you'll move out from the microphone and the camera .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "take it that would so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are we supposed to do this now , do you think , or ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or technical problems .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you've lost your microphone there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "here we go .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you designers are meant to come up with these things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "little smiley cat there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and this would be because they're very independent , they're very intelligent , compared to dogs .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they can be very affectionate .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "some people don't but know very affectionate cats .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they can look after themselves .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll shall see if get across without just tangling everything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "shall rub that out , actually ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't see as there's any need to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's plenty of space .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can have whole menagerie .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we've had more time to prepare over this side , so we've all stuck our bits and pieces in our pockets .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "didn't think of that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "pens are over here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the three pens are underneath .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll try the red pen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm gonna go for the bear which i'm be able to draw very , but i'll have bash at it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you get marks for artistic impression .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "lost it there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i've just knocked the microphone .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you're just doing the face .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll then we'll go for small bear .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and like my animal that looks nothing like bear because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear like the jungle book characters and like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm gonna go for the dog , and i'm gonna draw one badly as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "looks like it's going to be dachshund .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's quite good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's my dog .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like dogs because they're very loyal .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and they're always happy , so whenever you're feeling bit down or tired , they're always coming up and they're always quite excited .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you can always have lot of fun with dog .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and they're also good for exercise as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can sorta get out and they sorta never get tired .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and when they're tired they're quite cute as , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's why like dogs .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'ve not actually had too many pets over my time 'cause to be honest with you i'm not too keen on them anyway .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not to worry .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got few fish and so hopefully won't prove too difficult to draw .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as you can see that my artist artistic work is useless as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and one of the best things about fish is that they don't really take too much looking after because with most of the animals if you're going away on holiday or whatever , you've gotta spend money or get friend or whatever to look after them for you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "whereas if you got fish , you just gotta put the food in dripper feed which feeds them over the couple of weeks that you're away and change the water every couple of months , and buy in few plants , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "other than the fact that they keep dying , fish are not are reasonable pets in that they're low maintenance .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we're still all with us .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "work has been done on this project where by twenty five euros is the expected selling price .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that information has come from our marketing manager here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're looking to sell internationally , not just in europe .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're looking at having our production costs limited to twelve and an half euro per unit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and therefore making profit margin of not actually profit margin it's because you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to take from that to give you your profit margin per unit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so depending what the overhead costs are will determine how many units we're looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so experience with remote control , first ideas .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're looking at having discussion at this point in time to help you folks design our new model as it were .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so any thoughts ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with some remote controls the buttons were little small so they're quite hard to press so we make something with easy to press buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as that is the main function .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we're looking for some we're looking for device that is robust and therefore won't get damaged too easily .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're looking for device that is what was the other things you said there ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "easy to use so the buttons are accessible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "easy to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is easy to use and see .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is this just television remote ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because lot of systems are t_v_ video combined now , or t_v_ d_v_d_ combined .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if you've got combined system , it could be combined remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or is it just television that we're supposed to be doing ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll get back to you on that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it seems to me sensible , 'cause as you rightly said , there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the room .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so device for all remotes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one of the things we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause there's quite often lots and lots .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and sometimes they remote controls defeat their own purpose because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so whereas in the past you'd have to get up to change the channel , now you have to get up to pick up the remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so don't we need to think about how we could develop remote control which moves around the room .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "comes to your whistle .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's something for the future when you can talk to your television , but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but is it in sense it's mutually exclusive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can't have both the one device and then have few buttons on it to 'cause you want simplicity as , you want any idiot to be able to use it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "whilst at the same time you want , as you rightly said , one remote for all .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so these are probably mutually exclusive options that you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes , therefore they're more with handling them , therefore you can make them more complicated as time goes on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could have better instructions with the remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself , or the instructions that would come with it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we've done some research about what the cutting edge hand held devices are , and lot of them use they're like mini laptops .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's possible that we could devise system where you're holding miniature computer which is controlling all your television , your stereo , and where if you buy new thing then it you can link it to that as , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'ve got five minutes before the end of the meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we have to start winding up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is there next meeting in thirty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , so we've got i_d_ the come on , where's my there we go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you just click return it should be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it'll get rid of the message .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you hit just hit return and it should get rid of the message .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's what was looking for .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we've got function what happened to the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that might be back to the start .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you grab the slide to the left and pull it down ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we've got the working design for i_d_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for u_i_d_ the technical functions design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "marketing , the user requirement specification .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are we all clear what objectives we're looking to meet in the next thirty minutes ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and i'll try and write up some minutes of this meeting to give it to you for the next meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is this mun multi-functional one or do we decide that ourselves as we go away and work on it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you just said at the start it was television remote control , so we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "television remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's true , 'cause during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change where we're going .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but at this point in time you're that shall we make it just t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we will depart .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we will stay here and break off .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and i'll do minutes and we'll see you in half and hour .", "speaker":
