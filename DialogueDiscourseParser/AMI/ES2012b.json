[{"edus": [{"text": "welcome to the second meeting of this design group .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll briefly go through the notes of the last meeting just done in note form and haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as team here and nobody's working equally , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we saw that the problems with existing remote controls were the boring shape and boring colour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we saw that the what we needed to do was to make the device controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at anything in particular , that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it , illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that people might want it as in addition to their existing remote controls .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that it sh it should just always work , whenever you use it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that it shouldn't be too small , that it gets lost .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now i'll shortly ask for three presentations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "before do that , however , will go through some new project requirements that the management have placed on us and will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this and the they don't necessarily agree with what we thought .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we'll as result of that we will then talk through the functions that we see the device actually carrying out , and we have forty minutes to do this in and anyway .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now , the new requirements are the management team see that teletext is no longer of any importance given the rise of the internet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and they want it only to cover televisions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now , what is not quite clear from their directive is whether they mean they don't want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover , videos , d_v_d_s , satellite boxes , which we saw as being fundamental to the exercise .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and on that basis we need to bear that in mind , but possibly keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they no longer they don't look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the logo being at the bottom of the screen there , the two r_s in grey against yellow background .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the market .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but do introduce some constraints as to how we might do that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it also has to be simple , which to some extent goes along with the first one , and that we've already said that it must be simple 'cause that's what people want anyway .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly , which is their choice , but we need to talk that through .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so after the meeting it'll be summarised and notes sent out and etcetera .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we'll first of all have individual reports from everybody .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "again there is no order of precedence here so i'll leave it up to you to who thinks they would like to go first ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can steal the cable ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "got how do start there ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you click on the one that looks like projection screen , no the one to the of that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "these are functionality requirements from the our down in the research lab .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what is needed by people and what they want to see .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are how mu how often they're used and how much their necessary and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and general opinions about current remotes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "see that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so some new style should be incorporated that's less ugly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "along with looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which is plus for us , if we can make it look better , it'd be more cost effective and we can put the price up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "empl kinda take that to mean as they don't they , they only use they only work for the television or like as in my flat i've got six remote controls for stereo system , digital box , d_v_d_ player , video player and t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it was my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched to my behaviour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "again , seventy five percent is seventy five percent of users say they zap lot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "took to mean that they just they use it lot , they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause wh if we got remote that like 'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but and we're going to see on the that some of the functions like audio settings aren't hardly ever used and used very aren't considered relevant by the user .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and frustrations of like people losing remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "some system of you press button on the t_v_ or that's it would have to incorporate , but like some system where you can use something else to find the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like it'll beep .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , the time taken to learn new remote controls is don't want to make it too complicated , easy to use for new like first time users and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and repetitive strain injury , suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use have to make it , fewer buttons , like was saying about the whole mice the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't even have to hold it as such .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "gosh , must be some telly addicts out there if they get r_s_i_ from their television remote , is all say .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it also asked if we would if people would pay more for speech recognition and younger people say they would .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and there was another section on our on the report for displays , but the data wasn't there , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't actually the results for that were , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "may be incrementally emitting , but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "must say that the can't remember what phone service was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition which worked remarkably , so that is thought and it cuts out was gonna say , you can't get lot of r_s_i_ , just get jaw ache .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it would cut out the r_s_i_ as you , so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i've got some other things couldn't fit onto this presentation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you see this ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll read out to you .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "functionality , like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so like the power .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "using the swi the power switch to switch on t_v_ is high relevance of nine , but it's not frequently used .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you see what ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "whereas channel selection , which is very high relevance is used the most .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we can even start to cut down on or was possibly even thinking of design that some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like folding ledge .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that we can go into the channel settings and the audio settings , which are low relevance and rarely used .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and keep the volume selection and channel selection very easily .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it could be was just gonna say like the flip phones that they use ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have you seen the new mo mobile phones that flip out and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side , so you could have the most used buttons on top and flip it out .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like the one that like slides back and the buttons are concealed underneath .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "should we actually bite the bullet here ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if people really don't use those buttons to any extent remove them altogether .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just remove them completely ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that might be the , have big like the satellite box or the cable box and have it just go on the t_v_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , you won't lose it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we could actually have we could actually have remote control with wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons if we went for voice recognition , given that the now the age structure we were looking at we had usage by age structure , what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now do we know whether they forty no for forty five to fifty five age group , to put myself in the middle of it , use remote controls to extent .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes we that would 've speech recogn .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no this is for pay more for speech recognition .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , we're looking at again , we the relative proportion the relative numbers in the age groups .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control would be it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the only problem think of with that is if you've got lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you just take away everything that they're used to knowing , that's gonna be quite change .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if you just lift it up and say , channel one or b_b_c_ it see technical problems with that in terms of the , the sound from the television , because if somebody actually on the television says , i_t_v_ and you're watching b_b_c_ then it might change itself , so it probably needs to be possibly actually need button on it just to activate it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or even you could even just have it left on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you could just put it down once on top your t_v_ and never have to .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then just say , thought and then that would certainly be truly different .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause audio settings , nought point eight percent .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if they weren't there , would people miss them ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but look at the importance of them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the volume settings .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "relevance of two out of ten , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "vol volume , yes we need to identify things that people actually need and it's function of frequency and relevance .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they're not used often but they are quite important when they're used .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment , the channel and volume and given that we've been told to ignore teletext .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "channel and volume are the only ones that would appear to be essential .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we if we can design something that looks interesting , know , or looks different , incorporates the logo and the colours and we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's the yellow and grey , and , buttons or buttons as an option .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "had thought actually , to interrupt .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you were saying about it could technical problems of like someone on the television saying channel number and it changed we could have like an activation word .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause i've seen this used on computers before , where you just you address the remote , you address the computer , and then give it command .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you cer certainly could .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "depe depends whether if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say b_b_c_ one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you could print actually print it on the device itself .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this that's always gonna be problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so suppose one could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "anyway , carry on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you want to just carry on with or no , no was in the middle of in the middle of your report there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no interrupted you , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was just kinda wrapping up there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was thinking , such things are relevant .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could make things much more the eighty percent of people would spend more on remote that looks better , combined with decrease the or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and it might turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , since if we're marketing more fashionable approach then it'd it would be fashion and fashion over practicality .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it 'cause we're certainly could .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we , we could even have it as like the buttons control this and the voice functions control the things that you would do all the time , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , if we could power on and channel selection and volume selection , wouldn't have to really and probably it would look better as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it , visually very distinctive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause , it does not have to be oblong box .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "lined with numbered buttons and , that's everything .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "who , have you finished there andy ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "given that we've already had extensive discussion .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you want the cable ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's see if make this work .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have to hit like function and something .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it doing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "give it about twenty seconds , or so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is just about the technical functions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the method , looked online of other similar products and then just was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and identify what the necessary things are , what people are what you really wanna have remote control do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then there are two different kinds that found .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's user centred one and an engineering centred one which will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so these are the two different ones .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this one this is the user centred , it has quite few fewer buttons and then this is the engineering centred , which has lot more buttons , and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , what remote control is you it's to send messages to the television set , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the logos for the company and the colours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so , for my personal preferences , this one is easier to use and has quite , fewer buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we want something that sends messages easily to the television and was wondering about this example that they have .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it looks narrow at the top , and was thinking if it were wider at the top , then that would be easier .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the unique style , have it light up so it's visible in the dark , the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible was when we were talking about havi losing it , to have button on the television that you press and it if it makes noise or lights up like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's my presentation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can i'm actually gonna use the it's gonna technical problems over here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm actually gonna use the yes , rather than the traditional , won't even go that far .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they probably clip to you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they might be movable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they're all they're not connected to anything on the table , you just leave on and walk around with .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "something like this shape , something that you can that's more vertical shape , that you hold in your hand , 'm trying to think such as something you hold up like that , possibly with couple of buttons like that , but with the entire top with the , the infrared or whatever source .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that , it's flying off in all directions , so that again the need to look at the technicalities of actually achieving that in terms of whether the , the power requirements of the such source , compromise the our need for , it being permanently , available .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "whether different technology all these remotes are presumably infrared , and like they have been for long time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we possibly need to be looking at something different , short range , not like the old radio remote controls where you'd change next door's telly when you change yours .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if we're going for if minimum number of buttons is our priority , then we should , as say , know , really bite the bullets and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum , possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and nothing else .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that it can al it could almost end up like that , but again , except that the risk of losing it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "anyway so kate , wh what are your thoughts on this ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which one does this plug into ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's all there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'t did you could you see it on you screen when it that's not .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "alright , so i'll just do my presentation on the working design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just at the whole method of how the remote control works .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system , the t_v_ or the d_v_d_ player or whatever .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it does this by , you need to start off you need an energy source and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages within the remote which will then be sent to the television , the d_v_d_ to tell that what to do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you need user interface , which controls the chip and thus the messages and the user interface is that's just you kn the sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just general findings .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what we need technically speaking for the remote control is some energy source , some user interface , which we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "circuit chip within that to control and send the messages and sender and receiver .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is just little schematic diagram of what we're looking for .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this just kinda represents the energy source which feeds into the circuit chip which then we could have that feed into switch which would send signals to subcomponent and on to light bulb between so it'll light up once we start once you start pressing buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "also send signals to the infrared bulb , which will be the part that actually what ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "sends signals to the television .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then you've got your happy little t_v_ watcher there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so my personal preferences think we need sorta big energy source that won't die out , perhaps some rechargeable battery or battery dock you could place it in , so it'd constantly be charged , so you wouldn't have to be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wide range sender-receiver , so that you can hit the buttons from anywhere in the room , and the channel'll still be changed .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "also definitely user-friendly interface and we've all mentioned adding locating device on it , so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions , as they inevitably do , you can find them easily .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that's it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it seems to me there are number of fundamental decisions to make before we your point about the big energy source is very valid one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't suppose we've got any statistics on the life expectancy of remote controls , particularly independent ones .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "given , the number of things you buy these days , which , have lithium whatever battery in , that's , never needs replacing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "perhaps we should have the disposable remote control , one some typical usage .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the battery will last know , five , ten years .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "by which time when all's said and done , the digital television will be taking over in that time scale .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "perhaps we should , know , reduce the , the moving parts even more by not even having battery compartment and , and if anybody manages to run it down , we'll give new one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's , it's what it saves in cost and there there's , it's actually marketing gimmick .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's hardly gimmick , it's practical .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so think the idea of rechargeable one is unless you're really high tech and it just recharges itself if it's by , magnetic waves or whatever , if it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it could have like know like cordless phone in your house it got like base that sits there all the time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are people really gonna use it though ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "people are pro would think that people might forget people forget to put their cordless phones back on there , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's know that somei times my wife goes out in the morning and says should have put the phone on to charge and then she's had those for so long that if she hasn't worked that out by now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause only remember to charge my cell phone when battery dies .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "when it , wh when it's died is problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when it turns itself off , that's when plug it in , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", so what so wh what do we think about the permanent battery ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "think that's good idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that sounds pretty good , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is the , we are really going for the ultimate in ex external simplicity here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "cut cost within the manufacturing and , if we have high tech interior , then that sh may be cost effective .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do they make batteries that last that long ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'t think of anything off the top of my head , but there are certainly things that you buy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they usually have the little light source , what the heck they're called , the but , the little cells that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they have that little solar .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "som some do , but there are battery ones that are , permanently sealed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in i'd , this needs going into the technology bit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "most of them , don't they have combination of the two , like when there is light , they'll work off the light , and if there isn't , they'll kick into this battery , so we can do something like that whereas there is battery , but if there's enough light , then it's using the light , so that it's not actually draining the battery all the time , but you will have the battery there for when you need it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the actual time that remote control is actually operating would is probably , no more than minutes in its entire life .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it depend if it's depends who who's using it , who's just sitting there clicking , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "some people are .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if , but say if people are getting r_s_i_ from it then perhaps we're looking at the wrong market .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then they're clicking lot , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like this market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used , channel selection hundred and sixty eight times per hour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "must admit hadn't i'd missed that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that does sound excessive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then again , if you of the amount of , amount of use it's like that's it's less than second , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and don't even know whether the don't even know whether the signal lasts as long as you actually keep the button pressed , or whether it's just sorta tenth of second , no matter how long you press it for , don't actually know .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "though with digital t_v_ , like know on my cable box , you're not supposed to do that because the channel can't keep up with it if you just press it like that , so you're supposed to use the menu and go through the different channels that way instead of uh-oh .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i've got message to say five minutes , how long ago that appeared .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause we're getting , so i'd need to sum up very quickly here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're looking at extreme simplicity .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're looking at radically different shape .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "possibly no buttons , but if you can incorporate channel change and volume buttons in into the design , then that's fine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in the role of the user interface des designer becomes more important here , because , shape is no longer an serious constraint .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we clearly only need the main buttons , although , if clearly only need the main functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition and the only buttons that we need are channel control , volume control and on off .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it needs to incorporate the corporate logo , the grey and yellow colour scheme and there's no reason why we can't introduce interchangeable covers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so does that accurately summarise what we've discussed ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have one question .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so are we doing just the television or are we doing so not d_v_d_ players , we , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we are doing just the television .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's quite clear from the information that we've been given , no ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like in the email of television only .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they're in the constraints email that got .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "didn't you mention the teletext , just television only ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's one sent you , which was my interpretation of the what came down from head office .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's that that's their view .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can all give some thought to that for the next meeting , very much .", "speaker": "A"}], "id":
