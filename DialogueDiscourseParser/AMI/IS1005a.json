"have to remember it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so good so , let's talk about money .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we are going to sell we want to sell this remote control for twenty five euro .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and our expected profit will be around fifty million euro .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we are trying to have market all around the world .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so not only for switzerland , but for the world .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the we expect production cost of maximum twelve point fifty euro .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "per unit , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we can start today to have first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control , and any idea ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , if you have some experience , good or bad , with remote controls you can share it and say what you what is your idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "from experience , i've had remote controls in the past that have had very they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small , and it's been very hard to use , because there's so many buttons , and it's very hard to see which buttons do what , and the buttons are very small and very hard to press .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and normally you only every use , on t_v_ remote you only ever use , mostly , four or six buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's frustrated me in the past , that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have also some points .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light , so if you are if you are playing with this in the dark room it's probably worth to have something like back light .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it could be also dependant on the amount of light in the room , so that if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so something like this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the second thing , second point from me would be that in normal remote control there is there are two buttons for volume control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but prefer like potential-meter like .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "some slider or not just two discrete buttons for volume , but something which , but reach in one second mute it down , or make high volume .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that because the of the discrete volume levels , or is that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could the volume can go up very quickly and it can , also if when you take the remote control , on the table , you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud , and you have heart attack .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if it drops to the floor then it starts to scream .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it depends what you feel about that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we can think of these things afterwards , but if you have some more notes on that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can do you have something ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just simple experience .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "prefer remote control working with radio waves , because remote control working with infra-red rays you should keep it in specific direction and then try it hard to tune .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "without obstacles and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have meeting in five minutes , so we should hurry .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we will close this meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we will have next meeting in thirty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the so will ask you to do some work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the interface developer will work on the design of the remote control , start to have new idea and read about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which is hamed , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "he's the industrial designer ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , you're the industrial designer .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "am the technical designer , which one , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the first .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the second one is the user interface designer .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then last one's marketing , which is me .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so i'm the first one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , for the user interface designer , which is hamed , you are going to work on the technical functions of the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and for the marketing manager , which is bob , you are going to try to find the user requirements for the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you will receive by email the specific instructions and by your personal coach .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so see you in thirty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}], "id": "xxxxx", "relations": [{"y": 1, "x": 0, "type": "Explanation"}]}]
