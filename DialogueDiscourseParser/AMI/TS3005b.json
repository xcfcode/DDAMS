[{"edus": [{"text": "good morning , again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's see what we can find here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "very warm welcome again to everyone .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here we are already at our functional design meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and this is what we are going to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the opening , which we are doing now , and the special note , i'm project manager but on the meetings i'm also the secretary , which means will make minutes as did of the previous meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and also put these as fast as possible in the project folder , so you can see them and review what we have discussed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if i'm , there are three presentations , each one of you has prepared one ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we will also take look at new project requirements , if you haven't heard about them yet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we have to take decision on the remote control functions and we have some more time , forty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we will need it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "who wants to go first with his presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll go first .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll go first .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can go first , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "shall go first with the users ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "everybody already has his presentation , so you can adjust it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is there an order ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "haven't and one question , your name denni , is it with i_e_ e_i_e_ , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ja precies , ja precies , ja precies e_i_e_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", wanted to explain the working design of the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's possibly very handy if you want to design one of those .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it works as wrote down in this little summary .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when you press button , that's when you do pr when you want to turn up the volume , little connection is made the rubber button just presses on little print plate which makes connection that gives the chips , which is mounted beneath those that plastic of rubber button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "senses that connection has been made , and know and knows what button you pressed , becau the volume up or volume down button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the chip makes morse code like signal which then is si signalled to several transistors which makes which sends the signal to little let .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what let is ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that makes the infra-red lights signal which is sent to the television set .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which has sensor in it to sense the signal of the infra-red .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's how it works .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the findings that found searching up some detailed information about the remote controls , are that they are very easy to produce , it is pis it's possible to make them in mass production because it is as eas it is as easy as printing page , just fibreglass plate is covered with some coatings and chips .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the technology's already available , we don't have to find out how remote controls have to work or how that how to make some chips that are possible to transmit those signals .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "made little animation of about how tran our remote controller works .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we tel there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there is something turning .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's little bug it's in the smart board .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the sub-component , suppose that you understand what sub-component is , is in this example it's the button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when it is pressed down , the switch is ter is switched on , so with the wire is sent to the chip in co-operation with the battery , because to make signal possible you have to have some li ad electronic yes , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "after it's being composed by the chip the signal is transported to the infra-red bulb , and from there it signals morse code-like signal to the bulb in the television set .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wrote down some personal preferences about the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it is very handy if the remote control is hand held , so you don't have to wind it up , or just is it's very light to make to use it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "personally pref prefer that it would be come available in the various colours , and easy to use buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but suppose that the one of the other team members thought of that too .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've got it there too .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it is possible for several designs and easy to use , easy to use buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "perhaps soft touch , touch screen buttons because the rubber buttons are always they slightly they can be slightly damaged , so the numbers on the buttons are not possible to read anymore .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and as said before we can make several designs .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", that's my contribution to this meeting , and two of these this meeting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to this meeting .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "shall go next ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my name's , and looked at technical functions design of the remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "did this by looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they look , and information from the web that found .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what found was that the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set , how you what you described just early .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and this can be all sorts of medsa messages , turn it on , turn it off , change the channel , adjust volume , that thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "play video , teletext , but also play c_d_ if you use it your c_d_ player the remote control will that one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there are some examples of remote controls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can see they are very different .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of buttons etcetera .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the other is more user friendly , little with big buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and not all the you can do with it , but the essential is there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you could better you should look at user centred approach , because the customers have to use them and if they don't t's usable they won't buy it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "lot of buttons they may think from don't need as much as that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "perf personal preferences is simple remote , with the basic functions that you can need that you could use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but keep in mind the new functions of t_v_ what we discussed earlier , split screen and is that function that you should have ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because all the t_v_s will have them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or because of only few and isn't really necessary .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then make it would make so that you can could use it on more than one appliance .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you have one that does with the vi the video , it could also work with the stereo , because play is play and stop and that thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the shu you could reuse the buttons so that you don't have to have lot of buttons for anything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it should be user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that is my presentation .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you must still have it open .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "kijke , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're going to discuss the functional requirements of the remote , that means that functions user want to have on the remote control , or just , and the users , actually .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the methods prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus on more .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then tho that section we're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five years are more interested in fj features like screens , speech recognition etcetera .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , and we possess less than two third , that's two fifth , of the market share in that area .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fifty percent of the users lose their remote often .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we don't have to make it very small , like mobile phone , but some somewhat bi bigger than small , so you don't lose it that much anymore .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly , and fif seventy five of the users zap lot , so the buttons sh should be that small , or shouldn't be that complex because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "important issues about the remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it would be better with personal reference , but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "remote control has to have low power usage , because seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , so the power usage is also one time an hour , or so , with high power usage we would use lot of but batteries .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , so those they those have to be find very easily .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and have to be somewhat like bigger etcetera .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it has also be have to find easily when the label is gone .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "my colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off or would be senden .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if that's the problem , you also have to find it easily on the remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like wh colleagues said , have to be minimalized .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or should be covered , or in screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "screen is easy because we have the screen , we have the various options .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options , so the other options would be gone .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and you don't see the buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so screens should be easy , but an screen , the problem with the l_ sc screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the screen lot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "screen as in touch screen ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "touch screen , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because they use the remote control often more often , and are more technical than the ol older people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the older people spend more money , and easily on remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we have to keep in mind to focus not lot not that much on the younger pep younger people , but also somewhat on the elderly people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and on my personal preferences , don't have any mo more time to come with that , but like said , screen is easily to use because you have you can implement lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it should be easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that is it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "did everyone receive an email with the new project requirements ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then it's good thing that made separate slide of them so you can all read them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "res did not .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "perhaps the rest ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ja , be television .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not in this presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should be in there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "tell you them from my laptop .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's the first thing we should pay less attention to teletext .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the remote control should only be used for the television , otherwise the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time to market , and would make it more costly , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , and new product should reach new market with customers that are younger than forty , and you talked about that before .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products , which means that our corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we have to keep that in mind .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "according to our agenda it's then time to take decision on the remote control functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , who has any idea about what should be on it , and what shouldn't ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you said it should only work with one appliance ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or with one che only the t_v_ ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "only be used for television .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the video also , or not ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "only the television .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "says only for television here , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "makes it lot easier , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , then you can .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "requirements , no ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then it should have on , off , and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for standby options , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the basics then by volume , channel , one till two zero numbers on it , teletext doesn't have to be ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and per perhaps no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes sh button where you can change from one number to two numbers .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "two digits , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can you if that's got name , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "understand what you mean .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's easy to implement button with what which especially do that , because some t_v_s , if you press the one and then the two , it be between five secs it make twelve , and that's not relaxed to user .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it makes it twelve , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not really and there are some models that don't accommodate that function .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so wh the philip's television makes it possible in that to press one and then two to make the tj to reach channel twelve .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that it easy and fast .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but all the television makes use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to get , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you should have that one on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "our main targets' age are ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "forty five plus , or ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "mute misschien also .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "new product should reach market with customers that are younger than forty , and now we have current customers of forty plus .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "forties , because younger people as younger people have now , sixteen till to twenty five age , are eighty one percent interested in screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "from twenty six to thirty five have sixty six percent , and thirty six to forty five , fifty five percent , so to because on most recog remote controls the print plate will be broken how much , two years .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you have to press very hard to go to the next channel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "with the screen it's easier because you only have to wipe the screen to for fingerprint , and then you can use it again .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that collides with our mission to make it very cheap .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because screens are very expensive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "touch screen probably even more .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "an but , do you but if you would do an screen do we have don don't you have any buttons ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , true .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but is it possible to make an screen , how was the information ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it only says that this perce percentage like screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because , and it says that younger age between sixteen and forty five highly interesting features more critical .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so perhaps we should focus on that screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if the only , because our target is sixteen to forty five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but will we not exceed our production is it possible to find out , anyway ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you how much it costs .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you how much it costs , the screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , don't have any costs here , only have percentages .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or because if it only directs at the t_v_ , then you only have what you want to do with the screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , an screen's just like drawn here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just displays several buttons , if you wanted the minimal use buttons , such as channel and volume , you just displays four buttons on the screen and it's possible to press them down , just like touch screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you can , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can adjust which buttons you want on that screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you want to adjust , like , adjust the audio settings , you press audio on the touchscreen and you get the buttons for audio settings , so the other buttons are gone .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can make it possible to do that , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we're going for an screen ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's the most easier thing , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and hoping that when we produce lot it won't be too expensive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "had twelve fifty , for production ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how expensive an screen is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "suppose wi if the mar if our if the young people are interested in screens , we should make .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if that is our market share to and our goal to deliver those remote controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people , but also on the older , and will they use it if it only has an screen ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , forty six to forty five , thirty three percent , and sixty fifty six to sixty five twelve percent .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but our what's it , project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets , to customers that are younger than forty .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so still little bit people .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you don't want to alienate the other but if they also buy it then it's alright .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , that not now , but , so , but market share fro for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it is ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and what else ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "hope we and let's hope to reach those sales .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it , if it costs gets too much , too expensive , then , we should be sticking to rubber buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can you that they will send you some information about the cost of screens .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "nothing , no costs .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if you , so if you receive an email about that , can you post it in the or shouldn't we post that in our projects mail folder .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but perhaps later , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in that should we all get the costs of everything .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't perhaps we should have backup plan that we would use buttons if it's too expensive .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because you are the marketing expert .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", i'll post it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but for now it's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then you have the seventy five percent of users find it ugly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and eighty percent of the users would spend more money with when remote would look fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's bit of problem .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's bit of problem .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "tha it'll look fancy with screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's looks fancy one , of screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but they don't like it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they t's ugly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "when it has an screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just the plain remotes , not specific remotes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright , that you said that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you can make something fancy out of an remote , because it's new , as far as know .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then you have the other thing , that seventy five percent zap lot , but that's not question with the screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then not .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time , to get all the fingerprints off it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what else does our remote need ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the most important things on an remote control are channel selection , volume con selection , and power usage .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and teletext , but that is not of the question .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but shouldn't you put button of for teletext on the for the people who want to use it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "other things are ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it could be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "remembering we have got big remote that you have to fill .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we could make an separate menu on the screen for teletext .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and there's also sh but in sub sub-menu like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and other less important things are screen settings , audio settings , and channel settings , but less important .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they are less important , but they should be there , or not ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "should be there , but not press , sub-menu , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's also important to make it possible to how do you call it in english , to not use batteries , and use ac bat batteries to be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like with mouse , you have not , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can mount the remote control to refill the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in breath it's charted .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we should think of the twelve fifty we have but how much that's going to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we don't have any costs now , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because when you get an screen , you run it on batteries , the batteries will be empty very soon , very fast .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "power supply is one of the most important things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you should perhaps you should be able to switch the control off .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you have an screen that's burns all the time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you shouldn't on and off because that's ver extra , that you have first you have to turn the remote on , and then you can .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and go to standby mode when you don't use it , so that , automatically .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's not that easy because don't think people will like it who that you have to turn it on first and then use it , so it's better when the t_v_ shuts down , the remote shuts down .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but then you can't .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "au automac matically , that it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "after two minutes or three minutes , something like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "after two minutes , two three minutes , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and low battery indicator ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "on the screen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then that before an hour when its get again gets empty .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then you have plenty of time to recharge it , of put it in recharger .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we are going for the recharger .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if it's sensible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because when you're watching t_v_ , you're zapping and you have to put it in recharger , and don't , but then we have to be that the batteries go hours , six hours , five , six hours , then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "when the batteries are low but you'll also forget to put it in , because you throw it on the couch and you don't remember .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , when you when you're done with watching your television , you have to put it , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then you have problem .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you also forget to buy batteries , and then you can you can't use it , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or we have to be that the batteries last couple of days when they're recharged .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the batteries should work lot longer than couple of days , or not ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because you have but you have screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "high power usage .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "high power user cell , it should be standard move to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television , that's also advantage because you can't lose it anymore .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because you are obliged to put it in the charger and not to leave it in couch between some cushions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you made point there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but then you also have to have somewhere where you can put remo recharger near your couch because otherwise you have to walk long way when you twoft want to turn on the t_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "otherwise all your .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just small device .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it hasn't it doesn't have to be big .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "plug it in , that's it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "everything has it for and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like telephone charger .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just cable , or even charger where you can mount it on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "something like that , just .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'ve , you have some more points .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it has to be easy to use also , or things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "market share , speaker re speech recognition .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "functional designs for the elderly you could make it possible to enlarge the screen , so make it possible to not display button at ten points , or but it is one of the functions you have to specify .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that this should be standard .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "large button large buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because we can look at perhaps forty buttons at screen , but the elderly only look at two buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you said something about speech recognition ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it says also .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "twelve euro fifty .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "twelve fifty , twelve fifty .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's an also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five , twenty six to thirty five years , seventy six percent , and thirty six to forty five , thirty five percent .",

the cost of twelve fifty .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "with that , but how would you like to implement that , that you say volume up , and then it goes up , or ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it
