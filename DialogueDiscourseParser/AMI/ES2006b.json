[{"edus": [{"text": "all hooked up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so now we are here at the functional design meeting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "hopefully this meeting i'll be doing little bit less talking than did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the agenda for the meeting , put it in the sh shared documents folder .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if that meant that you could see it or not .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll try and do that for the next meeting as so if you check in there , there's shared project documents folder .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it should be in there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wi on what ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "project documents , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "project documents , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i'll put it in there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is it best if send you an email , to let it's there ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll do that next time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then i'll send them to you after the meeting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "sent at the last minute , i'm about that , but we can see how that affects what you were doing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the last minute , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we've got forty minutes to do that in .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so would say ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you said targ target groups , what does that mean ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we need to , we need to have fairly defined group that we want to focus on and then look at the functions of the dem remote control itself .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so with that it's best if hand over to you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "does anyone have preference for going first ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "go first , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you wanna go first ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "assume we just pull it out ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so from the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back , just so that don't have to scribble everything down .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", afterwards , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so with regard to the working design of this remote control i've identified few basic components of the remote and se from the design , functional design perspective we can now know wha what exactly the components are and how they work together with each other .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is the method that i'll mostly be following in my role .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the identification of the components , and since i'm dealing only with the technical aspects , would need feedback from the marketing person and from the user interface person .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll then integrate this into the product design at technical level and update and come up with new design , so it's cyclical process .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so these were the basic findings from today .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the last three bullets have been integrated from the last minute email .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "quickly jotted them down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the as told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it and what are the different processes and how the parts communicate with each other .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features makes it more comp complex .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the reason why teletext is outdated because of internet and the availability of internet over television .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how however , our remote control would only be dealing with the use for television , in order to keep things simple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also the management wants that our design should be unique it so it should incorporate colour and the slogan that our company has it as its standard .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so he here is functional overview of the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's an energy source at the heart which feeds into the chip and the user interface .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the user interf interface communicates with the chip , so i'll basic go over to the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if this is our energy source and this is cell , it communicates it feeds energy into the chip , which finds out how to do everything .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there is user interface here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so whe when the user presses button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates response and takes the response to an infrared terminal , which then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , which is then communicated to the remote site , which has an infrared receiver .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the there can be bulb here to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so these are the essent so all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do , make the chip more complicated and bigger , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so in my personal preferences i'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this would help us to upgrade our technology at future point of time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and also if we can incorporate the latest features in our chip design , so that our remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most televisions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's about it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so anything that you would like to know or no , don't have any idea about what each component costs .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you have any idea about costs at this point ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause that's something to consider , if we're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so tha , we definitely need to operate within our constraints , but unfortunately do not have any data , so identified the functional components for that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are there any more questions , or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we need like some general discussion at the end probably .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that will do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so do you want to yes , shall we pull this up ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "since we were discussing some design issues then would like to continue , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that has to come out of there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "those last minute things , they're gonna hit you the worst .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "should it just there's just nothing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it'll take some time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it ta takes little , and have you need to then also press on yours , function eight , so the blue function key at the bottom and eight .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "nothin , something is coming up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there it is , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now it's coming , computer no signal .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it'll come up , it no signal .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it says something now , adjusting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my computer went blank now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but don't see anything don't see anything on my computer now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there we go , there we go .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is the problem , but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you press if you press function and that again there's usually three modes , one where it's only here , one where it's only there , and one where it's both .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and one more time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so one more time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "should just for moment , adjusting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's fine , that's good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's start from the beginning .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so i'm going to speak about technical functions design just like some first issues that came up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the method was adopting at this point , it's not for the whole period of the all the project but it's just at this very moment .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "my method was to look at other remote controls , so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what functionality they used .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then after having got this inspiration and having compared what found on the web just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what the user might desire as additional functionalities .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , and then just to put the main function of the remote control in words .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the findings were that the main function of the remote control is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , then the user would like to switch the channel just changing to the next channel to flip through all of the possible channels , or then the other possibility would be that she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and also the volume is very important .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "cou could you go back for second ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "switching on off channel , volume , that's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "among the findings found that most of the curr presently available remote controls also include other functionalities in their design , like operating v_c_r_ , but they don't seem to be able to deal with d_v_d_ players , but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minute update actually we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so my personal preferences would be to keep the whole remote control small just like the physical size .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions like whereabouts you find the on off button and the colour tends to be red .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then , the must-have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then the one thows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but then other functionalities could be just there could be menu button and you could change things on the screen then , brightness and similar functions could be just done through the menu .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , the last question had about whether we wanted to incorporate more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so at the for the time being that's all .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you have questions , and also it's other question is because there are so many different and there are so many different things that could possibly be included because besides video and d_v_d_ there are the video c_d_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to choose between all these possible things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if that was the directive that came through from management , but if we had decent case for that we really t's important to include video and d_v_d_ , could get back to them and see .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's just whether it's worth arguing about .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "are there any questions for clarification of maarika before we go on to the next one ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so in the user interface requirements we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but so at this stage , how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or in we can completely do away with buttons and have some fancy user interface like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but is there any thoughts on that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the buttons are still the most easy for the user to use , what other options would you have ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "little screen , but this would be really lot of learning for the user and the user just wants to get result quickly , not to spend time in like giving several orders .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it'll make the costs .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would think the put the buttons , but if you have other proposals .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the co costs will also play big role when we come to know about them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so can probably until we have more knowledge on that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if the costs allow , we can have like an display and with because we do want something fancy and fashionable as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can discuss that after the next one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you want to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you wanna give me the little cable thing ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "am going in the direction ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "here it comes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm getting hungry .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "here you are .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's why it won't meet .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "try to press , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it plugged in prop it's working ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what have , wh where i've got my information from is survey where the usability lab observed remote control use with hundred subjects and then they gave them questionnaire .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it was all about , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what's the most annoying things about remote controls and the possibility of speech recognition and screens in remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not that they actually gave me any answers on the screens , so should have taken that bit out , but anyway .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , so , definitely you should be looking at something quite different .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "eighty percent of users would spend more to get , looking remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour , as you'll see on the next slide .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what zapping is , but , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's switching between channels , randomly going through .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , so that's going back to what , we were saying earlier about , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , they just make it look ugly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is my little graph thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's bit difficult to see .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", send it to all of you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you explain it to us it'll be fine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what it is it's cones , 'cause they'd be more exciting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but where's it go ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "liked the , liked the litt come back .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what you can't see is volume selection , it's little bit higher than all the others .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the next one along , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what the graph shows is that , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , nobody really uses and so that's the numbers along the top represent their like their importance , so on scale of one to ten , how important is that and , channel selection and volume selection are essential , and the power , t's not quite so essential , although don't understand how it couldn't be , and everything else , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , 'cause they're just not needed , and they're not used .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , so this is what people find annoying about remote controls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that they get lost , that the , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you're watching enough t_v_ to get repetitive strain injury from , watching t_v_ , then that's the least of your problems , but , it's up there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the r_s_i_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages you want something with an ergonomic design that encourages good use of the remote control and , not straining your wrists watching t_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is pink because was copying and pasting the table , and didn't have time to white it out again .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that shows how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can see from that , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite lot more quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they're bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to try it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but do wonder how that would work given that t_v_ , tends to be people talking and , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching t_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so these are my personal preferences .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , so something that's , bit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "functional , so it's useful , but minimalist .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's an important thing that , people use when , when you're filling up your home , lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , and you've got all this , and you're just like , what the hell is that , who is ever gonna use it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , so we need to aim for both .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and , was thinking that solar power would be quite because , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment bit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then like locator , so , like you have for mobile phone or not mobile phone , that's it , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "some ring , some .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "keys and things like that , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "whistle and it screams at you , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "know , it's weird .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my flatmate and were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and was like need to get one for everything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , so something where you clap and then it beeps , something sound that you don't often hear on the t_v_ , 'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes , 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's you , excellent .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's very good , very interesting .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm just gonna tick yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , we've got about ten , fifteen minutes to discuss .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one of the very interesting things that came up in ka kate cat cat's presentation was this issue of like voice recognition being more popular with younger people .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if we need to have target group then as far as the motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and , good looking we are better off targeting younger audience then , people who are comparatively elderly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey , whether , these are the people that will pay more for more stylish remote control , but i'm assuming , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "bu but the survey did say that things like voice recognition are more popular with them , so if you want to put in something stylish , then it'll certainly be more popular with this ye with the younger people as compared to older people , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then again the where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket and the how often they're buying televisions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's when you go to uni , isn't it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you don't have much money , generally .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you share television that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would've thought it's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their toys and it's on , we unplugged it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but still , if you can go back to that slide and , how popular was it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i've unplugged it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you want me to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "here , let me .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's alright , if you can just look it up on your computer , wh people between twenty five to thirty five , how popular was so it was sti still quite popular amongst them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "seventy six point three percent .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it was seventy something , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so even they are seventy six percent , is that high amount ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "kn you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds , but it has been proven that people of that age group have higher disposable income because they don't have like , if you're at university , you're paying your rent , but you don't have mortgage , you don't have life insurance policy , you don't normally have car , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they've got no commitments and usually not car and all of those things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you're still learning to drive actually , so that just costs more than car , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you're more likely to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so like it is an age group to target , really , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if we're talking twenty five euros as price , that's not unaffordable , even for young people .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , that's what , that's like fifteen pounds ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", many people without t_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is not unaffordable , but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have t_v_ to use its full .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but do they but the t_v_s are often someone's old t_v_ that's blah and be bit strange to have fancy rome remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we didn't have t_v_ last year , and everyone thought we were off our heads , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "common , the students , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the stu , and the remote control might not , it might not even function with the old t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'ve we've got quite decent t_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "bu but even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or we can just , but at the same time we can just decide to have both of these groups as our target , because actually they're all still re young people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the fact that , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , would pay more for voice recognition remote control , does say quite lot really .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that and the disposable income and don't t's something to ignore , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is not massive difference , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five , but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that gonna have an implication for the technical specs ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was having general outlook on most like sophisticated features , but voice recognition itself i'm not very about , because one of the things that cat pointed out was how do we go about implementing it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you do have it in your mobile phone though , don't you ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because you have like every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but how frequently do we use it anyway and ho how good is it , voice recognition softwares are still quite .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with but with t_v_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five , louder , tha that should be relatively simple .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you'd need code word .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so like when you say change , except that's being said quite lot on t_v_ , so like , remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how often do people say remote on t_v_ ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "although only watch charmed , so really wouldn't know but like so you'd just say remote five , remote ten , remote one two nine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it seems like feasible thing to implement for limited .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if you wanna look into that just to check .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if we go for the fifteen to thirty five age group and then we're going to get anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money , then they'll still go for the same advertising .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't think there's lot of voice recognition remote controls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now the voice recognition if it works wonderfully we could possibly do away with all buttons , but this is not really the moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons and , it's safer , so we need both , so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we need both .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what wh what was thinking is that there is this separation between what the channels are on t_v_ and how they are numbered on the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular in the sense that person can say , want to watch i_t_v_ one instead of saying that want to go onto channel number forty five .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would be another way to do it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if something like that can be incorporated , some .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that if that was in the voice recognition , that would be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then the code word would be even more important , because sky advertise on every channel , don't they , so then it would be you'd be watching charmed , and then the sky advert would come on and it would change to sky .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "watch sky and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", and that would be really annoying .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that's definitely possibility .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but on the other hand , remote control isn't as close to you probably might just speak into it and the t_v_ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on remote control though ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that you can yell at it , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", so you have to have the remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it'll just change it ,
