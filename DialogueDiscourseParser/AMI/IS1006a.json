remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm the project manager christa pavlov and let's begin .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make project plan , some discussion and then we talk of the next meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we want to do new remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it has to be original , trendy and user friendly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the important points we have to talk about are it's functional design , it's conceptual design , and desail detailed design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and for that we're going all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so let's try the whiteboard .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so any of you who want to go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for favourite animals .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's gonna be not my favourite one but the one draw .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it's gonna be you'll try to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , that's rabbit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's my favourite one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "rabbit , where is the carrot ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you want to go ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "am not very good at this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "my favourite animal is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you wa is the white .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "human , yay .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's very complex animal and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "characteristics of this animal is dangerous .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you're supposed to , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , it just small cobra , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that worm ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's co quite recognisable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or christa pavlov .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what about you christa ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , whiteboard is working ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's talk about money .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just tr try to who is user interface designer .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "according to the drawings .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "twenty five euro for remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's the price we want to that's the aim for the price for the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we aim to do this profit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'tis big number .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "on the international market .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're to sell two million then .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for production cost of twelve fifty euros maximum .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so any of you have experience in remote controls ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , we have plenty at home .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "my daughter likes remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that so that could be application .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "mainly , and to break .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "remote controls children proof .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so she likes buttons which make click , so it has to click .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so they have to be waterproof ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it has to be wha baby proof but mainly it has to be very robust because even if she's not very tall she's high enough so that when she throw it away it's so it has to be very robust .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause they eat she ate it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have some child lock , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it has to be looking , colourful , because nobody has colourful remote control , they're always black , but this one could be , purple or , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's not practical .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , that's good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's always black or .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but how gonna , just but it's monochrome it's not like otherwise you will never find it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , because you think , why not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "even we can change colours , no ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like the phones and these things we .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like the phones , it could change colours , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "at least for children like one colour and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ch , but without any extremes like not of this size , not too large .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it should be really small and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't you think no , not too much buttons or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not so big like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not too much buttons and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "should it be , these remote controls where they are what they call universal ret remote control so you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television , then it's the remote control for the sound system , or for your refrigerator whatever if it's or if we should have targeted re remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , there's so you t's better if small than bigger .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so colour , robustness , easy to use , size matters , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "colour , size , sh , at least not bigger than this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , not too small , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "at least it should hold in your hand properly , like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like palm sized .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just to hold it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but what would be different from this , from the others ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if , at least the colour would be different .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can change the colours that at least the frame .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so then it depends you are to you can easily remove the frame .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one thing important in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find good button in the place .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for some reason they click the off button when they want to use the so there's problem in the design of that remote control somehow , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , some idea with cellular phone with screen that will tell you what no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , no screens , it's too complex .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "too expensive for twelve euro ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "too expensive , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and not too expensive , t's not my problem , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and too expensive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but no screens on remote controls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it could be only screen which would change depending on the use or even the user .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so ma prefer to have the off button at the top , so would have my own design of the remote control because it's just full touch screen remote control , if you like .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it it's like two types no ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it makes sense , but , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "people are handed or left handed so because am left handed use like this , say if you're handed you use like this or so tha your switch on and off should be on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so adaptable something .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if it's possible , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright , good , so how many actions do we need to implement in it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "even we can keep two switches and then we can only make one working .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if i'm left-hander use this switch to follow the main operations .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it's less than three then we can make it like three mental states , what , we can just make it controlled by brain , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "three buttons you mean ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it's more , if there is software inside that ask you three .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if it if we want universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may need more than three button , three possibilities , ye .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "more than three actions that you may want to do at given time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you do this ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "usually just change channels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because i'm only using three or four channels but and then back to the one was before , so there's whichever it was .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but they keep generally their slash this thing and then the dash and then you can put , you can only have one bit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "change channel like this , want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also we can be here , that would be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "go back button is good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we had that in other countries .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "once had it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the previous button is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "even the history so you could like undo previous of the previous .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then you can watch what your you could also record your sequence of actions , that becomes more complex , but you could look at what the other people have used there or remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what the which channels the viewer marketing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we have full of idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and want you to work on these ideas and try to make the ones , make to decide what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and more in the technical parts what do we want to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so your personal coach will send you some instruction for this thirty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what does m_e_ means ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "m_e_ the user requirements ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or that's for us ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", the user requirement specifications , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll think of that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "see you in thirty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}], "id": "xxxxx", "relations": [{"y": 1, "x":
