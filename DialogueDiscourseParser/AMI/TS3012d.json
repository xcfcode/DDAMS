"speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so which you see the which is de one of the most expensive parts .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , we have sin one curve , design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we had special colour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "suppose yellow is special colour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so just half euro for you have pushbuttons and an display .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have the total of seventeen euros in production cost , which is higher than the twelve and half that we are permitted to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , easy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what do we scrap .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "had the best solution that came up with is just to take out the speech recognition .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'd say that too .", "speaker": "B"},

issue when we started designing this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so ju took that out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so and so it's still stuck with thirteen , so had to take out the special colour

separate covers can account for the if people want it , we'll just then we'll do it in black .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll just deliver it in black , have the it has all the function that it's supposed to have , and if you want it if you want the custom design , then you can buy the separate covers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you make it orange or whatever you want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it was big issue , but i'll just go back .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so can't we just extend it to thirteen ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let's just let's see what , let's just see what we no , we have to be under twelve and half .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it the and the what .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it it's not the project is no-go if we go over twelve and half , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but there's another problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but there's another problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we take another cover , black , then we also need another button frame , 'cause black and black doesn't work .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you that's what you were ass assigned to do really , to see how both those work together .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , it's one of the it's good way to help people to make to keep the product trendy too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just keep you just make new covers for the for it , like we before .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and everything that's left is the basic function that we want our product to have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we need that for the display .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then again , we have the display , which is also expensive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but those go together .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , we could take out the curve .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or say let's lose rubber , take plastic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we could take out curve .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "could we could take out the curve .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that an option ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "although we are demolishing little bit the style .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the colour is more important than the really the curve , because if you just end up with an entirely black remote control so black and grey is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's it does ruin it , but the fact that took that decision or took this example actually , not really decision , but the example is because we do offer the possibility of adding your own custom covers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the people spongy , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you can change any colour you want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's just you deliver basic remote control with possibility to change you into whatever you want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can we then not also change the material ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we take plastic for the basic cover and we can put those to the other covers .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can take plastic , but it's something that's stuck into my mind is that something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the and it really makes it also makes it different from the existing remote controls , because they're all plastic .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and but the people want to pay for it , so why do we have to keep us on the twelve and half ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so which in turn rubber would increase durability because it doesn't break .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but what do you then suggest we'd lose ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because we have to lose two things and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "al like said , lost the speech recognition and lost the special colour , which would make this black and grey .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's enough ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's that that's enough , because those are the basic colours .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which we can fabricate , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "those are basic col they want to ensure the profit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that that's the order .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're just we're the project team and we got our orders from the pro from the boss of our company which say we don't wanna spend more than twelve fifty for this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we can take risk .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that's not for our that's not our decision to take .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , we need to stick to that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have budget of twelve fifty per product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so stick that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't t's really bad either .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we have the backup of or the backup design thing to have they would do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "hope the people will like it , but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they do like because yo we you we agree upon that the cover thing was idea , because you could have all designs while at the same time just manufacturing one product , one basic product which you could turn into any taste you want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect and keep the functionality between of within the boundaries of the your budget .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "perhaps we should make .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the first sheet .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that's they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost , that they know that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "perhaps they decide tha .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is it worth is it does it mean anything to the customer ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but they don't and if we so which curve is that ba that's that curve .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like , it like , we don't care we don't care that you had to true , but we did we didn't get that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "perhaps they no , but perhaps they think , the cover is such idea , let's that then they thow us to make some more costs .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we ca we can at least tell them that you that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's it should either be pack , we sh that should be sold in the in stores with standard cover .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , i'm not talking about that cost but the one that has given us the order to design this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but they could , but it's an option , but , it's true .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could at least make it like this , like you said , and then tell them , we had to drop this and that , just that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it is an still an option , but not for this price .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so actually it's not that much of an increase , but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we cannot contact them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's just the order that we got .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "exactly , but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's what we gotta go with .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's either one just to get it just to get it through final , it's either turned into plastic , drop the squishy feel , make it more breakable , or turn it yellow .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's something we have to decide on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'd say lose the curve and the colour and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "say lose the curve .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's true , we could lose the , forgot that , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's just this one just this is the banana curve .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this would be straight .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we could still have the comfort .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , that would be curve inside the thing , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , would ju then it would just be straight remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which would , turn it into something far more ordinary .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could make it yellow then , but you second that , you second that we lose the curve .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , that it would turn out to be pretty straight-forward remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's not really that would .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it would be good idea to keep the curve to separate it from the rest of the remote control world , so to speak .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we keep the curve .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the only solution is either to use the lose the yellow or lose the rubber .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and i'm in favour of keeping the rubber , because it has more advantages than the colour yellow has .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would say would agree with you on the colour , because that's an extra option , an extra service we can deliver for little bit of more money .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we can always do that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "people are willing to pay for that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can take that option and just with the idea in the back of our head that you can customise your remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that would still make it product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're final on that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's too bad we can't make the whole super thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but anyways we're here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which is what we discussed .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this we discussed just now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's just now just we could just discuss how the project went .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was expected that everything would turn out this way , but because you , everything cannot be for free .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and want to do that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we didn't it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because that was it was really essential really to ma because we spent entire stage designing product of which we had no idea what it would cost .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , we could have hope it sells .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we just put something it's really nor not in stroke with reality actually .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "me too , felt bit blind throughout the project , because in the beginning had no list of available materials , and then had not list of available finances .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would have been .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but let's see let's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "materials would be at least the last meeting would have expected had to have that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so suppose , let's see if it sells .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "suppose this sells , because it's very extended .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but suppose it sells , because it's good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's got everything for the reasonable price , because we didn't it's gonna cost anyway .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's eval evaluate the product of us , our design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have some method , requirements and scale of .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "will pre present some statements and we will decided together wha what if it's true or false and then we see if the requirements of the user are fulfilled or not .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have been met , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and will make new blank sheet .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the buttons , the look and feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it was , but the advanced settings , screen , audio and channel we are not the menu button is it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which are accessible through the menu button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they're stuck under menu .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for the menu .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "those are met , because we really took them for the they have the feel they want , they have the simplicity they want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then it's all it's true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's very met .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "either two or one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we took that everything they wanted into consideration .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it could either be two or one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one and half .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which is not an option .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the , it's red , but look and feel is everybo it's true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just create our own option .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the next one , when it's lost you can find it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "even for deaf people , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's don't t's perfect , but we did everything possible to get it back .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to make it that way , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because if it's stuck in you couch , you can see the light .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can hear it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we tried , so it that's that deserves one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the next one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how is that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we had we don't have an manual , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that's part of it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the display could be little bit more difficult then normal remote control , but then again , it's for young people .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , an , it tells lot about .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'd use an remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , exactly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it's pretty straight-forward , you have navigation no keys to navigate through the menus .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's pretty straight-forward , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , that's true .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it won't be big problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so one no , actu no , it is pretty straight-forward .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's one or .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we didn't even there was no issue on making manual actually .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for the advanced settings .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we didn't really discuss it , but don't takes no , it really does doesn't take time to

"speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we div we did very , ev even if you look at this score , we did quite .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's good product .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "with an screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it just looking for improvements what you could have improved .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if pep people really want speech recognition , then they must be prepared to pu to pay more , because it's cannot be done for this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can make another one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they sh they should get kids , and just stick in t_v_ and say change the channel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but for this price you cannot ask that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you cannot think of that no , it's not .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's just not it it's not affordable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or your sh you should lose the screen probably , but that's the screen is more worth than speech recognition .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's also more attractive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that was that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's the final product without the speakers , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so did you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let's see , what was left in the another one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we evaluate the product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "general project , what's in , thou we were pretty creative in what we created .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we took the whole new approach of making exchangeable cover , which was pretty creative , because it was never ever listed somewhere .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "leadership is up to you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "perhaps screwed up because put speech recognition into it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that's not for me to decide .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we did pretty as team-work though .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because , was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime , because when got the when got the input for the financial results , initially wanted to contact you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you're working separate .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "say , look , this is you're doing the wrong thing , you're wasting your time now , because we're implementing that we cannot afford .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it would be better if there was more communication between because that's what would you what you would normally do , either call or email someone .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "direct communication with .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we could share information which we received .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that was too bad con was impossible here anyways .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's the same thing that had in the beginning .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "everybody was using materials that didn't have .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it didn't have or didn't knew what they costs or whatever .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that was little unclear suppose .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "smartboard is pretty .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "especially for design issues , it's very easy just to give your thoughts little it's easier to share them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my handwriting is little bit .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "although for actual design i'd say the response time should be little bit higher , because the digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to further elaborate on that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's little less it the response time is le it's very bad .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's good to visualise everything , but the response time should could be lot better .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that's , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so can you ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but there's also one problem with this noticed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have to finish page before going to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , you don't have to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , you don't .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "jin didn't check the finish button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can done and then it's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you just ditch it and you can copy it or whatever .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "only if you check the notes or press done .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then it then you can then it exports to word automatically .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it's not necessary to check either one of those two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can just preview your you can just preview your page in the programme .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but made , but made three pages and they were not finished .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and when the third one was finished , wanted to download it and then it was not possible anymore , because you have to close all the pinnits the pages before going further .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "before starting ne new page .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that could be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we cannot work on more than one page at same time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's not possible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have to finish it completely , then download it , it's then start new one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's not very handy , but if that , then it's not problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's , it's understandable , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "any new ideas ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "more communication between that's the thing noticed , that communication is very important , because if you get new information , it's essential for the other team-mates to know that as soon as possible , because you would avoid making doing extra work , because you were doing extra work now working on the speech recognition , you have limitation both on the technical on the design side .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that could have been better .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that's it's more of setting here that you cannot communicate than somewhere else .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "could also possibly be , is it more real-time information base , so we can all see which information is available to one another .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and less spam probably .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm not you got spammed as , but get spammed like every two minutes there was another email about master classes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so which were useless actually .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should probably look into them , but they were all useless .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "personally did not have that , but that's probably your description .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "after five minutes , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but also didn't not really .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but still , you had that as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that we finished up the design and then we checked the website , and then there was just extra information .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there was little delay in the bit of crucial delay .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "didn't have any more information , it's just always the same here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's it would change , but not for me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'd had no extra information to go on that one than what you give me actually .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "couldn't do any research myself or see , that's , could have done little extra work probably , then but was busy enough anyway .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so any new ideas found ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or is that 'cause , it's , probably is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how much time do we have for this anyway ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have no clue .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's like oh,but it should if the project is evaluated and it was in within budget , we should celebrate .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , think that's about it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "bring out the beer .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "want one for my own .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm not what we should still do though let's see wh your tasks were finished , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what you ha from your

being very silent now .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "my personal coach what , name .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we took very little time now , because , we're in agreement , everything the design is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the one thing we missed though , we don't have product name .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , we haven't think above about that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how
