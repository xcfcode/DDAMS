[{"edus": [{"text": "that went , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright , let me just powerpoint this up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "think of it 's turning the abstract into slightly more concrete .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that did not make the roles clear enough , so will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "fair enough , for the input , 's always good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , and gonna go through you , whoever wants to go first is fine by me and we'll collate what we know about what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we'll make some more decisions on basic firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , perfect .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , without further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll go first .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "alright nathan , take it away .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it is nathan ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no nathan's fine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's either nathan or participant two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "mister participant two that is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what i'm gonna have to talk to you about today is component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers , so what i'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "components of remote control , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we've already gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "energy source , our manufacturer offers variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and also there's kinetic energy possibility .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's like the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's one possibility but whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate touch screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we'll have to look into that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the case , we have few options , plastic , rubber or wood .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what thickness are we looking at ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "imagine that we could specify .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , and that would cost us more .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and just little note there , touch screen equals many chips which equals many euro .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one thing that noticed was that most remotes operate on infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you notice when you push button on remote you can't see anything coming out of it but there is light coming out of the remote and the television can detect that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if you were to record if you were to make video recording you could actually see the light .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one thing that might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote , just as fun gimmick .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "course it'd have to be part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is there an option that we can have that off or on so person can select like the idea , it's good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "am that we could do that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", just as fun gimmick .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just to set us apart little bit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we really don't have any way around the t_a_ one eight three five .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "findings , we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'s bit of challenge question .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'d say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really feasible option ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's my concern too .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my personal preference is i'll just throw my cards on the table , we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like the idea of the visible light signalling , that's something to set us apart and was thinking about was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in variety of different case materials to suit different tastes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we're not so confined by one style and say some , say our the one if we just go with one and it doesn't go over then we're in bad situation .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can we do marketing piloting too ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "try to see what kind before we launch can we see how they're received ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's an option , but actually there's i've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing now which actually might even come into play beforehand , it may help us decide for now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "very much nathan .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's perfect , so that makes sense for you to take it from here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , 'cause found some interesting things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you waiting for me ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fascinating , compelling even .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "know , what teaser ain't it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so current market trends .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was looking at what's going on in the remote control market now and what's going on in other design fields , to see what's trendy , what's new , what's happening .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "remote control now everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting they're sick of this boring , normal , functional , that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the challenge is that current trends now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is very organic fruit and vegetable thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now i'm not saying we should have , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but it is possible to use natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean , line thing may be something we can look into .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "different skin options , or if we can't afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface , having the images be specific , like you could choose your menu bullets to be different shape or , not the example would choose , but what to and the feel of the next couple of years is spongy , not something i've come up with though if we can get around to getting piloting , casing option like not like skin , but like holder almost if you could do like , leather options or wood options .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like it , like it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "should have mentioned this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as far as the rubber that we can use we can use rubber as part of the case , it has consistency of those stress balls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "might be an interesting way to go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "slick , slick .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so something to sit on for now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so overall we should stick with what we're finding , everyone's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new perhaps the double curve thing and this rubber option is our best way to go for now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "interface , the interface graphics for the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really non-issue .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like the idea of rubber too because it's tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it doesn't matter .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause so many you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's like , it's ubiquitous isn't it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "taped with duck tape and what have you , you wouldn't have that problem if you used rubber .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "very much so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can have duck tape casing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that goes against the whole fancy something , new line , but worth shot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it could go with the granola crowd .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it could be , it could be , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's what know .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for that sarah .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so yur user interface , is aspects of computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise perceive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "commands and mechanisms , that user uses to control the operator operating system .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "here's series of different remote controls that are out on the market today .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we're definitely trying to get away from this look .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the following are bunch of different interface concepts .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "voice recognition , we actually have some new information from our research design team but i'll get to that in moment .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , and you record your own verbal labels and connect them to the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now our design team , research team , has been able to set up system in which you can teach the remote control voice recognition system to respond to with standard responses .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like you could say good morning remote control and it'll say in sexy female voice , good morning joe .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we already have this for coffee maker line on the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "lot of single people on the re on the remote control research team at the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "very true , very true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "another concept is what apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with l_c_ display like on the ipod which am most of about .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , like modern bit bulky , bit crazy , don't think that's we're necessarily going for .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and some special components , ideas like blocking , having the ability to block channels from your for your children and dedicated buttons for commonly used channels and even ideas like secured or hidden programming but again if we go with touch screen don't think that's big issue .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and this is the big daddy of remote controls here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "again probably not what we're going for so my ideas here and where we're heading is something slightly larger than regular ipod with hard cla plastic casing although some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely very good ideas .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "changeable casings our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it and get used to thinking about buying another one which can add value to our bottom line .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "touch screen interface , possibly having go-to buttons being stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and our voice command system which i've talked little bit about already and the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features that are around so red for power , arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh my toastie maker that got from my bank has jokes when it's ready .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that is about it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wonderful ron , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "lot of good ideas , good facts to have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's what they need , it's like little dongle it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time , just connect it , my kingdom .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , good to know all that , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now we have to come to some decisions , figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have chat about it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "based on what nathan presented as far as the various costs and benefits , what do you think about the touch screen at this point ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be really main cost source then ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "my estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty euro per remote , that's just an estimate though .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to produce each one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you are always the dampers on these projects .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "know and our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you industrial designers .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do we remember ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there was some flexibility with that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there is , it's just , it is question of and how much ca does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can we justify it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "from twelve fifty if we wanna get our fift hundred per cent profit margin that would mean selling it from twenty five .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so from the board , that's true , and that's to be fair the per cent of the market we're not going for mass any , mass sales anyway , we're gonna make we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things , we just couldn't , not for twenty-five euros , so we could probably shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell for thirty , but that's something that we can have finance deal with .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "where do you come up with these numbers ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's just off the top of my head , it is pending further emails .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "though that's what people would pay for , if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote , you're gonna expect it to do something .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it is the new it would be in class of its own .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "say that we provisionally go with the touch screen or wh what was your thought on the matter ron ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm thinking that's definitely good idea and also think that we could probably come up with some cheaper means to go about this production , my team in the on the third floor suggested that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "see if we can cut some corners .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and we can get somewhere else cheaper .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's starting point anyway , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no we could have very simple touch screen , there's always the opportunity , if it's gonna be about the size of the ipod or whatever , we can play around with it bit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright , let's say that so the touch screen will be our main selling point here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that we really have two main selling points , that our casing and the voice recognition to be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house , we've come up with this , with this new voice we're using it for our coffee machines already .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the voice rec thing , if we're looking at bottom line , now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on , we might have to drop the voice rec .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause with voice recognition really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we'd have to decide between definitely .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we've already got it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "pass you on that email from my guy in guy down the hall .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what do you think on it nathan ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "about the voice rec ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we do both the production costs are going to go way up but it does put it into it'd become the rolls royce of remote controls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it would be very .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have to reflect back on what our market research did say .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they said they wanted voice recognition .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "course , they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we t'll sell is call don't think give the highs ups .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like really 't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "does having both really up our costs ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'t see how it wouldn't , there's the old aphorism , you can have it fast , you can have it cheap or you can have it quality , pick two of three .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can't have all three .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's just impossible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're gonna pick betwe alright so we have to pick between one of the two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "otherwise , we just it just becomes cost prohibitive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what which , which do we suspect we should hold we should hold on to ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we already have research backing voice recognition as fiscally solvent .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell that's what we need to go with and we can table this touch screen for our next model .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would have to side with that , the voice recognition is simpler , we already have the all the technology in-house , it's ready to go , it's packaged , it's , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but the voice recognition would they're both gonna push the costs up , but , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition we're not gonna have to do as much design work and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up , if what .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what does the cost look like ron ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it cheaper to do the v_r_ or to do the touch screen ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my is , definitely have to agree with that last comment .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we're still not then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either , we can stick with what we've already got .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in lot other ways too .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so i'm getting alright so more or less you think that of the two of , the voice recognition will be better .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's our lower risk option which for now we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's you and me outside little here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that's you guys's next step ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'ll we'll sic we'll sort out what it what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype but that's our next step , it'll be developing of prototype .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are we going to talk now about the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we'll just run through it , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you discussed either lithium or solar power .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would the solar power be enough to fuel voice recognition ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel voice recognition remote control ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the solar power definitely would be but just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that , we should install small backup battery .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote hasn't been exposed to it's true .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what of people with like the t_v_ in their basement , like what if wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having secondary source is probably .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it works about the same as solar powered calculator , and how those don't really require that much light , but little more light than calculator , but we're not talking about lot of light .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "doesn't have to be out taking sunbath for few hours day or anything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what do you think ron ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm willing to agree with everything that's been said .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have to say though that another idea's come up in my head .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we're really not handling the remote control to extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having hand-held remote control and have round remote control that looks like paperweight like that , sleek little neat thing that sits on your table .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "why , why moving away from hand-held , why ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what's the idea ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you don't need to pick it up it could be selling point .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you think people that are people that buy remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "true , and probabl we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as basic manual too , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have to have buttons on it too as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that's done , that's no bother if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever they might have or like who is it , apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the sub-woofers like clear and glass and then they got these little pyramidal type of speakers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "why not have little rounded thing , it could still have the basic buttons on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with the bu .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and menu button and , use channel button to scroll through the menu if they want to record programmes or whatever we can sort that out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you're on to something because we need to escape the traditional shape of remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "something that looks on table is would be good , even though and hand-held the same time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "way to go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's all about following apple's lead on lot of these things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm thinking of the airport portal , like that little pod looking thing ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "although we do wh is i'm recalling that she mentioned that we need to get away from the surgical white brushed aluminium thing and get back to it but you could have very tasteful wood coloured or earth tone still , along those lines .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would be kinda neat .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like that , like that idea lot .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's see what we can do as far as that goes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the material like the plastics and , we were discussing that being using like rubber softer feel , li lik if you feel the tip on this pen it's bit gives just bit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "something where it's more advanced form of plastic that has some tactile response to it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just the squishy feel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is the next big thing , so that's not gonna hurt us either .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's see if we can do squishy non-remote control-looking remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but to be fair , you just you could just put it literally put it on the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like it , like the idea , that's good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we've sorted of discussed costs , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll that's gonna be thing , if we run bit over-budget , that might be , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "about the lack of information on cost , haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers and i'm just having to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we'll have more of an idea when the prototype have more of we'll have more of an idea later on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we just go from there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out , so we're more or less con we wh we're more or less in agreement that we want to have simple function , not too complex .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on daily basis , although i'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , like those shouldn't be take precedence , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like have menu things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if , if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can just incorporate something that folds out like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here and something that slides down to reveal the more complicated things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and they slide .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and do we wanna consider like an ipod screen which isn't touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options , in true , we're still not making it easier then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "think then we're hitting our cost issue again .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we've also got the me the thing of , if we're gonna have non-remote-looking remote , how do we .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but no we could do slide or compartment , like if it say it's lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have compartment in there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or , series of three or four buttons with menu button and then side an up and down type of thing , like on d_v_d_ player .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you see the modern d_v_d_ players'll just have menu button on the side and then four buttons around them and you can just manoeuvre through the menu like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's just scroll .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so are we gonna are we talking we need to figure out what buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "seems like it seems to me that we could just do the stick with the rubber 'cause

of the buttons and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no it's basic just like four directions that are that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it , are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy new for .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we've already covered this as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that seems to be selling and
