function design phase will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and i'll be doing research to figure this out .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in the conceptual design phase will be dealing with trend watching and i'll be doing marketing research on the web .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then finally in the detailed design phase will be doing product evaluation and so will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "hiya , i'm ryan .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm the user interface designer .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "likewise i've three different roles for each stage of design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in the concept design , the user interface , how the user reacts with the product .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the detailed design like the user interface design , what they might be looking for , things like fashions , what makes wha how we're gonna make it special .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's about it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm manuel and i'm the industrial designer in this project .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in the functional design phase i'm i'll be dealing mostly with the requirements , we'll discuss what the prog what functions the product has to fulfil and so on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "suppose we'll work together on that one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in the conceptual design i'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials of our product .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the detailed design in the detailed design i'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself , so we're working together on the design front here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we've got our opening , our agenda is the opening , acquaintance which we've kinda done .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "tool training , project plan discussion and then closing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "grand total of twenty five minutes we have here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we are putting together new remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we want it to be something original .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're not only electronics company but fashion conscious electronics company , so we want it to be trendy and we want it to be easy to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design which is the three of you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and functional design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do we have any ideas of let's just throw out some ideas of what remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and how we're gonna do the detailing on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "function of remote control is just , change channels is its main function .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we want it to be t_v_ remote or do we want it to do other things besides just be television remote ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "suppose you try make it universal remote for could work on all electrical products in one person's house .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they all work on the same prin principle as sorta like don't actually know .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but is it just infra-red ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is that standard ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", universal remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is my first go-round with creating remote control , so we're all in the same boat here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one thing of with the remote control is you always lose .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if there's way of finding it quite easily , that'd be quite good feature .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ch like tracking device ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we should set our remote control up to where it has like tracking device or like it makes noise , there's button on the t_v_ that you press and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can get those key you could whistle or make noise and it'd beep .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "generally , all remotes are quite similar in their appearance .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do we want so they're kinda like long and rectangular .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do we want something crazy ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we want something new that's gonna stand out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "lot more modern .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "modern so our remote should be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like user-friendly , like little , where you can use both hands , like little keyboard type thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "people , because people always tend to throw remote control about the place to one another if it was in ball , and the actual controls are inside .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are certain restrictions , you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time , so there are always the some restrictions we have to apply here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "however one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , that refers to the material , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what are we gonna build that thing out of ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how sturdy is it gonna be ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do we want it to last longer or rather have people whatever , have to buy one every half year ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , so we want it to be sturdy , we want it to hold up to somebody's child , throwing it across the room or , as you said , people kinda throw it , so ball-shaped , if it were ball-shaped , then it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it could be cased on the outside and everything could be inside .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy , so our form and our function .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we want it to be easy to find .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what else it what else do we want it to do ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we want it to be universal .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five euros and , goals for profits are somewhere around fifty million euros , what they wanna make on it , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also since we're partners of the international remote control association , we wanna make it something that would globally appeal .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's more on the research end , but the marketing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so marketing , how marketing , you could find out what is the most universally appealing remote control out there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and as far as design goes , we could have different ones for different target audiences , 'cause one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you have any ideas for what it should look like ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could draw it up on the board over there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we want it to be ball , we'll draw up we'll draw up the ball and where the buttons are located .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'd could draw sorta the ball idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "my original idea was just simply sphere , where you this is where it's connected together , and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be flip , like flip phone , and then when you fold it out the middle hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if that if we did use hinge , or if it was just two parts , and then you'd have just sorta you , your buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "thing is inside , sometimes remotes have too many buttons , so as simple as possible , as few buttons inside as possible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", what's the idea for .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just something if you ha if it had like if some like light or lights around it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's looking bit like something out of star wars at the moment though , to be fair .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that was sorta simple idea had and then you could about , it would almost be like ball .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that was just an idea had .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "whether anybody else has other ideas ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one problem you'd get with this design is the ball is idea because of it's stability really , but , since it's ball , it'll roll , so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere , take away that part .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's one of the big issues .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's good idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also you risk the hinges here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the idea it didn't have to necessarily be hinge , that was just one idea though .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's interesting , but that's weak point , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how would we go about making getting rid of our weak points ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what would we just have flat spot on the bottom of the ball ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not to put you on the spot , but what did you say your title was again ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm your industrial designer , so , the point is that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you're the industrial designer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the shape is perhaps not the most ideal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as stable as it is , there must be compromise between stability and design here , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "suppose that things become design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but was trying to think of like the design of others .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'t think of anything other than long rectangle for remote , small , fatter ones , but there's nothing being done out of left field , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's not new , it's not innovative , it's , everybody does long remote because it's easy , it's stable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll draw something .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if no , go ahead .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my idea was just to have it be like keyboard type shape , like video games so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that would be kinda big and bulky .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could also try to do the hinge thing , so it could like flip out that way .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's my idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "definitely doing something different is good idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "design something , that's like suppose not everybody's hand's the same , but something that would fit in the hand easier .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "something with grip .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because even suppose even with the ball it's it might not be the easiest to hold onto .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it still might be hard to it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so perhaps the joystick the keyboard idea might work better .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then again , people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda , so we feel like i'm just shooting everything down here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's definitely got to be one-handed job .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you're the boss , you're allowed to .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "with the one-handed design you also have the problem of the size 'cause from cell phones , they can be too small .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if the remote is too small it if it's small it probably looks better , but may not be as functional .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so for that there's so the question is also , do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so unfortunately we've got about five minutes here to come up with our remote control idea and start rolling with it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've talked about our experiences with remote control and we've got couple ideas .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's see here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what if we had what if we had not only say we went with the ball function , but we give it grips along the side to make it easier to hold on to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's easier to hold onto that way .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "course that'll then remove some of our ball .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "unless this part were raised , so say the cover flips over and covers that part .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the grip is no , that wouldn't work either .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sorta grips on the side here , and then flat and then we have the problem with the hinge .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if we're flat on the bottom , it's not gonna roll away , it'll stay where we want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway , so if lid is good idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "from stabil stability point of view it certainly is , but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident , the more we sell .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's don't make it too stable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we don't have it flip open .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we just have ball , so then we forget the ball .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then to go back to the to something along those things then .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to the other design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it looks , but it's really not it's not functional .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we've got our keyboard kind .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what if we flipped it around here , so that it were , that doesn't look anything like what you had there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's up and down , you hold it this way .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "course then it's like the rectangular again , only with couple of jutting out points .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it's one-handed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "question is what makes those game pads functional ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the form for full hand .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's round shape underneath that makes it comfy , makes it , so that's the essential part .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "except for that we'll not probably not get away from some longer design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because it doesn't have cord , like joysticks do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "all that dif batteries , and batteries go weak as , so after while you have to point it towards the equipment you wanna control with it , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , have to show which is the front , which is the back .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it possible to have it to where it would work with like sensor on either side ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that either way you're pointing it would work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "suppose you could do that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the more technology you stick in that , the more it'll cost , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "more expensive and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "course you can do that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it'll be evident after while or if you look at it , it'll be evident which way around to point it , since you have the numbers and the buttons and , but it's rather about an instinctual thing , like you just grab it , you don't have to look at it , which way around to point it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "put it even if you designed it in some in way that , isn't rectangle , but still pointed in direction that had definite points .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "otherwise the design of or the point of putting two sensors on both sides would probably work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if that's your thing and you got something like that instead , and there's your you kn which way you're gonna pointing it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to interrupt , but we have warning to finish .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "does it say what does it say for it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "are we out of time ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", just to finish up , should we go with this plan , start making some are good ideas , what are not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "must finish now , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then marketing will look and see what people want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and project manager will design better meeting for next time around , be little bit more prepared .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and alright , good meeting .", "speaker": "A"}], "id":
