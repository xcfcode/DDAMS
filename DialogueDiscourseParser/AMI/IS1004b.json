[{"edus": [{"text": "everybody is ready ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "good morning again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , today we are going to have second meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "michael , hi .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have good reason for that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's have look to the agenda today .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , we are going to have meeting about the functional design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so first before starting just going to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we are not decided if we should go for universal or specific remote control , but have new inputs for about that topics .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "goin i'm going to share with you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we decided to go to individual actions for each of you so industrial designer should wor was supposed to work on the working design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you showed us you ar you prepare something for us ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the u_i_ guy also work on that , and for the mar our marketing expert should deliver some specs .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but first would like quickly to decide of to give name to the project .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , put quickly remo , but if you have any other names that we co could decide for just to keep something fun for our project we should we could discuss quickly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "spanish name would work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was thinking of the mando .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "especially if we're selling into the u_s_ market becasue there's lot of spanish speakers there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "something that sounds in english but sounds funny in spanish .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what is that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it doesn't sound for me , but for spanish for control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what does it mean ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what does it mean in spanish ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause it also like in english it sounds like the man's tool because men like to have control of the remote so it might the mando .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "mando sounds latino .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , let's go for mando ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we could have some like you could have the fonts special , so you have man in like in one font and then the o_ as like although you don't wanna cut women out of the potential buyers though , do you ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , this is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they are the most t_v_ watcher .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we should be careful .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is more question of this is more question of look and feel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it because if the product will be international should start .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "something that should be addressed later .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we should go to other for the other topics .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's the thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we need to know who we're selling it to before we can really decide on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so let's stick to man mando for the name and we'll see for the look and feel later .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so let's go for the three presentations now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , who want to start ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we could start with the market , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so have your slides somewhere ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should be in participant four .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so will give brief outline about what prepared for this meeting .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for the functional requirements and especially for the user requirements .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "prepare marketing report and we have to find the weaknesses and the improvements we could do to the current remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and also di did study with for the incorporation of new technologies it seems that the remote controls have been have remained the same for the last five , ten years .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there is no significant difference between the first new controls and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "sh next slide ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "more most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so and they admit that the they should they would spend more money in fancier remote control , which is good and it's interesting point .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "also the people are worried about the r_s_i_ disease , which is if you repeat the sa the same movement , which is not with not very appropriate device , you will have problems whe when you will get old .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so people are worried about the shape of the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they are also they get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often , so it would be good point to find solution to any beep any alarm incorporated to with the remote control every time it get lost .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and also found that young people the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so in my opinion the mando this mando shouldn't be very small because the smaller it is , the more like the liklier it is to get lost .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "liklier or more likely ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "people also complain because they all have the same size of the buttons for buttons who which are not very use like memorising channels or this actions which are not very often but they shouldn't have the same importance in the remote cont in the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "also the design should fit the hand shape .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it may be interesting to in both prototypes , for and left handed people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the on the thing is though , most remote controls are used by more than one person .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so unless you're targeting single people you're gonna cut out some lot of your market .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "anyway it could be int interesting to release some small fraction of this remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it could be universal design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "universal design , which is good for both the hands .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "still shaped for your hand but not for particular hand , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "whether it's left hand or hand , but don't you think that the two points are clashing , one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the first and the third point , they are clashing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can still be , you can still extend past the hand .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like , like no was thinking of so like something .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so fitting the hand doesn't mean much then .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "means like , this remote here is very thin and long so instead of having you might have it bit bigger or , with some finger molds .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it means design should be similar to the traditional ones ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "little sleek , longer ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it should fit the hand .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "something with the shape of the palm ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "some finger grips .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you could even have some buttons like on the sides and everything , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "on the sides .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it sh it shouldn't be symmetric symmetrical .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then finally .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and finally , the incorporation of or speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting , but if the budget would be large enough .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "first i'm just wondering about the because , so it's good time for me to bring you to some new informations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but most of the young people to thirty years old were really interested in this technology .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we had the new requirements from the so from the head offices of the company , and so they wanted so they want to they would like to be restricted to t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you had this information already .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , so they want us to restrict the remote control to t_v_ only because of time limitations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they want also excellent .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually this marketing report is restricted to t_v_ remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because ll te teletext is outdated now and finally , it should be clear that the corporate image , that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was still working on this twenty five euro price point because actually having looked at some of the remotes out there , this is quite low price if we're get to this in my presentation though , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we can jump to your presentations , now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so let's keep in mind about tha that this last point about and speech reco , what is your ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "even if it was within budget do speech reco rec system it might be bit difficult because if you you're watching t_v_ you're gonna have lot of this background noise from the t_v_ which might interfere with the participant three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you might have some background noise from the t_v_ which will make the speech recognition much harder , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you should be able to activate or disactivate , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you press button to talk , and the t_v_ sound turns off .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no it could be command control thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "means you say you should say like does that , remote control being on or be on thing , and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because this thing means speech is there from the t_v_ also .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so there should be something command controlled , you start and then you stop .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's like v_i_ editor , you are having two modes similarly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "otherwise it's just lying idle .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , could describe the mouse be easier to could use the mouse , or .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the wheel doesn't work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so while researching this topic first of all just thought of couple of things that would like to see in remote , and just looked to see if they're actually available in any current remotes , and then also searched for which are the top-rated remote controls on epinions dot com , which is customer written review site .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so there's pretty wide range of remote controls these days and this remote control on the here is one of the more extravagant , but it's not really it's by no means on it's own in being so expensive .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there are lot of expensive remote controls out there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "looks like p_d_a_ ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it doe it's all the functions are controlled through the screen except for the really main functions , which have couple of their own buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if you look at lot of the universal remotes out on the market , know we're working on television remote , but lot of the universal remotes out there have these screens which helps when you're using multiple devices suppose because you can have multiple functions different functions on the screen at different times .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the thing that find most interesting about this remote control , and it's difficult to see in the slide , but it has scroll wheel on it , which is like mouse scroll wheel , which is it's really important design aspect is it's 'cause the thing is what we the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the simplest thing that remote control does is it just change the channel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "change the channels .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now the that scroll wheel is actually pretty handy way of changing the channel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause know when use the remote to change the channel very rarely use the numbers on the pad .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "usually use the up and down because most channels are two digit numbers and you have to press special button to enter two-digit number , and then two numbers , so that's just it's annoying .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so scroll wheel is quite handy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now the scroll wheel is much more useful if you have an screen , and this brings us to the point you were mentioning before about the internet capability .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one possibility , if we now we need to still talk about the price point because lot of this can't be done for twenty five eu euro , but one possibility is to download program information into the screen so that instead of actually saying want to go to channel thirty seven because know this programme's on , often you what ch what channel it's on , or you what's on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you have list of programs on your screen you just scroll to that program rather than to channel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if you think about it's like in mobile phones now you don't use you don't remember people's phone number , you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this would be pretty handy thing to have , but we really need to discuss the price .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , there are cheaper this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's very simple , there's only few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in different context .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is something else we might wanna consider , is really limiting the number of buttons , because this is the top rating universal remote control on epinions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it it's really worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as possible because really people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and was saying before about having different size buttons for different frequently used tasks , but also the location and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if you have too many buttons it increases the difficulty of finding the one you want .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but there is one problem then the user has to understand each of that functionality .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we will have bit of simpler task in that we're only doing television remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because the same button is doing too many things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one option is to have little flip-open door that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would if had my perfect remote control , i'd probably just have no numbers on it because they're just in the way .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they don't really do anything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "although do also find flip-open doors bit of pain because sometimes they can break off or whatever , but door that you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but definitely you need to keep the buttons down to minimum , but not let that interfere with the functionality of the device .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that depends on how you market it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that the tr the transition to this new remote control shouldn't be very abrupt very hard because if people see remo see the see remote control without numbers they will t's very difficult to learn very difficult to very different build very different to the traditional if i'm if you can sell speech recognition remote control for twenty five euros everyo everyone will buy it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it does sampling out of the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you have the advertisement showing how easy it is and how you can , navigate to program without the numbers , then people might say that looks pretty easy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can you continue , mi ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , one of the really useful things you can do with internet connectivity would be to have this programme driven interface rather than the channel number .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if we can have higher priced remote control that would really be worth something that would be worth implementing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's the screen , which is too expensive , but also at the scroll wheel , haven't mentioned it here , the scroll wheel could be used without an screen , just for changing channel numbers easily .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "even that , that would be fairly cheap thing , compared to an screen , to implement , but that would be quite useful as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the other thing , you say we need to we need to keep it just television , but one option , since this is supposed to be fashionable device , is there's certain or factor that you can have with technology , and we wanna make it something that's extensible to do other tasks .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "say you have like little another little base unit that can also receive signals as the television where you can , say , change the lighting in the room .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would be something you could sell as an extra , so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development , but , later on you could you can you also , selling the potential of the device .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then you say potentially you can then do other like change the lights , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on , and , that's something we may need to have as at least as an optional extra to kinda make our product , since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you want to go ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition , that means on my own , it should be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , not that one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you are two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the working design is user interface could be of two types , one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this , and on top of that there could be speech recognition technology also being sitting on the remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the old users who don't want to have any changes , it can be useful for them , and the new users , as our marketing expert was saying , they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to interrupt you , but we have seen before that there is new way of interacting that use wheel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so anyway , that didn't come into my mind , so that is possibility .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "these could be other interfaces .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "means we can have , depending on the cost , how much we can afford , we can have different interfaces .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so spe buttons are something which is very everybody is familiar with .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people it is , and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty-five euros money which we are thinking .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "otherwise we are just like others in the market .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so anyway that is the first , user interface could be of more than one type , and that means we can do the on-line changes which cannot be done now actually .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so apart from the speech , we can have the scroll thing with the buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now for buttons , normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require microphone also to be sitting there on the remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that increases the cost also .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but means we have to see how much what microphones and like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you think that performance of such systems are enough to target of such technologies is enough ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wh imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance an ambience microphones because you are not going to speak into the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no it could be little it could be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it could be few centimetres .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one other thing that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is when you want to sell into other markets , though , because , i'm not exactly where we're gonna sell this , but presume it's not gonna just be english speaking countries .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so then you have to , you have to train models for .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's more like , means there are different speech technologies which are existing so d_t_w_ could be which is the easiest .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you have to store some templates on the chip itself , and it's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is , instead of having model which has to be trained and being micro-controller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we shou we should discuss this la later after this slide .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is very important issue in discussion .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , will you go to the next slide ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is the design which we are thinking so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we are having power button and the switch , which is not much , and then we are having the which is to indicate whether the power is on or not .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then there are two things which can be so one is the button interface which has not been shown because of lack of time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we could not put that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so now where the a_s_r_ decoder is sitting , similarly there are different interfaces which could be there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so there is a_s_r_ decoder which could be there , and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller , and then there could be buttons , and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then there is the chip which is sitting , the green one , and it converts it into bit codes , and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is the easiest design the there could be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so an a_s_r_ decoder we can have things in .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to have different technologies .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this was the my personal preference was that we can have a_s_r_ sitting there on the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you could actually train the remote control as you're using it by saying turn volume up , and you press the button like people teach sign language to kids , by speaking and doing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but as soon as you try to put the microchip thing the price will go up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so these are the slight problems .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because the reason is that if we go into the market means though don't have much idea , but as he the marketing expert presentation was so if we go with just the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "actually i'm not so because i'm the if was using remote control to , say , turn the volume up because 't hear it very , don't really want to drown out what people are saying by talking when i'm instead of pressing up on remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if there's some dialogue all of sudden that 't hear , i'm trying to actually find out what's being said , so speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so gentlemens , we have to take some deci decisions now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the average frequency of pushing buttons , it's about eighty pushes per hour , like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "depends if it's remote control if the remote control is something that you don't actually have to pick up anymore , that would be useful feature of the speech recogntion .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it , then that could be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if summarise everything we've de we said .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we are targeting t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we need to have remote control which is fanc fancy , which is easy to hand not too small , not too big .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have or good shape , yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with good shape for the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we should bring new technologies for young peoples , and as we have also requirements to use to push thr toward the internet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is something we can stick to it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and also , very interesting things i've seen on the one of the comp our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an target price , it's not possible to go to and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first why not to go to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because as we are targeting t_v_ we can use t_v_ screen as screen to feedback to give some feedback informations about what we could have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "depends though depends .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we don't unless we have some input some video input to the t_v_ or we have control over the t_v_ then we can't actually display that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like if we produce the t_v_s then we can put menus up there , but otherwise we need to actually have some something sitting in between the video signal and the t_v_ to superimpose those menus .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's an extra cost .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don don't you ha don't we have contacts with people on t_v_ or systems that exist that we can use ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is another que we still haven't really defined the remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "are we still you say we're focusing on t_v_ , but is it still like universal remote in that it's replacement remote control , or is this something for our own line of televisions ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause that really makes big difference .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause even if we have contacts we can't really produce remote control that can bring up menus on other companies' t_v_s .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's just there are too many t_v_s out there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's not really gonna for twenty five euro ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's good point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what's what cou what could be the cost of , could we fit the targets in terms of cost if we go to on the remote control ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not possible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , it would be good to there is any leverage in that any leeway in that twenty five euro because for twenty five euro all we can really do is provide very basic remote control , and that seems to be against the philosophy of our company which is putting the fashion into electronics .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so would like to there's any chance of increasing the of increasing the unit price .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what would be wha but what would be one question , what would be the goal of putting an in remote control ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you mean yo you mean we should target something which is which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to in terms to had to have really an added value ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so regarding the automatic speech recognition , this is they have tele teletext .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers , like an interactive programme guide .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but mo most of the t_v_s nowadays show the but most of the t_v_s have teletext nowadays .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because they have teletext on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have teletext sin signal that you can that you can that you can get thr through the channel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they have most of them have teletext , but we want to get rid one of our requirements is to move to teletext to the use of internet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so to browse more easily the teletext .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can get lot more information on it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "through your remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what would appear in the ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you could have the name of the programme , you could have the start time where it's up to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the ti the start time , all the programmes you could have if this information is available from teletext , also .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you could have even little image of the main actors so you can quickly just even without reading no , but there are the electronic programme guides out there .", "speaker": "B"},
