let's see .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first will introduce myself .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if everybody knows me , so i'm bart , hello .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my name's frank .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's start off with little presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now first i'll tell you little bit about the setting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can see there are few cameras here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they'll record our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there are also some microphones there but you don't have to pay lot of attention on those , because it will disappear when you don't attend to it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so is there project documents folder ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there are some notes in it already see , some documents .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll start with the presentation kick off .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is being modified by the administrator .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's do it read only .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you've noticed , but we're working for real reaction .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's company in electronics .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we put fashion in electronics , we make it work , we put lot of effort in design and in the product itself .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm bart the project manager so i'll direct you through the project .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is our agenda .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have our opening acquaintance , tool training , project plan description closing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "sit down , then take some notes or let's see .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can take the minutes once in while .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not lot of work , but just if you hear something you can write down , just write it down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as you can see it's the opening , aquaintance tool training .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "aquaintance is point we've done bit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have you all seen the corporate website already ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have you seen any flaws in it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can't say paid much attention to it , but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "see if it works this way .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , it doesn't work here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but on the corporate information side there's there was real remote instead of real reaction .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "real remote is not really the company we're we are , but it's just little fault .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what are we going to do ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our project aim is as you can see new remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it has to be original , trendy , and user friendly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so these are the points why we also hired you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've got the marketing expert for the trendy and user friendly look .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and industrial designer there's also user friendly and bit original .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we've got our user interface designer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "he's also that's about the new remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "project method is there are three phases we are going through .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first is functional des design , individual work , meetings .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "after the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "had some role indications on here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it already by yourself .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the industrial designer is going to work on the working design , components design and bit of the look and feel design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the user interface designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the marketing expert is doing little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project product ev evaluation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's bit what you're going to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that will be all worked out in other meetings .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we've got our first tool training .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we are going to work with lot of high-tech tools here , so it's ab it's handy if we have little bit of training first .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in the white board here there's little tool bar on this side .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here are some functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can save .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "these functions we don't have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo little piece of drawing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "blank new document for each person .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "select pen , eraser .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "capture we don't have to do anything with .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we've got our pen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's really funny because you can draw with it on this page in the is form of .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can also select the current colour and the line width .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then first you have to select the pen function .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we're going to work with it in minute .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's very simple and it's easy to draw your findings and drawings on there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then short thing about documents .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've got our shared folder , project what was it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but all you will found that already because there are lot of documents in it already , so it will be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and these are available on the smart boards as , so if you have document you wanna show , just open it from the folder .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here is simple tool bar .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's what said , it's save , print , move back or forward one page .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can switch between the different drawings .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we're going to try out the white board .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so as you can see we all going to draw animal .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just to get bit familiar with it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "mouse wasn't running away .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that was interesting .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is everybody is anybody playing with the mouse ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're going to draw animal .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and just sum up few of its favourite characteristics .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the only thing we have to look after is that we use different colours , and different line width .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's start from now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can use this pen by holding it like little child .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing won't get good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "another thing is you have to be bit slow .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause if you're going to draw like really fast then the pen won't hold up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we choose form of current colour grey is appropriate .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then the line width .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "seven will be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now you'll see my drawing capabilities .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "these are not very much , but , see you have to do it real slow .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was trying to draw dolphin , but his nose has to be little bit but it's close .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm thinking about swordfish .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what it's this is bit of the swordfish .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "he hasn't got an eye .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now we've got another function .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've got the eraser .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then you can undo this easily .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and i've got to write down few of its characteristics .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is they've got no text tool , no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is typically undo action , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have to hold it bit upside-down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be stripe .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , i'm just trying .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is not my work , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's it wants to draw another animal ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it lives for the fun .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's my characteristic about the dolphin .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it lives for the fun .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so now i'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "gonna use different line width .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and i'm gonna draw in black .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm not much of an artist , but here we go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's easier to draw the smaller line width , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because this is going lot better than did .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is my .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "with little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's real dead sheep , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for recognition , see .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can also write your name somewhere .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they are come on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you have to go really slow when you're writing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they're brilliant animal animals .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that's just little me thingy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll pass the pen to our user interface designer .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm just gonna draw its head , but let's see .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what that is ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you say blank , or .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just blank sheet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was gonna draw cat too , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll just try something else .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "something different than garfield .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "mine is bit more skinny .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's pretty skinny cat .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , it's supposed to be cat .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the most interesting tail .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is your cat , or did you find him on the street ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like cats because they are independent .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's pretty clear .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so everybody knows how to work with the white board now ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board , just ask and go ahead .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's pretty easy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "haunted white board .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're being haunted .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we've got the tool introduction .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we move along to the project finance .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as you can see , we for our remote control , selling price is twenty five euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our selling price .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our profit aim is fifty million euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's the least we have to get from our remote controls , so we have to work together to reach our aims .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can do it international , so we have to focus on different users , different cultures , and different trends as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that's all in the later stadium .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our production cost can be maximal twelve and half euros , so that's also point we have to keep in mind , that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside , and like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it won't work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so just try to remember these points .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million , but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and production cost maximal twelve and half euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's leads us to our little discussion .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'm gonna sit down , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you got message .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i've got message .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "five minutes , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's good timing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so just on side note , why is it my laptop is only giving me black screen ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you have to say the magic word .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does it do anything ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have to just clap it down ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "back up again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no slide show .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's off now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now you have to put it back .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you'll be , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it was on , but , there we are .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "t's those laptops .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but so does everybody has experiences with remote controls , and not the ordinary mote controls , but also little bit different ones ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like you can use for other ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have broad t_v_ at home , and d_v_d_ player , so we got like lot of remote controls , one for the t_v_ , one for the video recorder , one for the d_v_d_ player .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , me neither .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i've got one at home .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you can program eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it also operates on infra-red , so you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or second floor .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's pretty handy when you have video recorder or d_v_d_ player downstairs and you've got link to your t_v_ on the second floor .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's pretty handy thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but only the that if you can put different devices in one remote control , it makes it lot easier as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's that's good to remember .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you can take minutes again .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "since it's your job .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we've we want different functions and we can see if we can do something with the infra-red .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if that will exceed the production costs .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that that's something we have to find out , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that would be really good if we could do that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and other functions for remote control ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can make it shock proof .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "has to be shock proof 'cause my remote control tends to fall lot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "waterproof , or , you never no know , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , one other little thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so these are our few things we can think of .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "will put the minutes from this meeting in our project folder .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "thought it might be handy to put battery status display on it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you can see how much is left in the battery .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's battery stays .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but they'll also really drag up the production costs , so think we'll have to see about that too .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but just little led , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's an idea as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they were all mentioned , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "any questions about this presentation ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "kick off presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "nope , don't .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then i'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder , and then we can all work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "finish meeting now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we can all work on our own projects .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then i'll meet you in about half an hour , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "half an hour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so good luck .", "speaker": "A"}], "id": "xxxxx", "relations": [{"y": 1, "x": 0, "type": "Explanation"}]}]
