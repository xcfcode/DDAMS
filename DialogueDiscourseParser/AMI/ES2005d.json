rating we will give to this product and everything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what methodology will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then trends , whether it is as fashion

we have the marker for the board ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there it is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "first of all comes user requirement .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "will first would like to have your views , what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it had all the basic buttons that they needed as the new technology that people said they wanted .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what do you think you will personally give .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "when the user requirement is essentially just to operate the t_v_ , so , we haven't actually got working model yet .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "does it work ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would say seven .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "seven is good , isn't it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'t true or false ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no tr one is true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one is means highest ranking , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but highest ranking is seven , or one ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no it's like true is one end , and false is the oth , i'll go for one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no that's false .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's one for from your point of view .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and what do you say our industrial expert ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's hard to know .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "give it two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can tell on the like she has given her views on the basis of design , because she was our interface expert .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you can give your views based on technology , whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it might even exceed it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but there is shortage of buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm gonna give it two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and what about you , brian ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you will go for one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "basic requirements but of the pro of the project .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for me personally it is everything fine , it may be having good design , it may be meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology-wise , price-wise , but there is one thing which limits the customers , like we are having only two , three designs , like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange , and , lower end .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "come on that was the tha .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the third one is what you ge that is not fruit look .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if person doesn't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , don't buy our product , because we are we like this only .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we are showing our preference for particular fruits , two or three kinds rather , and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that no is that not trends ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , personally as marketing expert don't believe that , because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give range of products , range of shapes , like if we see , look at the smallest thing , toffee chocolates , they give variety of different things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "some children like to buy banana shape , some apple shape , some even pineapple shape , some orange shape .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can what shape person will like .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and by limiting them , we are limiting our sales , limiting our profit also .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but in electronics , it's not always quite so you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", if you're going to buy t_v_ company'll have that you're going to choose from , company'll have two or three choices , but they're different designs .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we were coming up with one product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but will personally won't give it beyond three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , your opinion , i'm just trying to .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we can , on an average we can think three , four sevenths , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "he's tough cookie .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "three or four ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , it should be no , we are doing very wrong thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "five or six .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what are we doing ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what are we doing ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "adding them up ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're gonna average them ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", we are taking everything , and that's have taken it very wrongly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so seven fourths .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "three four two six seven sev one pe exactly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "about one point eight .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can say one or two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because it is one point eight two , so we will do two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "round it up to two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so where were the trends .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can you explain what you want us to write there ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how it how conforms to the current trends ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "again the fashion trends , this also like whether it will be fashionable to have these products in the as fruit shape .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "going on the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , would give it , because it's hard to make fruit good to look at , that looks , so would actually give it three .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "tha three or four , i'm not .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "go for three .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as far as the technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology , but it's missing the screen , as we said , but it does have the push-buttons , or the scroll-buttons , but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the vibrating energy mechanism .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so give it four .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'd give it kinda middle of the road for technology .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "am pret just the fruit does me in , it might be trendy to some , but i'm just not swallowing the fruit , so also would have liked to have seen the screen in it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i'd say about four as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "personally wi that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , like , these products are in fruit shape , because that wha people now our fashion trend shows that people like everything all everything that is being advertised , like clothes , shoes , and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables , or getting them or showing some association with them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so and in this way our product is good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the second thing , now people don't want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that is also ef that also our product meets the fashion trends of the market .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it is cus spongy also .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so they can play with it , it's quite good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so then , give it two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so four five ten thirteen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we can is it fine ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what about company strategy ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the company strategy , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there was lot of discussing , that was good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "feel got my say .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so i'd give the company strategy two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's the remote control conforms to the company strategy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that the question ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so one or two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just leave it , it's fine .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll go with two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what about you , brian ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "kept to the company strategy , so would go for one , as we not only kept it , but we were limited by , groovy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and me also , like , this product me this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers' requirement , as per latest technology , and it should be environmental safe .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so since our product meets all these requirements , so would also prefer to give it rank one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so four six half .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so one and half .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can say two or one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "overall we are getting two something , but we can round it as two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so overall evaluation of our product is quite good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we can launch it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in which case we are done .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause we've
