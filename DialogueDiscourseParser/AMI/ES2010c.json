[{"edus": [{"text": "hope you had good lunch .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're back for the conceptual design meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's get started .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here is the agenda for today's meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes as project manager .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we have forty minutes again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and just to reiterate after this meeting the team will reach decision on the concepts of the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's go ahead and start off with your presentations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "who would like to go first ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just trying to move mine now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "courtney would you mind starting us off ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so trend watching .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "since we do put the fashion in electronics , it is important how our product looks .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we can go ahead and go to the next .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what they want .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now customers want fancy versus functional .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "about fifty eight percent of what they like of the product that they want , describing like the in order of how much they want , fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like , fancy versus functional , and then it has to also be technologically innovative , and yet easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the customer is confused .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they exactly what they want .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they want us to tell them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they want everything , but simply .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we can go to next .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so in milan and paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing , shoes and furniture are just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if we want to go with that and also the spongy feel is in contrast to last year .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "really , the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to rather than like hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and , you'd want like softer touch .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "address some of that issue , with my presentation .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but as for the fruits and vegetable patterns , if we really want to go with that , because it is just trend , and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just few months , because .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "people don't buy new remote every so often .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that could just be spring thing now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so design preferences , we need easy to read like large buttons , clearly labelled so that , 'cause we talked about that being problem .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then also buttons illuminating upon touch , you said that in your design , with the bulb .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that could also tie in with the colour scheme .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we need the real reaction logo and colour scheme .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's one of our key goals , we wanna promote our product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and was thinking about different types of designs and came up with something .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone like this , where we put the buttons around , like we'd put big on-off button else in the middle , it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down , and then put the numbers around in like an old-fashioned dial shape .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause then it'll appeal to older generation and like said retro's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's classically retro .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's just an idea if you like it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ready for the next slide ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "see if it's there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which one is it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "interface concepts , no ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "interface concepts new .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "either refresh it , or it sh , didn't put it there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "mine will always read copy of something or other .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "copied mine before sent it over .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "looking at the interface concept , it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you wanna start the next slide .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can't really see , but there's two possible ways , on the left , if you see on the sides of the remote , you have the scroll down , so you have that option there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then also there's the idea of the base .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's like an idea there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then on the , we have what's really big trend now , it's the ipod .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's becoming really and so you have this very simplistic menu section with the round buttons , and it's like you have the both trendy and hip , but also very sleek and very simple , but technologically advanced .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if you wanted to do that if we could find way of like using that idea in remote control then look into it , but anyway , next .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as by sight .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you'd you're in the dark , you don't wanna be looking at the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button it's v_ , and so yo you're feeling v_ like volume up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what it really is v_ and what it you is down , because the down arrow .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so it's like criticism you'd probably turn that the other way up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then you have you could either do it by raised type , which could be , iffy , old-fashioned in way .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "either that or just have it by shape , you have specific triangular shape that you're looking at the up and down arrow .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then the round ones you feel by , that's the second one down , that thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's looking into how we wanted to do it by feel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is an example of going for certain demographic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is particularly geared towards children .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's very cute , and we could probably change it to yellow , bright yellow for like the for the company logo .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then the other thing that it would be able to do is just to pro be ab you program certain channels that only these children would watch , so it's like they ch watch , the c_ beebies like that , keep them away from other channels .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's like another ar , these are three examples looking at it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have the wider section for the main controls there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you could see how many buttons there are .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then on the left you have an example of the round buttons , and simpler design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on the bottom we probably wouldn't need that , because it's more for like d_v_d_ function which we are not gonna be using .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so again it's like just give you ideas and then down at the bottom you have the logos and that's where you could put the r_r_ , real reaction .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then finally these are like the same examples , but also some more , just possibilities that we could go with .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "none of them i'm particularly keen on by the way .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it's like just taking aspects out of that and saying , out of this one we like , the round section of , or we'd like the button size on this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or like , the black finish or the silver finish or whatever .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have four of those remotes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what's the title ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it'll be copy of component design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that looks like it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so basic remote operation runs as follows , press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit , chip senses the connection , chip produces morse code infra-red signal , specific to that button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you press the button , it produces signal that's encoded specifically for that button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the t_v_'s centre , which interprets the signal response accordingly , changes channel etcetera .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that being said next slide , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "findings which were the required materials for the basic internal construction , so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed , we need rubber for buttons , aluminium for battery contacts , integrated circuit which consists of diode , transistor , resonator , resistors , and capacitator , all those basic things that make circuit function .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "an l_e_d_ , which is light emitting diode , contact discs for the buttons , plastic for the casing , and power-source , whatever power-source we've actually determined we want .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "next slide , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "personal preferences , to save money for the components , the remote should be mass-produced and basic materials should be bought en masse .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we find another company who can produce the required chips , casing , l_e_d_ , any additional materials we decide we require at less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing , we should go for it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "next slide , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just talking to the manufacturing division .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they suggested power options , solar cells , hand dynamo , and kinetic power , so you shake it and it increases the power .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm not how the hand dynamo works , they have yet to get back to me on that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so next slide , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "suggested casing options .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can offer options for casing such as straight , curved , double-curved , very specific to the customer .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "options for materials , plastic , rubber , titanium , wood .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't think anyone's gonna go for wood one , because splinters .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would be amazing , though , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , splinters would what is that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "certain restrictions do apply here though .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "latex , you can't do solar power with latex one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , if they want some soft squishy rubber , they can't have the solar powered option .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "double-curved , you can't do titanium .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would be two curvatures , so it would actually , if you the shape of your hand , you curve here and you curve here , so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now if you wanted that , you can't do titanium .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so you functions what for the buttons , scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have one more slide .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , didn't .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the manufacturing division also has said that they have several types of chips and they've just developed sample sensor or sample speaker chip , which we could utilise .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "push button requires simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so depends on what we decide we wanna do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in addition to that if we're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote , we're going to have multiples of each type , like double-curved in rubber , each option should have certain select number produced with all those options .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we'll have to mix it up , make we produce enough of everyone .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five thousand , double-curved wooden remotes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that's all got .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "alright , for those informative presentations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's go back to now we have to make some decisions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "where were we ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let me just add one more thing that couldn't say before , and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this the thing we were talking about earlier .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "except that it's odd , and i'm no not exactly why they are explaining it in the way they are , there's sample sensor and there's sample speaker unit for so , you would say like , good morning , coffeemaker , and it would respond , good morning , jill , but i'm not exactly how it's gonna work , 'cause do you programme do we program the responses and the questions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question , and can't change it in order for it to be recognised , or can it be altered in certain way , or does the actually user program it , to say channel means this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like using the menu to be like , enter your name into the screen like on the menu options .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that way the remote reads it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's got like limited memory and programme it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's iffy , but that's what you'd say .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "feel like voice recognition would be , it would be too hard to really we could do it , but technology .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it's within our price to get that chip that would , technology .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we are making the chip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , but , we have to look at what our production cost is for the chip itself anyway .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it is growing trend , the higher technological , like the , just like the more advanced it is , the better it'll sell .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different , we'd have to decide on the power options , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that we could reduce cost .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause we need to know how big it's gonna be and how heavy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that brings us to this , let's see if we can decide what energy source we want to have first and foremost .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do we wanna go for batteries or stand like the one that we saw illustrated earlier ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the base , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the base , the charging base with rechargeable batteries ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the that's true .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "always feel like first wanna it looks like , before 'cause if it's something really small , then it's harder to imagine base for it , that was quite substantial size standing up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we don't have multiple things that it has to control , it just has to control the t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we need to decide , so we can figure how big it's gonna be , like exactly what buttons we want and exactly it could be like this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's not gonna be huge universal remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what size battery and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the other thing is like even if it's got few buttons , so we want it to be bigger than this , 'cause it still fits in your hand , so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial , but not necessarily full of buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'd , this one is really comfortable , like the sides whatever , because but if we have the , the locator , then we don't have to worry about that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are you gonna lose it easier ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we can make it small if we have locating device .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we do voice-activated locator , though , we're gonna be looking at more substantial chip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so honestly , the customer would be irritated by the fact that it has base if we did do small , compact .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's the other thing , it's like are we gonna have certain chips that are gonna require bigger size period ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "two double a_s , for this size .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but like , if we get more complicated then it's gonna be have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "agree , it's either gonna be bigger with base or smaller with just battery like this guy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we sh .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "smaller , without .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright , so what direction do you want to go in ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you wanna vote ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we had locating device with the small one , that seems way more advanced .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm leaning in the direction of this bigger and the base .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm away from the base .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the only problem with that is if you forget to take it out of your pocket and it goes in wash .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that just seems so clunky and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because if even looking at cellphones now , those trends the smaller the hotter it is , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "smaller and smaller , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've had three watches go that way too .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "watches i've but i've never washed cell phone .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "phone , whoa , that would , that would hurt .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what material do we want to be made out of ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have lots of options .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't think wood is viable option .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "titanium was saying that titanium , if we're being restricted then would probably lean away from that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what did you , go ahead .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause if it's gonna cost us more to produce chip , titanium will be more expensive .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "however , we only wanna sell it for twenty five euro ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what would you recommend ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce few in titanium , make them rarity so to speak .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that'll , exactly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the selling point , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we could do that , because all our research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more if good plan .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are we restricted by this ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should just focus on one design and one concept now.i'm not that we'll have the time and money to produce whole array of remotes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "twenty five euros so you're talking about like when it leaves our salesroom then it's all gonna be cherry-coloured or is it gonna be the kinda thing where people come back and swap it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if this was successful remote , we might then produce higher end version of it , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we wanna go for plastic , or what would you recommend for materials ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "honestly i'd recommend like since we're going with batteries instead of solar power , i'd recommend soft like latex , because we could produce , how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could do one that fits in with the trends of the year so , because this year is all fruit , only knows why , we could do cherry cover for this year and then if next year is stripes or solids , they could come back .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or we could like take off this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they could buy cases , if they wanted .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and buy the extra case .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's good to sell basic thing and then sell options .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we could do like hard base plastic , and then we could give two latex covers to start .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the what the top face , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because the soft latex definitely is squishy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "squishier than like , just hard plastic .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and what chip would we need for this guy ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how complicated are we gonna go with the voice activated , we could give it specific code , remote missing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't think we should do voice , we should just do the recognition for when it's lost , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause that what it type of , for voice activation would it be like certain term what we would say like , because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "see i'm strangely attracted to it , because know that's it's definitely gonna be big , because it's , it's just so high-tech .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "my little sister got for christmas she got one of those key finders that's like key-ring , and you have to whistle in certain frequency for it to work .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "see that would just irritate me .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then she would laugh and it would start going off in her purse , and you couldn't turn it off .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then voice activation won't be good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it became highly irritating .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so having key-phrase is much better .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it's not gonna be voice activated in the fact that you would say , channel up , and it would work , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , we just want it to be finder .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but then it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just , alright .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but do can your can the department make , brilliant then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that would be like mid-class .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we don't actually have to go for , if they've just developed the sample sensor , sample speaker , it's brand new chip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "why not introduce it in this way ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and what size batteries , double , triple ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "triple , it'll be lighter .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "could it run off of two they're more expensive though , too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "more come in package .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that depends on what the energy is needed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", we could do two or we could do one small lithium , 'cause the lithium batteries are doing quite most other electronic products , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so they're more widely available now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and they also have longer battery life than most batteries .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if you only have to replace it every five years .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's good point .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as long as we sell it with it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how about initial , you get one battery when you buy it , 'cause i'm pretty we can get them pretty cheap on bulk .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could think about it and come back to it next meeting .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we still have one more meeting .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we've covered that first category , user interface concept , meaning design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what's it gonna , what's it gonna look like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ki like your idea about the retro phone dial , and that the central button could have , our logo on it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it might be the four way scroll , too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it could be whatever , as long as there's something big in the middle , because like the old phones , there's like that just like piece of metal or like picture in the middle .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "my issue with that is if it got too big though , 'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle , then is it gonna get wider than your hands are , because and then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in the sample ones that you showed us there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side , which if we make it curved like hand like hand-shape like if we put the scroll-button on the side , that could be particularly useful .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "see what you mean .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we definitely if we have scroll things on the side , we definitely have to have labelled .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like on the side of it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it's just up and down volume or channel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it's just up and down .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but is that for which ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you could do some on both sides .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do we have both sides ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then , 'cause oth otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that you're just not holding it and it changes the chan .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the other option is in instead of scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "any other ideas ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to make that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on , so we'll have to like have little square , so that the our logo's available .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we should do it on button itself though , because if people are able to change the covers , the on-off button , something , some the menu button , but if we're gonna put our company logo on there and somebody could just get another one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like having the yellow strip at the bottom with the r_r_ like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that's at the bottom of it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "are they all gonna have our company logo on them ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't think we should do that , because that would just be icky .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so putting it on button is probably good idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we want it to be visible and are all those one that you showed where they were met silver-metallic looking ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but those are plastic , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they're not titanium .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like that look .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , or if it was really , for the base or if we're going for the retro look , like really shiny black would be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for our base one ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or like gun-metal grey , 'cause then it combines the silver and the black .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what are your thoughts ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there you go , gun-metal gray .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm just really wary of the putting anything on button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it'll wear off .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what's the button , then what's the button do , and how do that is what the button does ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "buttons wear off .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just looking at examples , you just don't ever see the logo on button , it's always on the actual casing

"yellow , like that idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like if we like the one all the way on the left , you ca you can see it on your computer better .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "where the button is actually blue , but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would illuminate yellow .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we'd have blue and yellow for the touch buttons
