[{"edus": [{"text": "for coming to this third meeting of the design group .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting suggestions for our new remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly and that people are prepared to pay premium better .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they've got lots of buttons on them that people don't use and find difficult to learn .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and people lose them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we thought that for our new remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that people use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that we want to go for long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the product and shape that will be instantly recognisable , as trendy remote control , and as real reaction product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that when people are happy with that , they will want to buy everything else from us .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so again , i'll we'll have the three presentations from the three of you and then we'll make final decision .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the decisions that we need to make today , finally , are what energy source we want to use , whether it is practical to use long lasting one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and our discussion was around the fact that if we're gonna go for long lasting power supply , then it's sealed for life and if anybody does manage to run one down , we'll give them another one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it it'll be , prominently displayed as part of the advertising literature that it's , for life , guaranteed for life .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now the internal chip and this is where need kate's expert advice and given that this has to go to market as quickly as possible do we go for custom designed chip ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or do we buy one off the shelf and programme it ourselves ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm not an expert on these things , but presumably , there must be loads of already on the market that we can modify .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that that's your area of expertise .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then the , the overall design of the case is kendra's field and we had some discussions last time as to how we might go forward and we'll finalise those da today .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and thi this is all linked in with the user interface , whether we go for voice , buttons , or bit of both .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then , for the next meeting kate will be looking at the look , feel and design , kendra the ho how the user actually uses it and andrew the product evaluation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and kate and kendra will be producing model for us to look at .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , if we can have the three presentations again , and perhaps you'd like to start .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll just be talking about the components design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , looked at what exactly do remotes do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they for you to press key or give voice command and then this is translated into light signals which are then seen by the t_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the materials we're gonna need to look at the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip works in conjunction with diode transistor or resonator , two more resistors and capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with resistor and capacitor .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what happens is you'll press number or give voice command and this creates connection within the remote thows the chip then senses this connection and produces signal in morse code format .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this signal's sent to the transistor which amplifies it and then sends it on to the light emitting diode and which is then trai changed into infrared light which is sent to the t_v_ and seen by the t_v_ and which changes the channels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so as for how we should end up using this in our remote couple of main questions are the buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the fewer buttons you have , the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "however to not have buttons or to use voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult and raise the production cost .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's something we should think about .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "also we have to work within the company constraints , and the company has informed me via email that they're experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most cost-effective way of producing it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use , so was thinking perhaps combination of solar cells with back-up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that will last the lifetime or the five to ten years and we could still keep that original idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we also need to look at the chips , custom-designed versus off the shelf , and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all seem to have upon .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "however that's gonna cost more , but the off the shelf is gonna be cheaper and it's gonna be allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster , but it's going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like voice activation , which haven't really been used much on remotes , so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to convert , so if we were definitely gonna go with the voice option we'd probably have to design our own chip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that sums it up .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so how , can you just put that one back up again , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "inevitably custom design chip is gonna be more expensive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do we know by how much ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't actually have any price information , no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and do we know how long it'll take to develop custom chip .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it lot longer than an off the shelf chip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we did the problem is the voice technology is not really highly developed , it's still in an ex experimental form , so it would it's hard to predict the time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we need to make decision here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply , that would appear to effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now before we go round everybody else , does anybody have any have anyti ha anything to say about that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have question about that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "does it make difference if there are just few commands , if you can pre-programme in like numbers one through ten and pre-programme say , nine channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then you've programmed in say b_b_c_ four as your channel one , as your favourite , it's like to have certain number of favourites and that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just to incorporate the voice activation in it is sorta the trick .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "once you've got the whole voice chip in there , then it's the world the sky is your limit , but to actually the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then it doesn't matter .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "must say find it slightly surprising given that , mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so for slightly different no , it's if you speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you , so bu the this information is from is this is the internal company information , is it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "bits of it , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , true , again but if it's without any price informations that's difficult to decide .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "mobile phones do tend to be more expensive , hundred and fifty pounds .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as opposed to the twenty euros , twenty five euros .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also lots of mobile phones have got lot of technology in them , not just that , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's like it's you can't 'cause mobile phones are expensive , you can't say it's the voice recognition bit that is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "su if given that the technology is not developed and given that it's never been done before , the double risk , perhaps we ought to stick to buttons , since the last thing we want to do is present product that doesn't work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "another thought , go ahead .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would was just gonna say mayb it sh like we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's fundament it it's something we've discussed since the beginning , so in our minds it's fundamental , but that the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that , so you have to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "kinda we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it , then we should have it for the whole thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we've been talking about it the whole time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "anyway , i'm incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "from my presentation show , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it should be , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , that sounds good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it will have voice recognition if that means if that means we can't afford buttons but second question , do we need the five buttons for channel change , up down , volume up down and on off , just as backup or just so that people can just sit there pressing buttons ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would say we do , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "did you want to say anything ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "nope , that was it , that was it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "shall we move rapidly on to kendra ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ra rapidly move the cable over .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it gonna work ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's thinking about it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it'll get there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so did some research on the internet and what , the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users , commands and mechanisms for the operation , and there're just variety of choices .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "findings , so lot of times they tend to look cluttered and these were just couple examples of different kinds that are little bit more unusual .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there're some special ones available , like this one here , which is marketed towards children , different designs , and one of the things that we need to watch out for is v_ in volume because people some bring little picture of what ours could look like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so just minimise the clutter , avoid too many buttons and also one of the things that people have used is slide button , like you have on mouse , that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , have the slide button on the side , and then you can pre-programme the channels , the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if interrupt you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you wanna say anything about slide controls ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're si simple , cheap and reliable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they're about the same cost really .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's just the there's lot of slide buttons out there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's the same connection .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "fair enough , fine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just because if i'm using mouse like to be able to slide it up and down so it might be good for volume to just be able to roll it and then have the up and down and then the this is my little drawing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "good , good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so three there's three buttons on slider .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "three buttons , channel up down and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you got channel up down , we can have slider in that as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because if it if you no if you notice on the thing it like has got if you it like sticks , if what , up like one unit , if you see what .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it kinda goes up one , then like you can keep rolling it up , but it's like cog .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you kinda take it up one at time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the only advantage was thinking of to having the buttons , like the buttons on one side for the channel , and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand , and you pick it up , it's easy to know , this is just the volume and this is the channel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this one on the one side and one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you could as like mouse you could , like the shape of it almost like mouse , with dep if it depending on the final shape of it , 'cause you could have like , it looks like you can control the volume with your thumb , and then you could control the buttons with your fingers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ye , 'cause i've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume , or vice versa , so it'd be kinda good to have them be feel completely different .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you'd you were fiddling with .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or the thi this is what the we have to come up with is the actual shape that people can ins instantly pick it up and know it's going to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we we're looking at sliders for both volume and channel change of one sort .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was thinking just for the volume , but what do you think ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just for the volume , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause if , in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling , just the way it would , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's it , it seems to me that it al also has the advantage that it the two are clearly different , that there's no possibility of confusing the two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm just gonna pass this along .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's is that you want to say at the mo , fine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here we go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is my report on trend watching .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the data's come off internet from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we got reports from paris , milan on new fashions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the most important aspect is the look it has to look fancy , look and feel instead of the current functional look and feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is st was gonna say twice as important as the second aspect , which is the technologically innov innovative side of it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so and the third being easy to use is probably given , we have to try and incorporate , so exactly , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that what we're suggesting ought to address all three of those .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that out of sequence ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and from the fashion watchers from milan and paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes , et cetera .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "clothes , shoes and furniture and spongy material to be used on the outside .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "hadn't thought of that , that's different , certainly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but was gonna say , fruit and vegetables , important to this year important to furniture , i'm just gonna say like it's in if fashion if we're going for the it looks fancy , then fashion is the line we gotta be going through .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but fashions do don't last very long .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that can kinda tie into our changing face things , like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year and whatever happens next year , we can have the face plates , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can have sp like spongy skin on it and then we can just whip that off and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like the kind you get on like hand weights .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", that weird what that is , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "also means you can drop it without damaging it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", it's good as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have we could if we could save depending on the cost of the product itself , could we have cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "instead of having ten year guarantee ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "with interchangeable covers , could just buy new one every year , new one when new fashions come out .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it its that's an interesting idea , it's like the old swatch watch where on only batteries ever got changed in those , 'cause people just bought new one when it went out of fashion , but it's just never been seen as fashion item before .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's yes if they're made in sufficient quantity we can but my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last , long time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wh what if we included the batteries in the cover ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy whole new one , because you don't feel like you're investing in whole new product .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy new one every year then it it's even better .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so like , so can see that thing ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also encourages to buy new covers and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", know the only the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it you've then got the connection and you've immediately got unreliability , whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that the whole thing is all , completely soldered together and it , total reliability , but you're saying and understand where you're coming from .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just this as examples .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , that's true .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or , but like more than just the battery , like complete different like you've only got like , like this bit's the bit you keep , and this is the expensive bit , this is like the chip and this is the microphone .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then this is the power source and the bit everyone sees .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then , you probably are .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we're gonna go down that route , then we're talking about even if it costs slightly more than that , just building the whole thing in one , then having getting cheaper production costs and , giving people the option of buying new complete new thing , the advantage of replaceable cover is that even if they don't it doesn't have cover on , it will still work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then if , if people lose the cover , they might be nclined to go out and spend however many euros on new one rather than complete new re remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that that's just it with the covers , you're tricking into continuing to spend their money on our products without making feel like they're being ripped off having to buy new product .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it is it's up to it's up to , it's up to our marketing people to ma turn it into fashion item .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just another five euro to get .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , as external fashions change , then we get new covers on the market and , readily available .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's the thing , once you get the mould set , you can just whip out different colours , different pictures very quickly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like they have for mobile phones that are just fruits and animal prints and colours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we hadn't finished your it's the thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their coffee table to say this says something about me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't worry it's all said , was just gonna say , are we gonna make this as part of like part of the like it the fashions apply to furniture , so are we gonna make this part of the furniture ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is fashionable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is fashionable with .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", i'm with it , i'm up to date .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , the design that i've got , and it could be home-made design , this says this is not just television remote control , this is , fashion accessory .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the basic shape is what we given that we've got one on off button presumably , two buttons for channel change and one slider and nothing else , we need to decide on the just the basic shape of the thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , know whether we go down the fruit and veg route , and don't suggest we make it look like banana , but know the organic , curved look , to deliberately get away from the , the square look of most current remotes and , whether the , the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or 'cause there's certainly , the corporate logo needs to be prominently displayed so that people looked at it and say , that's real reaction remote control , want one of those .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that we should make the whole thing yellow kinda thought with you'd have like yellow circle with the r_r_ in it somewhere on it , but i'd yellow seems bit of strong colour to make the ent like the thing no , but just like white or grey or black or some blah colour .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the or , i'd .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no agree , we're simply it's simply required to incorporate the corporate logo prominently .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and make that fashion symbol as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was kinda picturing like shape that's almost like mouse .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is the whole point , yes , i'm i've got real reaction remote control to go with my real reaction coffee maker or whatever .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then people , people demand more real reaction .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that , when they hold it it's because mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand we could make it slightly different shape so they could hold on to it , but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and have the power , wherever , somewhere .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that was just an idea that had .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no that there's the sim my idea was something probably bit fatter than this but tha that sorta shape so that you can just ho hold it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you'd want it narrower than mouse though 'cause it mouse you're kinda just resting on it , you want something you can definitely grip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it t's it's mouse , but held , so it's you sorta hold it in your hand like that , with , and fiddling with the buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it'd be , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and fiddle around with it and press it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , little wider than this , 'cause this is pretty comfortable to hold , and then if you had , then wider up here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "almost like hairbrush , like you could get the about the width of that end of the pen and then it widens up top and you can fiddle an .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then it would have wider thing to have the light , the infrared light at the t_v_ and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume and the power could be wherever , up the top .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what do you think about that ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that sounds i'm just i'm suddenly realising that we're discussing how much how good it's gonna be to change channels we still can just tell it to .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are we starting to get away from the voice functionality of it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's very good point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it is very good point .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we decided that we're actually going down both routes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that the we need the manual controls and that they should be of that form , but that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but do , this shape also les lend itself to voice 'cause if you're holding it and you're fiddling , but you can also bring it up like that and it's microphone-esque , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then you just bring it up to your mouth and just speak to it , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and just say , suppose sup so we could have menu button as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we cou like we're leaving out the buttons for the less frequently used , but we could incorporate that into the voice .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "honest my personal view is that if it's not there , people wouldn't use it anyway .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "suppose , but there is the off chance that , the brightness is wrong on your t_v_ or the contrast needs changing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's cer it's certainly possible , but they we we're going beyond given the state of the technology we want something that we kno we know will work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can still incorporate the voice with less buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if the power button was also somehow like menu button you could press that and or do voice commands , and either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like and you could scroll through brightness and sc and then you can minimise the buttons and still have those , brightness and tint and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's good idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we we're i'm getting clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could have the channels and the power and then menu button and then the volume .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons and the volume .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we if we're going down that route , then we need some display .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do we need some display ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the television would be the display that things like that usually pop up on televi like you hit menu and menu will come up on television and have like tint brightness , and you'd use the scroll , scroll through it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's on the t_v_ , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we actually use the television , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then , press that is , that might work .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on onto like mouse , the ru the scrolling button , is actually button as , you could press it , you could press that and have it as menu button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", that's true .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "never understood how that worked though , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's like , it's like the mouse where you just kinda click it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you just press it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you could just click that to so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we got five minutes to go in this meeting , so we've actually very conveniently just come to good point to sum up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so kate and kendra now go away and pa play with bit of plasticine or play-dough , whatever it is on the other side of the atlantic .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "play with play-dough .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and actually put what we've discussed into something was gonna say concrete , but that's slightly inappropriate word to something that we can see and andrew can go away and think about how we can actually market this as concept and not just simple remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can get some things clear just for my sake .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "our energy source is gonna be long term .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we decided that we're gonna for simplicity of , manufacturing and maintenance that we will go for long term battery source , on the basis that , if we're going for making it fashion statement , then people are more likely to change it anyway before it runs out and make an assumption that we can aim for battery that will last most people for we'll say at least five ten years and that we'll we will guarantee it for five years .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we're having custom chip ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're having custom chip , but given the we've cut the functions down , that will hopefully not be too
