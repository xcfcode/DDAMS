[{"edus": [{"text": "welcome back after lunch , hope you had good lunch together .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for this meeting the main agenda to discuss about the conceptual design meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the agenda will be the opening and that's the product manager or secretary that's me and the presentations from the christine and agnes and from mister ed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and finally in this meeting we have to decide and we are to take decision on the remote control concept and the functional design so we have forty minutes , it's little bit low , but hope we can finish it up so i'll handle to the functional team , to the christine , to discuss about the components concept .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , if you could open the powerpoint presentation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm number two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you're number two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the next one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "components design , there we go .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so can we put it in slide show mode ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "here , is that little that one , yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll take the mouse .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we were looking he specifically at the components the following components , the case , the power supply , the means of communications with the television set .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in instance we had talked about using some speech recognition , you have to have microphone no you don't actually haven't have to have microphone in the device , but you do have it way it has to it has to hear the speaker and , so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , but somewhere you have to put the microphone , and way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the other thing that we so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "our method for going about this is we've looked at the histo hi historical record , what's worked , what hasn't and then we also we wanted to evaluate some new materials and we contacted manufacturing for their input because , course , we might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , so this is the approach that we took during our research .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so for the case , we told we were making specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "course , wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , but that doesn't seem to be one of the choic non-option we can really explore , so then we were thinking about rubber , but unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat factor and there might be some problems with the how it's goes with the board .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after while , so we still had titanium and wood available , but unfortunately titanium's also been eliminated , the people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make curved cases out of titanium , although how apple did it with powerbook i'm not su quite but nevertheless they've eliminated all of our options except wood .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , this is our finding .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "at least it's environmentally friendly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and as she said , it's an environmentally friendly material , so we're currently proposing , we'll get to all my personal preferences in just second .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so then there's this other matter of the chips and could use simple design on the board , but these simple chips , but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much intelligence with this simple one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then there was the regular which regret that i've forgotten exactly why i'm eliminating that one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the other option was this advanced chip on print , and we liked we found that it includes this infrared sender , which 'member the beam was that was an important component of finding the chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and manufacturing has told us that they've recently developed sensor and speaker that would be integrated into this advanced chip on print , so we now jumping to our personal preferences i'd really think we should , use some of some really exotic woods , like , you come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some woods .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that people will might really want to design their own cases , you see , they could do this three-dimensional design on the internet , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit custom car order , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , and then think we should go with the solar cells as the microphone and speaker on the advanced chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is the findings of our research and my recommendations for the new remote control would be to have it be made out of wood .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you have any problems with that ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can you go back one slide ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm not , how do , know , let's see .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let's go back up here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , question , what's mean exactly , advanced chip on print ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what's the meaning of that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's multiple chip design and it's printed on to the circuit board .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "could find out more about that before the next fi next meeting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is it means it's on the is it on micro-proc micro-processor based or , tha that would be , so if you find out from the technology background , so that would be good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but i'll find out more at our next meeting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "why was the plastic eliminated as possible material ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because it gets brittle , cracks we want we expect these remote controls to be around for several hundred years .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "good ex good expression .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "whic which although with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems , wouldn't you , it chips , it if you drop it , it's i'm not su if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work , but you can't just use , exactly , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "speak for yourself , i'm planning to be around for while .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you're not convinced about the wood , yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually , i'm ready to sell it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm ready to sell it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood , but there are some very pretty woods out there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and you could sell oils with it , to take care of it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'m glad you , good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's actually very innovative idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "sorr having hard time keeping wi control over my face .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's actually very innovative different idea that you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's each person is gonna have their own personalised , individualised speech recognition remote control in wood , that's not on the market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it it's looks good the design the functional design , what about yo you ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , in yes , in term in terms of comments first then , let's move to agnes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in turns of .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "she works in the cubicle next to me so she's she was already little bit prepared for this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "luckily ed was not .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can get the quality materials then it shouldn't influence the design principles too much , which you'll see with my presentation .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one thing we'd have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your it's really good if your dog gets ahold of it , they can use it for teething .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , have to see how kid-friendly it is and all that , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they do that anyway with the rubber and plastic , so , and chew up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they do it with other materials as , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and chew up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you're you are in participant three .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one point three , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , it's very short presentation , 'cause i'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board so if you want to just go straight to the second slide , which shows , took the ideas that we were talking about last time and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , which completely agree with christine's idea to have it molded , so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the standard very straight remote controls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do quasi-measurements on their hand size , so if someone has larger hands , you have wider remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my hand is different size than yours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , that's actually really good idea for customi customisability .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one thing might be interesting is to put flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones , so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , especially if you have little kids around , they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch t_v_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and also you had issues with the batteries running out , so we could put little battery life-light on it that goes dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and in terms of invisible features , audio and tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , in terms of what this thing would actually look like despite working in interface design , i'm not the greatest artist in the world , so you'll have to forgive me .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , in the corner and by itself , so you don't accidentally turn your t_v_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then you have one of those toggle displays for , channels and volume , for surfing channels and then volume , so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then here you'd have your standard , telephonish number pad .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your t_v_ and on the other side way to turn off the voice control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that if the user doesn't want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so again you can have little light somewhere , the flip thing and have forgotten anything ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , as you can see , it's very simple design , which is one of the things really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "think the design can carry over to everything , although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "be like copper hinge or .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you also have to start watching out for the weight , 'cause depending on how much the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you don't want it to start getting too heavy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that's the general layout with the general functionalities , if we come up with something else .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as you can see , there's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customisably , you can make this thing fairly small or fairly large , depending on personal preferences .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , that's all had to say , everything else in terms of design issues .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the centering of the key pad and the channel is just depending on where your thumb is and you tend to use the volume control and the browsing more than the actual number pad , so that would be in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control , the number pad little bit lower 'cause it's used less frequently .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning , but more or less it should go along those lines .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what's your , the comments or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's what consumers want .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's almost like , houston , we have product here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "problem is gonna be cost .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "also have very simple presentation , because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "also have copied different type of remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you can find me , where i'm at .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there should only be one in here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's being modified .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they're stealing our product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we've been giving simple questionnaires in different areas because we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today , 'cause trends change very quickly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in six months this idea is already gone out the window , so it's gonna be question how fast we can act .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they already erased the rest of mine , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , go to findings .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause had another comment there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the market trend .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is what we know from the last from the questionnaires from the all the surveys we've done , fancy and feel-good , that's what we've been looking for , something that feels good in the hand , that's easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "looking for next generation of innovation , because all the remotes out there now , they're all very similar , they all do the same thing , we have to have something completely different .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "easy to use , has always has become another major interest that , with the whiteboard we can see that it's remote that's easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so even if we have product that may be more expensive , if it comes out , if they look it looks and feels good and has technology .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the second two , you can see the last one is very easy simple design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the second one , there is about forty-five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read , very hard to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the first one , see that they put in display .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now there's something else with the little flip-up , now we're adding all kinds of things in , but with the little flip-up , if you have little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the display also makes it easier to use , because sometimes when you're looking for buttons , if you see display because i've seen mostly the standard ones , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "context-sensitive instructions , depending on what the tel what mode the t_v_ or the d_v_d_ else is in .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now you have it now you have one with the very simple also .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the idea is simple , but with display , so you can see what you're doing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if we can incorporate the easiness of use , trendy , fancy , feels good , with display , wood , designer wood , designer colours , we might've .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like some foam rubber ball , and then they would squeeze it , and it would take the shape of their hand .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's really molded to your specific but for that you'd also have to do an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to an and then you would know like what the geometry of their hands would be and yes you'd wood to get .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how hard they squeeze ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", you wouldn't wanna go too far down that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that actually would increase the revenues we could expect , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the sales , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , but incorporating the three it'd be something new on the market , different and from although , what it was nokia that came out with this changeable colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "already the customisability is really good new gimmick .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you take it apart , and put on another face , take it off and put on another face and then they sold millions , millions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that took off , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so say with the findings , with the research , easy to use something new .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have to come up with something new that is not on the market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we'd also have to wor consider that who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes , we might wanna learn about labour laws .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in different countries and wher so we can do it cheap , but you don't wanna exploit labour in third world countries .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so actually you could turn it turn around and say that you're par the reason the cost is high for the device is because you're paying working wage to the person who made the device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we can get production in , countries like , india yes , countries like india or china or malaysia , so you can go better features and better price and you can sell more .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "cost of living is low .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , so yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "good , that'd be something that manufacturing would have to explore more and to where .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "where it would be manufactured is another step .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , so yes , but that we can that we can talk about the production later , depends on the quantity , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're here to design , come up with product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we don't need to have our own fabric factory , so we can have tie-up with who the do the fabric , for the different electronics items , then we can have business tie-up and to get to cut the cost , to sell more .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , but le let's decide first about the components concept and interface concept , if is acceptable for both of you , what ed was talking .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and your design whether you want with the display or without display or just simple , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it depends , it's good idea , but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be because theoretically with the t_v_ you already have big display in front of you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , if we're trying to keep costs down , then sacrificing the display is way to go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it depends on how much putting display costs and what it would be used for very specifically what it would be used for , 'cause if it's only used for one little thing , then putting in big display case or big display that's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever , may not be the most cost-efficient way to go , but that's just speculation , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what do you think ed ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed , do how much it costs , to add little display like this ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no spec it's 'cause we have to find out cost on it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you wanna take an action item to go find out ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no that's no problem .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm here for the pushing it after it's made .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "will market it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "once we get price on it then we can market it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the advanced chip on print is what we've deci we've determined and the engineering industrial design is the recommendation , and we've kinda come to some agreement regarding this concept of wooden case .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "customisable and don't , no , they could be rubber like they are now , so you have that tactile experience of so are we done with this meeting ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "beautiful mahogany red wooden case .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what about the buttons , would the buttons be wood too , or .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what we'll do is , we will stick with the simple design for time being until ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra , in case we go for the display .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what you can do is , both of you , you can come up with the prototype , the model .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "hope , if is it if they will come up with the prototype design , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then they can show you how it looks like , and then we can submit to the will submit to the management .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then meantime you can come up with the price , how much it's cost as extra for the display .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and marketing strategy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "an and the marketing strategy , that's very important , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and marketing strategy , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how much you can how mu how much you can sell extra .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you'll make money too , so it it's not only pay-out , you make money too , your commission .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , any questions ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , by next meeting , so , come up with the prototype , then we can proceed from there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so for all your efforts and coming for the meeting again , and see you soon then .", "speaker": "A"}], "id": "xxxxx", "relations": [{"y": 1, "x": 0, "type": "Explanation"}]}]
