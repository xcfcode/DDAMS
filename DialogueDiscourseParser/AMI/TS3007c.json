"speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with the type and the supplements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so where to put what button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and would say jans , can you begin ?", "speaker":

"speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", i'll be talking about the components .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what did was reviewed previously used items by two different age groups .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "below forty five and above .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and watch what the differences are and checked , what do we want , and how can we aim at the target group .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what found was that senior citizens ye , it's .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they , they like more the they like the traditional materials , like wood and such more .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wood and chrome .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they like straightforward shapes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they like luxurious styles , where whereas the young and dynamic , they like more soft materials .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "think of the teletubbies , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "soft and fluffy and colourful and , shapes are curved and round .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you get the picture .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they like sports and gaming , and that gives them the vitality .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , firs yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one little question .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "about the material .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "soft material for remote control ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , i'll get to that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you you'll see .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "first off , let's start with the energy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "had choice between few different sources .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the two basic sources that found were the best possible were the battery versus kinetic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "kinetic , that's when you move something , then it gets energy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "figured , that's ki kinda high-tech , when you have remote control that , when you pick it up , it has power .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that would be actually very , figured .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we could also use battery , that's bit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but when the power gets low , you have to shake it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you just you have to shake it around little bit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then it has some more energy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you could just go for battery .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or you can go for both ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have you considered the option of using solar panel ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the thing is about solar panel is you have to have light .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you could use normal light , but you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from battery .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for ultimate use of solar panels , you could actually use you could use solar panels , but you ha you'd have to implement them into the remote control , leaving you bit less space for the interface .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's too less space .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it what's actually just in i've figured it out that , seeing that you'll always be within the distance of t_v_ , and the from t_v_ there comes whole bunch of light .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it would actually power itself from t_v_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , you just take up all the space , and you wouldn't have the full amount of power actually used .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you prefer kinetic ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so prefer kinetic because it's , the costs aren't that much higher , and , ju just bit more high-tech than normal battery .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if no , but , you pick it up and you press buttons and , you , actually it is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you don't move remote control too much .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's enough to keep the energy level .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it if it isn't , you just shake it bit and add with power up again .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , what jarek said , you could use battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and for rest , you'd just add juice on the battery .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and when the battery doesn't work , usually shake it too .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so like slamming on it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's exactly the same .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so that , furthermore , you we checked the cases .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have different options concerning the cases .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you ha you sim you simply add basic standard model it was square and figured that's bit boring .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you we could go for the single curved or the double curved .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "single curve , it's just , it's just curve .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or but you could go in an double curves .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that's like several different dimensions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that gives you an whole new effec , that gives you younger and more high-tech look , figured .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , that we'll discuss later .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , are you going to draw it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you want me to draw in three-d_ ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", ca could show you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'t imagine how it looks like .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "could show you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let's say you let's say that's your standard that's bit your standard design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you could actually go like something like this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then in three-d_ effect you could go so you just , this is this bit difficulty in didn't take major in art .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so but you could have whole new the back the depth , you could just play around bit with .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you don't have to use standard you could it leaves more space for creativity .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that might be an idea , but just , furthermore , plastic versus rubber ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you we could choose what what's better , plastic or rubber .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ch prefer rubber because it feels .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's soft and it's that like soft .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the material the younger people want , ain't it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "plastic is plastic also has that cheap feeling to it , like plastic your usually associate plastic with something that's cheap .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's just me , but , we could , talk about it later .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "furthermore , buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "traditional or touch screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we discussed it in previous meeting , so figured i'll just leave it at the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and chip set , if we are going to use traditional buttons , we could go with simple chip set .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if we decide to go on screen , we would use an we have to use an advanced chip set .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that would bring the necessary costs with it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's something we have to keep in mind .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it isn't manageable budget-wise , we'd have to go over to sim to simple buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we're going to sell tell ten millions of them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so bet big company in korea or taiwan , like samsung , can give us big discount on the chips , so usually , chips are aren't more expensive than one dollar .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "probably , but , that's that shouldn't be that big issue .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that shouldn't be real issue , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll just add , put big summary here , so we could discuss it bit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what are your ideas concerning battery versus kinetic ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you should use kinetic as back-up .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you should we should combination .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you use the battery and charge it up with kinetic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when you pick it up , it charges up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like an aku acu , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just like the watch from seiko .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what do you think ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would prefer both too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would bring the some more costs , but the who cares , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the project manager's problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "buy fifty cents battery and have something in my presentation to cope with that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "fifty cent , why doesn't and then we have single-curved versus double-curved .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , we'll just and , plastic versus rubber .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "isn't possible to make combination with rubber is or bendable remotes where you've got .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you , figured it will be rather than hard nah , rubber this is casing , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or do you rubber casing , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "rubber casing , because you use an touch-screen , it's just casing around it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , you could go for plastic , but figured would choose rubber .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ask it now the question that have .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it possible of is it necessary to make touch-screen square ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it isn't , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that touch-screens are generally square .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's the case you put around it that makes the shape .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're we put fashion in electronics , so we can .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that isn't , that would cover it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if you have square screen , and you put case around it that has like bulbs or that covers part of the screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that that's it's custom customisable and , me too .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that would solve the problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what are the opinions ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "rubber or plastic ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you seemed to hesitate bit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as long as it's firm , and you don't it's not bendable , that goes too far .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it shouldn't flop over when you hold it in your hand no , that that's gonna the chip set will hold it firm in place , and screen also it might .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "tra traditional versus , figured we all set on that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , then also the simple versus advanced .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "figure if we go for l_ , we should have the advanced .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that shouldn't be problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's my , you're welcome .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can do my thing ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it expert map .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do your thing , tim .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do your thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "bring it on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "last week went to paris and milan for some trend-watching .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "our research and development department and went to paris and milan .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in paris and milan , we asked different people , differing in age and in income , the amount of money to spend , what they like in design and material nowadays .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "our main audience , so that's people below forty , prefer the following .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "at first , the colours of fruit .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "very basic colours , like janus explained .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fresh colours , green , red , strawberry red , yellow , banana yellow .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "considering material , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they like spongy material , like sponge-ball .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like soft material .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "janus mentioned it also .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "he did some findings himself .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the teletubbies sh , you could .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you wer you weren't in paris ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like big flashy colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "our secondary audience , people above forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "materials like wood that no just no , but just wooden look .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but wood is not material you which you build remote control of .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but never seen one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wooden look , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like you have those fake panels on the floor .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the that isn't wood anyway , but ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , that's our secondary audience .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , we decided to take the people below forty .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , that this doesn't apply .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there're some overall thoughts about new remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they have to look fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they should be technological in innovative .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that means there have to be fancy things in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that's common .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "my personal preferences .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have to aim at mu at the main audience .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , therefore use fresh colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would you prefer that you can choose the colour of your remote control or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll come to that in second point .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to customise your own remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like the nokia the removable covers , just put red on it and go to the shop and buy green one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "third , material being used could be like rubber .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it fits within the current market trends .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it adds safety to your remote when you drop it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so to come back to your question , and the people in milan and paris also think that the rubber should be pretty hard .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like seen on regular mobile phones .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "actually , they have lot in common .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the phones and the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "actually saw phone that you could use as remote , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you could use your remote as phone .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that might be next step .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are numbers on it , so that you say s_p_s_s_ , and it goes to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in my second sheet of personal preferences , we have to reconsider the speech function recognition .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's very innovative .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak speech recognition and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , we have to keep the cost in mind , but it , it can be very expensive .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "twelve fifty when your parents are watching some boring program , you can take the remote and do something else .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "building games like snake or tetris to amuse the younger users .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "also the link with mobile phones .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you don't use that games when you watching television , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , but no , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you don't use games when you're making telephone call .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's just the same .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "when you're at college .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you take your remote with you to school .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you take your remote control with you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you al you also take you take your ipac and go play games .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do that , but , and third , stick with it , the log-in functionality with the slogan , take parental control to new dimension .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the interface contents .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's just simple powerpoint mock-up want to make it more as dynamic for you so i'll draw there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , the main concept is take one big touch screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "always display the primary buttons clear and visible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "even li like this with uses of lot of space .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and make the menu structure changeable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if you press system , that's , multiple system options can , five or ten or one , can fit in .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or even step further when you want to have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and other buttons can may be displayed here if that's necessary .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , how do we want to look at does remote look , it's you've gotta hold it in one hand .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the middle like all remotes have to be in little bit small , so you can put it in inside your hands .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and some remotes you can use with your thumb .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that's too difficult for this one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can make it little broader .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and use your thumb on the main buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and use your other hands on the menu structure .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so here are gonna be the program buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one , two , three , four , et cetera .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the volume control and program control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , down here , added , this could be one big .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the menu structure .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can use it in this way .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one thing you've gotta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "know that if you are changing the menu structure here , and , still believe you should keep displaying the buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if you're programming the colour of the t_v_ , do not display twenty other options that are possible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just keep it as simple as possible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and do not use too many levels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do not have to select screen first and then brightness and then colour and un-plus , and push plus twenty times .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but just the just in one button if possible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , you kn you all know the t_v_ levels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "channel one , two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and when you get to ten , ye and want to go back , you have problem .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just most modern t_v_s , you press one zero , and it goes to ten .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and else , to one and through after that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the button less .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , things like teletext , put them in the menu .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what do you think about back-and-forth come-up button ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", find must trying to tell it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like in internet explorer .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is volume plus and minus ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and this is program plus and minus .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but does it that is for going from four to five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but if you go from two to eight , and you want , and on two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or if you're watching studio sports on seventeen , and your wife is watching some soap on two yes , that's good idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that you can switch easy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , my preference would to be put it in the menu structure .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if you're using that button lot of times , the menu will still be displayed on the screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you just don't have to play games in-between .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if you're really switching between two channels , you won't have time to use the other options .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "already told that .", "speaker": "B"},

and the voice recognition .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's not too much decision on that one so that parental control is good function to put in the remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how you think about it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "agree , just put it in the menu structure somewhere .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "system properties , parental control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but what see how see it is you put it on the remote and then you have like windows log-on screen with parents , children .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "something like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and when you want to use the parents option , you have to , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it has to be fast .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you don't want to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and twenty seconds for the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no but most people find it much more important that their children don't watch sex or violence on the television , and ten or fifteen seconds longer , so they can finally watch it because of that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you may use like when there's x_p_ , simple log-on , you just push one or two or three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "pu push parents .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if you push parents , then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that then you have to go to three-digit log-in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to log in .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if you puts ye .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like two one three .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it's in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if you push children , you don't have to log in , but you can only watch children's channels or .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it automatically goes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it's worth the time and effort we are going to spend on it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because t's simple function , but it's gonna take lot of resources and lot of time to programming it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because you'll have to start working with the profiles and such .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and i'm not if it's actually worth investing that much time and effort into it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what but , if you want to if we in incorporate the parental control , let's say we do , and whatever , cho child just goes up to the t_v_ and presses up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's there's big market for it , because you , you read many times in magazines same , and you heard on the news that he , they believe that children are influenced by the television , and , we're aiming to below forty years .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but there are lot of people will below forty who have children in young age who want to not watch violent or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "some idea on that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just make through remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , 'cause if my grandad would buy this remote , he wouldn't want to bother with all the things to do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just make it an option in menu , ins install powerful profiles .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's better idea ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it just has to be when it's deliver out of the store , it has to be just simple and plain .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but if you want to install it personally if got kids , and could choose between two remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one with parent control and one without , and would buy the one with .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "with and one without .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", still some question have about how to incorporate those ones .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you're thinking about some channels they cannot see , but , when , for the for all the standard channels , and only for after ten o'clock in the evening violent films and movies will come and some timing will be needed

i'm not because for that to happen , you will have to receive signal from the remote control , so it would , have to be constant signalling .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what may be better is to incorporate an separate device that you can program with the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that provides parental control , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that's just an optional device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so there's that's there's besides the remote control , you'll have separate ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wouldn't put it in an optional device .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that then it becomes too much , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we do it , we must do it in ways that like profile , parent profile , and family profile , and otherwise .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and when you install another device , children can still go up to the t_v_ , pop open the thing and go to channel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "on separate menu option .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's true , but at same instant , same happens when you have remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so but , only difference is the people buying the remote control will now get the added feature of parental control , and those people wouldn't necessary want it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , you you'd be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it's just an added feature .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and what do you think of the games in the voice recognition ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "personally think that becomes too much .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", mail too from management that it's very popular to use voice recon recognition .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's more like it gets you to the functionality , but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but don't think when you're watching t_v_ , hearing loud noises from the t_v_ , someone screaming one , and you the channel switches , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like voice recognition is too much , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "see games happening .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can put it on chip anyway , so as long as it's isn't primary feature of the remote , but optional in but how we do it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that doesn't co , that doesn't cost lot of extra resources , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that will that must be in it , you think ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that will be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the games are in it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the voice recognition are not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the parental control are optional ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's in it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but too ma so , but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "also it's good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we should make it too complex .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is some menu function , you choose parental control , and four files will emerge from menu where put it on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but how it's gonna work will be problem .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but will there like the first idea from you can buy it without and with parental contr control ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or are we going to put it in and just ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ye best would be to put it in and make it an menu option .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to put , to put it in always .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can put on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you can just when you buy it , you can select personal preference , parental control on , and the password .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with receiver in it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you could actually easily build in parental control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it would be more expensive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , and that way you could make cheap model and expensive model .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "could ma make the simple model and the deluxe model , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but t_v_s aren't capable of sending .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes they are .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they were just able to receive .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you yo , but most often not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have some t_v_s any .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that is true , that is true .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you cannot watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and there's just some little clock in the remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you could easily you could easily you could easily to the mote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just some rules .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you still have the problem about the television itself .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , it's very simple .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there i've seen some of remotes who have clock in it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , the remote does doesn't transmit when it's after twelve clock .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , on the t_v_ at least my t_v_ , is compartment which you can press .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and there are buttons behind it which you can use , if you don't if you don't have .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's to put it very blunt , that's not our problem .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just have the parents buy some glue and it's not part of the remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that is true .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that is true .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you could go like that would actually make things lot more easy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or make it ourselves very diffic .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you could just blame it on television and make it their problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "figured figure we could do that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm not what marketing thinks about it , but user profile .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have to consult my legal advisor about it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we have decided on the things that from janus , the energy , the combination between battery and kinetic .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the case will be double-curved and rubber , in fr flashy fruity colour that with cover is removable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the buttons will be touch-screen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but there may not be too many buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and in the menu structure , there must not to be five minutes to go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "too many levels .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it must be easy to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the parental control will be incorporated , but it must be not too complex .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the games are in it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we have decided , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have one thing left .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's handy to build in an expert view and simple view .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like moat or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what was thinking about is just menu structure , when you don't use it is simple .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like at in the experts view , you have lot of more buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you have that in the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and when you push system properties , entire list pops up with ev all you can program .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you use the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's already incorporated little in that concept .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you could actually build in function that you can program it yourself , for the more advanced users .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wh which buttons you like or not .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which buttons do you want to in it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text":

some bench-marker .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they're ha they're at , benchmarking , that's the word saw .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "couldn't , another thing is there were there was survey , and it came out that people like to buy things from single large provider , instead of those who are partnering with us .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , we must bring it as if real reaction is big

show somebody logo for point five seconds , they'll still remember it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it linger on every time you see it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the idea from this thing
