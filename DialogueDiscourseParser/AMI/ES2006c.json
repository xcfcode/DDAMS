[{"edus": [{"text": "so sent you the agenda , it was on the in the project documents .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you got chance to just have look at it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "anyway , it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the marketing expert has been watching .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you wanna start again ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let me we've got forty minutes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so haven't made powerpoint presentation , i'll use the whiteboard instead .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you haven't made powerpoint , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", so i'll start off by i'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that are or highlighting or underlining them like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's hope the pen holds out .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i'll start again with brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of remote control and then we can probably discuss the various components .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what you see here is so this is the outside of the remote , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you open it , you have circuit board here , and this is the chip that was talking about last time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this sends information to tr transistor here , which then sends the information to an l_e_d_ device here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you flip the printed circuit board , and this is the most important point here , everything else is , so if you flip the circuit board , this is what it looks like .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you see particular button attaches to particular place on the p_c_b_ and on pressing this button circuit completes , the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes out through there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the important point that read over the website was that the configurations of these printed circuit boards are quite cheap to make , you can ge get them printed as you want to , so we can have configuration irrespective of the cost , the way we want to have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's the important point here , so these are the different options that we have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the batteries , i'll start with the battery , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so they can be simple which is like the normal batteries in our the cells , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "thes these are the kind different batteries that the company makes , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does that mean like wind-up one ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if even if you want to consider this , but these are the different things that the company makes , so they'll since they'll come internally from the company , they'll be eas cheaper , all these options .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the third one is the kinetic energy ones .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching t_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and charging their remote , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and stop worrying about the whole r_s_i_ from the remote thing , 'cause that's just yay .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's good option .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what was this ka .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the kinetic energy one is that they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if it is good idea for remote control , because it'll just lie there for long while sometimes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for remote , 'cause you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it re recharges .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the fourth option is the solar cells , which are also made by the company .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what we think from everybody's perspective .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there are different cases that can be provided .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they can be the shape of the cases , they can be flat , they can be curved with one-sided curved and one side flat , and they can be curved with on both the sides .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "these are the three options , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would it be flat on both the sides , would be curved from one side , or whatever there were different supplements available , like it can be in plastic , rubber , wood , or titanium , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you mean this would be like the overall shape of the remote control , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "did you say wool ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wood , wood .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you'll understand why when we get to my presenta .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the so we can use even certain titanium is also used in the company to make some space design equipment , so it's it'll be probably nicer to use , because it relates to the overall image of the company , but it cannot be used on double curved surface .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we choose this , we cannot use titanium .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for these two we can use titanium , wood , rubber , or plastic .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the interface options now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can have push-buttons , like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push-buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can have scroll wheels like the ones on mouse pointers , something like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "sony ericsson mobile phones has it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , and they have they can even have an integrated push-button inside the scrolling thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the scroll plus push .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is something that has been recently developed by the company , in the last decade , so not too recent .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and l_c_d_s , we can have l_c_d_s .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so these two are recent and this is quite old .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the various electronic options are so this concerns firs first of all the chips showed you at so there's chip behind this one , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the p_c_b_ is inexpensive , so we can put in whatever we want , but the various integrated circuit options are , we have either simple one or regular or advanced .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the price goes up as we go down , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the good thing about wh why we would want to use advanced why we might want to use advanced is that l_c_d_s can only come with the advanced chip .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the we need regular or advanced for scroll wheels .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the chip includes the infra infrared sender .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "besides this in electr under electronics also the company has started making sample sender , which is did not explained what it was , but i'm guessing that so they have sample sender and sample speaker .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'm guessing that the sample speaker is probably something like , as soon as you press button , it give gives you feedback , one five or whatever .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and whether sample sender has to do something with voice recognition or not , but anyway .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , these are the different options that we have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's now that we can integrate , the user interface and the marketing things in that , keep taking out things from this and underlining things that are important , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you wanna stay somewhere near the board , so that if we need to you can sit down , but just we might need you to leap up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what are you , powerpoint , or .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have some powerpoint , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no it's got its little camera in there , plug it in .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it should do it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to be honest actually , mentioned some of the things which could fit on the this talk this time , mentioned them already in the previous talk .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , this time might not have them on the slides but just mention them aw again .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so would also include the definition of user interface so it's the aspects of computer system or programme which can be seen by the user and which the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this would includes things like shape and size and buttons and voice recognition as , and colour , and so on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the method employed this time was again having look to related products and mainly on the internet and then analyse them from the point of view of user fen friendliness and also whether their appearance was pleasant .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so some findings .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so in the case of many user interfaces , they're just so full of buttons that it's actually hard to find the ones you really want to use and it's just confusing , it takes know time to learn .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and would just quickly show some of them that found .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "some of them are here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the picture is not very clear , but as you can see , there are actu oi , for that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'s go back .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , they're quite big and have many buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "actually of the of all these personally prefer this one , because it's the smallest and with least with the smallest number of buttons as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and would say even the appearance of some of them is not so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so let's carry on with this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so other findings some new things used , some of them were mentioned already by our technical designer .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "our own company has developed new in user interface , no this is not the one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there is we can include voice recognition and it allows it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this one was already mentioned the l_c_ display .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "another new development is scroll button , which was also already mentioned .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and our own manufacturing division ha has designed new programmable speech speaker unit it's it should be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and this means that once it comes together with voice recognition , but it's once the gadget recognises the voice of the speaker , there can be pre-programmed answer , you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this is also one of the dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can you go back for second ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are you wha what this means , spinning wheel with the l_c_ display ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are , the ipod thing , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's like the like you said , no ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the scroll wheel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can't , it's like the ipod .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , the scroll button is different thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have picture if you just moment , i'll show you .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "wasn't completely myself , but it's just like it's wheel , it's like not separate buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "look , this one here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but i'm not really whether you can really turn it round , it's like you press this or .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , you can .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's the ipod alright , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's like where you how you have your mouse , and you go round and it's like that and you spin round and it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so instead of going down you just spin , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it is you just go round and it is bit weird at first , but it's actually very like fast .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like the wheels that click on the side you get much slower , so it's quite good if you like searching quite lot of .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do , if you're lookin if you're scrolling through the to of your music and you're looking at t_ , then it's lot faster than the wheel , but you've got lot less control over it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so should include that here as , l_c_d_s plus spinning .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the personal preferences are the same as last time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it has to be small , simple .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we decided to include voice recognition , so to have the standard major buttons like on , off , ch the channels and then volume and then the rest would be menu on the screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and also thought if we want to keep it small and actually quite like the idea of scroll scrolling button , it could be for voice like , it like on like it used to be on walkmans .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there is no reason why we couldn't use something like this for the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , that's it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "straight to trends , and then we can discuss it all at once .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've put the copy of the presentation in the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the project documents .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you two could both do that as , in case we need to refer to it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "here it comes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and what users are gonna be wanting in the near future .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now , the first aspect is twice as important as the second aspect , which is twice as important as the third aspect .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the which given the target group is what you would expect , really .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", people want something new , something technologically innovative and different , so the whole idea with the l_c_d_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like , quite the thing to go for .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , it wants to look fancy , fancy look and feel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so as you're discussing things , is it if we just keep highlighting things here ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it , so probably voice recognition is important , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's over on the interface , if you could put .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the and spinning so that means we need an advanced thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have point about , if it is the point to take it up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "l_c_d_s are for feedback , to the user who's pressing buttons , and the feedback can come through television itself , so do we need an on the remote ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "depends how fast your television runs , really , don't you think ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we've got one of those telewest boxes and you put the number in the remote and then you and then it goes to the t_v_ and then you , and then it comes , so it actually takes quite long time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if you get the number in wrong , then it's bit of pain , so , screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but like remotes do tend to get thrown about bit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it is also quite though to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen , so if you're watching something .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's true , that's also .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it would be like if you could make it integrate with the t_v_ then it could come up with new information about what's on , and you could just see that on the remote rather than .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but way to do it would be similar way to how you have your mobile phone , like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones and then the screen's protected so it doesn't actually get scratched .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can have like what looks like normal remote control , or like minimalist remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you got your buttons one to nine , your on and off and your volume on that and then if you want to mess about with it , you flip it open and , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then you can flip it open .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so now we seem to have consensus that l_c_d_s are definitely the way to go because of style and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that decides your whole chip thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so l_c_d_s , definitely .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "discovered clip art .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so these will be an important feature for clothes , shoes and furniture .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , i'm taking this to mean , curviness .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause you don't tend to get flat vegetables .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and possibly even uneven , like not symmet .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "bit of asymmetry and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that would be good way to get in the whole r_s_i_ issue in there , because if you think most people use the remote control with their hand ha hands so you wanna you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the hand .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm not quite about the relevance of material will be spongy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you have to suppose you wouldn't get remote an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "something bit squishy and , and it'd help if you drop it , it protects it as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have rubber , but there is problem that forgot to discuss with the with using so if we use latex cases , they won't allow us to use solar cells , as an energy source that is the constraint , so we could use titanium , wood or plastic or , energy source .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it could be like rubbery , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to some degree .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or if we want to use the latex , then we have to go with one of the other power things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there , you could just bounce it up and down .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "from bouncing it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "tap it on the desk , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can have it as like little ball to bounce , that flips open .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so probably double curved surface is the way to go , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or curved at one end and flat on the top , because i'm not if it is flat on both the sides , then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons , etcetera .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have to have certain element of flatness , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it depends on the whole ergonomics of it , it's like how you put your hands so it's the least movement .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much , does it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , don't makes lot of difference .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have one of those slidey phones and the back is essentially straight , but it's curvy , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "besides , you have four sides to thing , so does curved one side mean one side is straight and , curved two sides means the whole thing is just big curvy thing ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding because according to the information that have , the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "eith either we have flat surfaced case or curved surfaced case .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it does not say anything about whether technically , this is available .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "nothing to open them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's more about the protecting the , which is where it came from .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but no , my research didn't tell me anything , which is why we have all the pictures , 'cause had nothing better to do with my time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what've we got ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "combine style with level of functionality , beauty and practicality and thing of beauty and function .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "looking at what we've got , we want an display with spinning wheel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let's try to rub off things and , so hand dynamos are definitely out , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "rub off some of those .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you got wind dynamo , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not that's not streamlined and sexy , having wind up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "kinetic energy does seem to have some appeal , but it's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "tha depends how much movement it really needs .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's about the practicality of it really , isn't it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as against watch , which constantly keeps moving , this thing will have to be tapped every time , which might be very frustrating for the user .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if 't imagine wooden remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "kinetic energy it needs don't have too much technical information on that , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "pr presumably if they're suggesting it , then we could use it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let's keep it option keep an option , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'd keep it on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the flat co completely flat case is definitely out , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we don't want that it's no it's not vegetable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it has to be at least curved from one side , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we still have all the options .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wood , do you think wood will be good idea ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wood is 't how do you can't keep it really small you can't make it like thin and the wood thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because you need to you need to put all the technology in , so if the case you add the case and it becomes bit bulky wi .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it is really thin if it is really thin it it's likely to break , it's much more .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and given that we're looking at more spongy material preferences , ha would think rubber or plastic is more .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wood is not really .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "t's not very cleanable either , do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's not practical it's alright for table , but for remote control , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and splinters and it just doesn't make any sense , is the thing with wood .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wood is out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", in the case of remote control not really .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now for the really interesting , the interface .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the push-buttons is our expertise in the industry , but it seems to be out of trend , nobody seems to be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have to have some push-buttons , don't you ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you for the channel numb channel numbers you still need them , wouldn't you ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so for channel numbers but the display is , it's faster with and if we dis and when we discussed that we might like this flipping open thing , then you can use it as normal remote control , but if you do want to use , then you flip it open , but it's it it's more time-consuming .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we have displays , that opens up whole world , if you have an display , then you can select almost everything on the display .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just for fast .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is going back to the graph at the beginning that made , where , the buttons that people use all the time , you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it l_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so in the buttons we have for the channels also we have options .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or do we have just channel plus , channel minus , just to scroll ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , we definitely need the numbers , because it's otherwise people don't want to flip through all the channels .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would say buttons , because it's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or on the we can , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would think buttons , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's the thing is , so if someone just wants to turn on their t_v_ and put on channel , then it should be easier to use than any other remote , and then if someone wants to , change the contrast on their t_v_ and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible , but , most of the time there's limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the t_v_ , is the issue there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so buttons definitely in but shall we try to draw prec .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's what you are gonna do next , so if we put down the key things that we want .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", so the components .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what about the scrolling ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but i'm not completely clear , about the spinning wheel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it doesn't make sense to have both like scrolling and spinning thing , it's you can al include everything in the spinning if you , in that case .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just spinning and not scrolling , would say .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would say the spinning goes at high speed to the scrolling wheel , so you have to decide whether you , you want to be going so fast or not .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the thing with this whole if you're planning on making it out of rubber , on the basis that it's spongy , then i'm not how scrolling wheel would work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm not it'll be good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if you've got if you've got flipped thing , effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side , but you folded it in half .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you can , so too , the case would be the case would be rubber and the buttons , rubber buttons , but then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but your spinning wheel tends to go to one side .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would be on one side , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it or at the corners , edges , just the edges covered by rubber like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , it's just the casing rubber on the outside .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you want an outside of rubber and then open it up and or like interchangeable cases .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause know like we're going back to ipods again the whole spinning wheel , but have like , my ipod's not made of rubber , but then have little rubber case that goes over the top of it and change the colour , theoretically , to match my outfit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", so that gives us more trendy look as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the spinning wheel is definitely very now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's what they're after .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i'll rub that out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and colours can be provided with the case rather than but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such , just keep it black , or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we it was requirement that we use our the colours of our company , so would it be like yellow , grey and black , or , does .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "banana's yellow , definitely .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote the colour like vegetable colours , do ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you could have like suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and purple and that and then you'd pick the buttons in company colours to match with it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you go over to the integrated circuits .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "since we're having l_c_d_s there there's no way that we're will be able to what we do need to consider , however , is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering , but since l_c_d_s seems to be definite yes , so it seems to be one area where we would want to spend .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we need the advanced .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i'll rub off the other two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so are we discounting solar energy because rubber's gonna be used in there somewhere or if solar panels with the rubber .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that was the we can't have solar panels with rubber , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is the constraint was .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we'll have using the simple battery will be safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one , although it does seem interesting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", so we lose that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "shall we go for if we're going for rubber , we think on as our case , and then .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the buttons as , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we've got five more minutes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it does not hold any advantages as such for .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's just gimmick .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we understand this better now that the speaker is for the feedback , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it says the things that you type in like that , so ye , we don't have too much information about it , so this is in as then , the sample speaker .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost , then i'd put them in , but if it's .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it should be quite cheap because it's from our own company , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's from the company , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the case is curved on one side , but then flat , so it's flipped into each other .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "flat on the top .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can pull the thing out the back of your computer ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", do you want me to what does i_c_s_ mean ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just so we can nothing , it's , i'm just there we go .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's advanced integrated circuits ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now i've gone too far .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as l_c_d_s , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're on our way .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we've worked out that we're going with simple battery , the advanced chip and curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , made out of rubber and the buttons are also rubber .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an with spinning wheel , and we're incorporating voice recognition .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's our overall concept , and it's gonna look vegetable , and be in bright vegetable colours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so would with have the spinning wheel inside with the , or would it be on the outer .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's on the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "imagine it would be inside .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so actually that could like really cut down your thing , so you've got your outside , which is like minimalist , and then you open it up and you've got screen and spinning wheel , which you can incorporate buttons into .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you've still not got like lot of in the you've got , like if you're modelling on ipod you've got five buttons and wheel , and four of the buttons are in the wheel , and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in the centre , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in the meantime , the industrial designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design , which i'll presume he'll work out what that means .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the user interface designer will work on the user interface design and the marketing expert is going to work on product evaluation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and as that , the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and anyone who hasn't put their presentation in the project documents folder , it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm gonna go and sit on my own .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "nobody wants to talk to you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "know , i'm hated .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i've got bit tangled up in all this .", "speaker":
