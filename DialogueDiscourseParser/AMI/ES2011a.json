"A"}, {"text": "so our aim is to produce remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and to do this , we have to there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll get to that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there it is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "functional design , conceptual design and detailed design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so throughout our next couple of meetings we'll be covering these things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're gonna try out our white board .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we'll all draw our favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you want us to draw it and then talk about it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or just draw it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "why don't we do both .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we ought to decide who starts and all that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "does anyone they wanna draw ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "gotta think about it for second like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "does it have to be functional ,

do you like about your animal ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like its tail .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , dolphins are really , they're smart and they they're cute and they like swimming and that's , like they're graceful , and they're so they're sleek and they look intelligent and , they're it's the whole like binocular vision thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how intelligent that one looks .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "he doesn't look that smart .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "he's they're it's the interaction that or the things that the reasons people seem to like you get ex people are sitting on the beach and they're like look there's dolphins and it's kinda like but they're they jump around in the water and they're happy and they're mammals , but they swim .",

"A"}, {"text": "they sleep all day , they're easy to draw .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you wanna anything ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "had the cat as , but i've got spare one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the pen is running out of two million .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so i'll use the spare one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's harder to draw .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the pen's dying .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't really know how the legs go , but anyway will do that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's very good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the main reason is they're pretty .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they're very pretty and they go with the environment , and like the way they run and used to do horse riding and they're just very sturdy and animals .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and like the way they feel , under the hand , that's it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how many should we sell then ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "actually haven't thought of anything yet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'm thinking we should design remote control that's water resistant , strong and furry .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what do you think , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is , like cat , soft .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "textile tactile , tactile remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "although i'll just put there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you're dragging you have tail .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "my gosh , this is disastrous .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so moving on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our selling price goal is twenty five euro and profit aim is fifty million euro .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'm guessing that we're not actually in scotland , we're in some european country .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we will hope to sell this internationally .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can you just say that what's the what are our price goals again ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "selling price is twenty five euro .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "profit aim fifty million euro .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "lot , two million , two mi no , more four million .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it t's the profit so if profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it is lot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's fifty percent .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what these mean because didn't actually make the slide-show .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "experience with remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what we would like to see in convenient , practical , remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so do we have any initial ideas for how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the buttons it should have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one thing is that it should be easy to find bec , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was thinking that too .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should design something that has like so you can like somehow like you always know where your t_v_ is , so just have call button , i've always wanted that , so like you can push button on your t_v_ , so you should have call button on your television to be able to find your remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have it for the portable phone , so why not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and even little light .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or even vib vibrating thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but someth because it's usually under the sofa .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in which case you're going to be but if it has signal which isn't any sound if it's expensive to call is enough .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't it but like just like your phone even just has so like it can vibrate , it can light up and make noise and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what if it had something like just like magnet on the back of it and you could just to have some place to put it besides like base .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like portable phone has base , like just to have home for it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or if it had .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause people just stick it on top of their t_v_ , but the point of having remote is not to have to walk over to the t_v_ , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's why it's always in the couch .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in the couch .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it seems like though that would be hard , 'cause you not you're not gonna be lazy anyway and so we the project is now couches and remote controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but even just thing to attach it to the if you had thing , pretty object attached to the wall .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that would really make it more expensive .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's only plastic thing , really , the thing on the wall .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "something like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the other thing is not needs to be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you needs to be bigger to not lose , or does that not factor in ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like hand held size , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't think you need but definitely not .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not huge , but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it can't be that hard to put some noise on it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , it can't be , uh-uh .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no it really wouldn't be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or like light thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or make it mobile so it runs around and comes come find you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that would be really i'm we could do that for twenty five euros pop .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "little homing device .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what do we think this remote control should five minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "till the meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is what we have left .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons , 'cause hate that when they have too many buttons and has to have enough functions but like , you , just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like , no , you never use half of them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "button and the button , they don't do anything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you what if may be little fancy but what if it had like little screen , so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like the way mobile phone does .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it just seems like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you could like if you have if you have satellite if you have hundred channels , you can the way you do it on your radio is that you what do you call it but you can programme , so you can programme like your favourite channels , so like if you had that's something we could decide .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they would go together somehow ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because , if it's expensive , if you have if you use the telly screen , 'cause the telly's already screen , then you can pro have programming function , really easy arrow up and down , on the remote , and then use the telly as screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm thinking or like you see those people i'm thinking of like celebrity cribs things when like they have all those these things that at their house their entire house is so electronic , and they have like this one master control that and it's like hand held like turns on everything control and it has like screen and like so it should be possible to have some screen , if it must be it would probably must be ex too expensive though like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "something like not it's not on the button but it's telling you what to do , is that what you mean ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have to remember our budget is twelve point twelve fifty for to actually make the device .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it's something to think about , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to get to that later , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we'll have to see how much that would be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or some it we can find out probably on the internet how much it's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water what was the word ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no but it's , spot on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "good feel , tact tactile , good tactile feel , something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's quite annoying .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just like simple thing to have clip on it , like so you can clip it to your like that's another .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we should probably start wrapping up , we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and come up with some new ones for the next meeting , which will be in another thirty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the industrial designer , what does that stand for , i_d_ , is going to be looking more into the working design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and that thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the something , what is the u_i_ ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what does it stand for again ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "user interface design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "user interface designer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's gonna be more technical .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so technical function .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the working design is the structure .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what is technical functions exactl don't really it does but it don't really .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you'd have to find out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it says on that email but it said like be medium between you and the telly , that's marketing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it was in the email .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wrote down what mine were .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what effect should the thing ha should it have , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and working design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and how it works , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm on task .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the m_e_ , what does that stand for ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's written here , but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we'll be working on the user requirements , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that wraps it up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll see you
