your turn .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "isn't it amazing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , let's talk about the interface concept .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "first i'll discuss the buttons we just chose , show you some samples , discuss some colours and design , already .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and my personal preferences .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "chose the power button to switch the television on and off .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the bu the mute button to switch the volume on and off .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the channels buttons , one to nine , and off zero to nine , and the button to choose higher channels than nine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the volume and channel quadrants , left and , up and down arrows , to do the volume and channel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the menu button to man manipulate the display .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "found some interesting samples .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what's pretty standard is that it's that they're all pretty high .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "lot of buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "large and pretty thin and long .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "power buttons are mostly at the top left or .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "see the same arrows .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , arrow buttons can be blue .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and what's interesting is the icons on the buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we don't use that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , these we have to choose the icons , or letters .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is the v_ for volume , but they're both v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's not really very clear what's the function of that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , that's , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can you go back one page ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for the menu , what do we use for that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we don't have buttons for the menu .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that was our idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , how like this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you have to put it on the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that the menu button is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the icons on the arrows , as , you mean .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the second one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's something to think about .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll have something in my presentation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you will see it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't if we have to discuss this already , or in the next meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , as we have to design the case and the whole remote control in our corporate company colours and the logo , would recommend yellow case .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the logo at the bottom .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , each set of buttons has his own colour .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , it's good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not too much colours .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not too much .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but no , no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , it's not flower power .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but this has to be has to be trendy and , so good icons on the buttons , and big buttons is my personal opinion .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that was that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , you're next .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm next , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "here we go .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "at first we will say something about what younger people want , our group we want to sell our remote controls to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then , i'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about what battery is in it , what buttons also .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "first , the younger people , they want like soft mat materials and primary colours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like , yellow , red .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's visible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the shapes are curved and round , like you also said .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's to get remote control not like all the other ones , straight and flat and long .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but to give him the shape of your hand , so you it's easier to use like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that's just an idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then , i'll have to discuss about the costs of all the things for the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the battery , there are few options .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the best option is to use the basic battery .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , everybody can buy it at the supermarket .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or use kinetic battery like within watch .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when you shake it few times , it it's loaded .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the form of the remote control , it's also have it curved .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and like it's hand-shaped .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "material , you use plastic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "hard plastic because it won't have to burst like in the in one time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also rubber because the younger people like that , what we see in the research .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have one new thing discovered .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's scroll push thing like mouse .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's easy to use for the channels .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when you want to go move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wanna see the next , if you wanna see that channel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also for the mouse , for the volume , it's also easy to use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just scroll bit up , scroll bit down .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that's also easy just when you have thing like this , and you get it here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can do it with your thumb .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and with your left hand you can push the buttons if you push channel one , you can see channel one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the electrics with scroll push button , we must use regular chips .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are also simple chips .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they are cheaper .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then we have just basic remote control , and there are lot of those things , and people won't buy it any more .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they have seen enough of it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you have also advanced chips .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that's with the screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the costs will increase lot more .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and our budget is too low to use and an , and the chip who is more expensive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it's also then thoughtful if we use as different shapes for the for remote control , that we then use the primary colours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like , you get yellow remote control , red one , blue one , et cetera .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have any more questions about this ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the main thing is we look at the costs .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and not too basic , not basic remote control , who everybody already has .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , thi this is with an ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , not .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not with an .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , isn't .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the is easy when you use the scroll buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then , what say , the costs will get lot higher .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then it's not easy to use scroll wheel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then you'll see it on the television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you don't , yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then you go one down one up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when you scroll .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but when you see menu on the television , it's like you see one to twenty , you go scroll up , and push number tw twenty .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but like we said before , it has to be used on every television .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you may not be no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the television must do that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so but young people have to have all their room .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the younger people will have newer televisions , which can provide our remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and mostly they are smaller .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so most the times that are not advanced televisions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that won't be problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , but then we'll get to the regular remote controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , what said , everybody has them already .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they go to supermarket and buy them for two euros .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and ge and get the most cheapest thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we must look further to devel develop something news .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can you give an indication in the cost difference between the chip with or without ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "got it on my screen and it was higher .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but how much higher .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause it if we have an , it will also sell lot better .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that might bring back the costs .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but then we'll we must discuss who what will be better .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we have better shape of the remote control , or better options on it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "with scroll menu , scroll thing , and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then flat remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or , more hand-shaped remote control , with scroll , without .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can look how much it is for the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "look on my note that the push-button requires simple chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's very important .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "scroll wheel requires minimally regular chip , which is higher price range .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the display requires advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but how much ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's from my manufacturing division .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , my presentation is about trend-watching .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "did some trend-watching .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's very important to keep up with latest trends .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause if you don't , you won't sell .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , how we did do that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "made an investigation of the market , by trendwatchers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they watch in cities like paris and milan .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "known for their trend trends .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , what did you find ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the young and trendy , they starting to like fruit and vegetables as theme for clothes , shoes , and also products .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , material ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that should feel have spongy feeling .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and to get feeling for what it is , here is an image of it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then the old and rich .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they like dark colours , and simple , recognisable shapes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , they also like familiar material , especially wood .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now , another picture .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to get feeling for this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then already come to my personal preferences .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we aim at the younger market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , we should also be look at their trends .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "however , with trends it's always if there's it's now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it might last one year , and next year it be can be different .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we want to sell our product for longer than one year .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , we must not just only look at what the trend is now , as it might be different next year .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , that's one thing to keep in mind .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so now , it's , let's see .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now , we have to decide , we have to decide on the concept .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , we have to look at 's next .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "components and user interface concept .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so now , we have to make some concept .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one of you can paint it on the board .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first , user interface .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how we make it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "shouldn't we first discuss about like what we all , but if paint with more like something like 't dr 't draw it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , concept on just , but we can paint it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what do we want ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "something like this ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or shapes or what do we need ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can make several concepts .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have this , and we had the idea of an more like sh in the shape of your hand .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and you have to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm not designer .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's more three d_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like , when you have part here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then you have something like this under it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , it's easier to get it like this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's like gun .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , it has to be soft ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it has to be soft , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , you can squeeze in it and ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , the buttons ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "buttons on top of it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can do it with your thumb .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that's the only scroll button on it then ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but now we use one scroll button and the other one is here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , it won't .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one till zero till nine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , there one for the sound and one for the channels .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or two buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if we go to but if we have me .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "two scroll wheels .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we do if we use one , then we'll have just switch on it , and you'll just switch it , and now it's the sound to switch back with the menu button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's more difficult .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's better in but if we don't have we don't have menu .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we have menu , how do we choose other options ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then you also can scroll in it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just not like all the other ones , with this thing , and here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because , from hundred remote controls , ninety nine have it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then we have it on the t_v_ , the menu .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but again how do we know the t_v_ can handle it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , there's no menu .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's like some teletext option , but we don't have teletext .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you can't use it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if we put an thing on it , then the costs will be much higher .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we make two concepts .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you all like this thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "with the scroll button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that's one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and this one has to be soft .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and this has to be harder , because when it falls , it mu must not burst .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or some rubber around it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you can and you can make the power button as trigger .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like just to , like .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but when you handle it , you put it on and off .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not good to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but i'll zap .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , it's not good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now , second concept .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one with , one without .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then paint it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with the scroll thing on , like this ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one with two scroll buttons and one with without .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one with menu , and one without menu .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the one with menu has an .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do have to do everything .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have not so difficult .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if you put push the menu button , wh what yes , but you which of the scroll buttons you have to choose .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the menu .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there for the screen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have to for the menu .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one that way .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and one that way .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so then it depends on the cost .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "on and off .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but is it easy to use ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when you have it on your left side , and separate , more separate , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when it's not too big .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just like phone .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's better if the scroll-wheels are more separate , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like , you have the menu button in between .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "on the left scroll button , and on the scroll button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but would it be easy to use then ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it's like you have big also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is it better ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when you the menu , you have to go there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they were like round curves , different , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the outside .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but now the first the buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "think we have now two buttons missing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the mute button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have two buttons missing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the mute button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , the to have to numbers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the other .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not so difficult .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "personally , two scroll buttons aren't easy to handle .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but how do you wanna solve it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with the switch button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but on the menu that's not easy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then you go down , you switch , you go into the , you switch , you go down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no like , you mean like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then you can also have like , and joystick , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but is it does that break , joystick ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or small one just like in laptop .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like in laptop , some thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "little bit bigger , with easier thi .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "mean , it's better .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but how expensive it is ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "why do pay you for ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or no scroll things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and no , no .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for the young peoples scroll button's good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it won't work .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so think we have to keep them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or remote control more like joystick .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but is it that's not expensive than joystick is better .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "small one like this , like nintendo playstation thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no just like in laptop .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "small , round .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then it's not so big .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the shape of the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the sh , but then you can you have to use with one hand .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just like playstation thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , if it's possible , it's not too expensive , joystick is better .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , look at it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , that's , got they're not in details .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and on the , how much it costs ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it costs extra ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's more expensive or less expensive , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we you get it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , after this meeting you have half an hour to fix it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then have to come with it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "got my personal costs .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't the costs .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then i'll make something up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , do we have other concepts ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then for the components , we use normal battery .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then it's ch cheapest way , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or the kinetic with normal battery .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , no kinetic .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's , more expensive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "kinetic is ch makes it more expensive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we use normal battery .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "depends on the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "depends on the scroll .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we use scroll , then we have the regular chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we don't use scroll , then we can use the simple chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that's the most expensive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , we if you use the , we have to yes , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , depends on the and the scroll .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we no scroll-wheel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , have this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , it will be the advanced chip , or the regu or the regular chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , the shapes of the design depends on the and but , it has to be small .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then just put also on it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you have pistol , it l_c_d_'s not easy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if you use phone .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just use your thumb .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "use my thumb .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then you have it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like , if you have pistol , you have it so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the screen is , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you have joystick on no , if you have like an ni playstation game controller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you move up , forward , down , left .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then you have just , little bit curved .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's not just straight .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's how we use it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's why they make joysticks like that , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then you look forward .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then you can , if you have to look at it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you if we have then something standing here , with the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "here's our designer .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then it goes like this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if yes , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's for the younger people .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's something new .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's or you can turn it inside .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the , it may not break .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now we put rubber around it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if that's possible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "hard plastic , the shape , and around it hard around it rubber .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the hand shape is also rubber .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'t see the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , the easy of , the ease of use wasn't the most important aspect of it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that's no , that's true .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for us it's about to sell it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is something new .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then this is the design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the buttons are on the next page
