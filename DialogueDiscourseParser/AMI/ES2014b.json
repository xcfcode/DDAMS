[{"edus": [{"text": "so where's the powerpoint presentation ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "microsoft powerpoint , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we've got so we've got new project requirements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to for this meeting to discuss the various options .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have presentation each , 'cause i've got one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i've got one too .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's to know , one from each of you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "new project requirements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so do we want to do the presentation first , or do we want to got or three things , relating to the remote being only for t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we discussed that last time and in actual fact that was pr pretty what we came up with anyway .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it actually we won't be forestalled in sense .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've got teletext outdated .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did you get any information on that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we didn't , no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the corporate image was the final thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so got that in email form .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if we go ahead with the three presentations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we'll start with yourself on the basis that , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll just i'll grab the wire out the back of this one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what is it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm not quite how it control doesn't seem to be quite working at the moment .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you've got to do control eight .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "alt function eight .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "again not doing anything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's usually little thing in the top for the hang on , it's just coming on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there , it's doing something .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "pressed about five times now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have to go again .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "hopefully that should be it this time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm gonna be looking at the working design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "of the remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i've just got three sections , first is the research made on the remote control itself .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then that involves the components required in it and the systems design of the actual remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so having researched the existing models within the market , found my research off the internet .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i've established what the components required for the remote control to function , actually are .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do and how it connects with the television .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the basic components are an energy source which in most existing models would be battery supply .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "whether that'll be two batteries , four batteries , it may vary .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we then have the user interface , which is the like the buttons on the actual remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the various functions used for changing channel , channel up and down , volume , things like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's also chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then the sender , which is usually , i've found , an infra-red device which sends signal to the actual television .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the last part is receiver which is important in the system but is not actually part of the remote itself , because that's found in the television .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm gonna have to actually draw on the board because it was little tricky on powerpoint to get this working , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll just go through there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do we have cloth to wipe this down with , or ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's that little .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's the rubber on the , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll get rid of the bear that's .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we start off with battery suppl no , power supply which we'd probably get it's probably gonna be the battery .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we then have particular button , which may be that's there's lots and lots of different buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but this is how the basic system works .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that sends after you press that sends the message to the chip , which then sends it interprets which button you've pressed and then sends the appropriate message to the sender .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the remote in itself , that's the components of the remote and how they work together .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is the user interface .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is the chip itself , which then , and that's the infra-red sender .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then on the separate thing we have on the television we have receiver .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the sender sends message to the receiver .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the top bit's the power source , yes ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , that's the power source .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "going on to personal preferences , i've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote , just because of the size .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you don't want cable attached to the remote otherwise it's not really remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then the sender , and infra-red has been used quite successfully .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if the battery's on reasonable power , they always seem to work fairly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you don't have to be point directly at the television itself .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the battery is the in the sender .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's it for the moment .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , now more design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "mine's not quite as complicated as all that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's what we like to hear .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did press function ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is it control function ei , there you go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'm gonna talk bit about the technical functions design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm louisa , the user interface designer , as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the basic method of this is to send signal from the remote to the television set , so that desired function is performed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down , so you need two different buttons for that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to change the channel , either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to switch the television on or off , standby button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "here are two example remotes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "by the look of it they both have play and fast forward , rewind functions , so they incorporate video function which we won't have to worry about .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but as you can see , the left remote is quite busy looking , quite complicated .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "whereas the remote is much simpler , it looks much more user friendly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so my personal preference would be the remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , it's got big buttons , it's got very limited number of buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they're , kinda clearly labelled .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like the use of the symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as the words on the play functions and all that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's very user friendly , and it's got little splash of colour .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "could do with some more colour .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's couple of things there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to remember that we have our own logo and colour scheme .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we'd have to we'd have to be putting that on the product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do we get to see that ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "will you be presenting that in bit ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "haven't as yet , no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but got an email that said to make that whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate the corporate colour and slogan .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'm guessing that notice on the bottom there it's got what's that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "a_p_o_g_e_e_ that might be the corporate colour scheme , although the only colour see in that is the red .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would you be able to get rid of the extra buttons here , the circular section , because that seems to be for video as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we could dispense with that little bit as and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what do you mean by the circular section ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like all of that bottom bit ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just this little bit is that that's still video remote part , so we could get rid of that as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and don't really think that you need nine numbers .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the on the for general television purposes you have channels one to five at this point in time , and we'd have to have some room for future such channels .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how often do you use seven , eight and nine ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like how often do you hit nine ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's just people are used to seeing that , so if we didn't have them then they might t's .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , possibly but the other thing is that with the current expansion of channels in the process of taking place , certainly the button up and down , but how many channels do we have to actual television channels do we have to prepare for ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would have thought that it's forever expanding and at the moment we've got although you've onl you've got the five standard , you've got the b_b_c_ have come up with further six and there's exactly how many channels there are on when you take into account sky and various other various others .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so would've thought that we wouldn't , rather , if the time of flicking from one to other , but presumably it'll take second 'cause you have to be able to stop it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you could have fast forward on the channels that and then you could dispense with more otherwise .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you'd want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "some remotes have favourite options where if you always flick from channel one to channel six , if that's favourite you just like by-pass two to five .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "suppose in sense you could have if you've got hundred channels then if you had an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to hundred , you could go one to ten , ten to twenty and then have second button to get you to the actual channel you want and that would cut down your time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but lot of like cable and sky and , that would be tuned to one channel , and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "limit the number of buttons , user friendly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but suppose nine's not really excessive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "suppose with nine you've got the like the last one which makes the tenth means you it's like multiples you can put them together so you can make any number .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "suppose it does make good pattern .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so with that we'd by-pass any problems with .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's true , you could get fifty by five and zero or whatever , that makes sense .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what was the circular thing that you were if it's just for t_v_ , which is what it is at the moment .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's just for video , so we wouldn't need any of that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we could get it down to what ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we get to how many buttons have we got ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we've just got ten , eleven twelve we got fourteen that we need .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which isn't really too many .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that'll be quite easy to make user guide for fourteen button remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'ve we've got that it's remote for t_v_ only otherwise project would become too complex with which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm did you have that information behind the marketing , or was to give you that information ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "had i've had some market information , but not from the company , no .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", so time to market seems to be important , therefore speed of delivery .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've only got about another four hours left .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so is everyone happy with that ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , that seems good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the end of my presentation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm gonna pull this off .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you just give it second to catch up .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "she said twenty seconds to what was that last wee bit there ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm we'll have by the end of today .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll give it another go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and first off we should state that the remote control's for controlling the t_v_ and how do people use it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we asked them which buttons were useful for them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how does remote control look and feel for them , and what improvements would they like to remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we did that by giving them questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that even higher proportion would spend more for fancier remote control and that of all the buttons on the remote control , the setting buttons for the picture and brightness and the audio settings , they weren't used very often .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "people concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we also asked them about speech recognition for remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and young people were quite receptive to this , but as soon as we got over about into thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older , people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there's lot more there's lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the second biggest frustration what that if they got new remote control , it was difficult to learn all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so my personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sleek good looking high high-tech design which looks high-tech , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , and we should concentrate on the channels and power , and also volume and that thing , as louisa said .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could come up with menu , an menu for other functions on the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's worth thinking about .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we could think about speech recognition as , because young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy our new product if we aim it at high-tech design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that might be the market that we're looking for .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we could think about using speech recogniti recognition as way to find the remote control if it's lost in room , rather than having it to speech recognition to change the channels .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause there's problem with that in that the television makes noise , so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that's the end of the slide show .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do lot of there's key rings that you whistle at or clap at , 't remember , and then they whistle back , like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "about speech recognition ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "speech recognition , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that was only for young people that preferred it , older people didn't .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "youn young people pref , they said that they'd be interested in remote control which offered that possibility and as you go up through the age groups , people got less and less interested in remote control that you could talk to , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no what it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for the speech recognition .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and possibly the thing about the remote being lost we could have with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can have some sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some buzzer system between the two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can press button which is always kept in one place and then it buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we'd have that would mean we'd have to put two products together as , which again would probably be bit expensive , but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that is true , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that'd probably be really simple , they're cheap .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it'd be something we could like attach to the or like the same technology could be put inside the remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you're trying to avoid having second product 'cause you could have second product that gave you the pitch which would set the remote off to say here am thing , without sound recognition .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if you know .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was gonna say sharp noise , clapping of hand or whatever .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you'd want to try and av just have the one product that if .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one device .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "talking about vo if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way because it'll recognise the voice and you can give it command , set command whatever that happened to be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you've then got the point if you're not going with voice recognition then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you could have an option to turn it off .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or perhaps , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that would solve the problems with the t_v_ speaking to the remote and changing its own channels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so any sugges , any conclusions ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would it take quite while to develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it does then we can't .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's that simple , because we've got three primary requisites from and email that was sent to me whereby we had the design logo was one , which we've already mentioned .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've got the remote was only for the television and not for because that would make it too complex and we have to get it market quickly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the third thing was that teletext as far as the management is concerned , is becoming dated due to the popularity of the internet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that means that so these are the three extra parameters that have been put on this project .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're being focused effectively directly at television and it seems to me that the management is wanting us to go down narrow path and not opening out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so anything that is to be added , such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick because time to market is critical .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "has to be simple enough to suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "added extras would be , but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within this short time window , which effectively now is four hours .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so and if and we've gotta get to the end .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with added extras if possible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so about five minutes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so need to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so how long we have left of our time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we have to make the decisions on the remote control functions and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next meeting each person that's got task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll also know when the next meeting is so we'll know how long we've got to complete that task .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we can report back at the next meeting and say yes , we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this , this is how far we've progressed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does that make reasonable sense ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes that seems .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote functions so that you can decide what you're gonna be doing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting , if you get any additional information that only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making process , then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not until the next meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do it via the email so that rather than coming if you get the information just before the next meeting that's fine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "come along with it in the next meeting , we can discuss it then and take whatever action is appropriate .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if you get it before the next meeting , let everybody else know 'cause that might have an impact on their on what they come up with effectively at the next meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is there would so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so do we need to decide on the functions now ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it'd be really easy and it'd be big advantage if we did have some whistle back function .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that was the number one frustration that people said , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause that'll solve the frustration of losing it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't think there's anything else on the market that does that , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't really know about the voice recognition thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment , and if something comes back i'd go more , more for clap .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if our primary consideration is to get it there in time , time's short , you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have that as selling point for the product , something that's quick and simple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , sounds good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that wouldn't put off the older generation either , 'cause everyone can whistle or clap , and they wouldn't have to be scared of this new technology .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so clap rather than whistle would be on the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range , you want something that's easy to do , now something that doesn't like whis .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no not everyone can whistle , can they , though ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you think that more people can whistle than clap then that's fine , then go for that option , but if would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle , so clap option .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , clapping , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we've already decided that we don't need teletext button , haven't we ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is that one of the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ef effectively that's what the that's what they're saying , that if people are now using the internet then you don't need teletext , so take out teletext .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "taking out teletext , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "did we decide on having the ten numbers and then the little digit next to it which enabled you to put them together .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , so zero to nine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you second or two to press another number , so you can press any two and it'll put them together .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ten numbers and then some device to allow i'll put delay to allow multiple numbers .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or multiple digits .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "did we decide anything about the other functions ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as in setting the audio and tuning it and like that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you had an idea about the menu ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could possibly put an l_ menu in , but that again is probably an expense that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but just thinking people probably you don't have you only have to probably tune in the t_v_ once , but you have to be able to tune it that once .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so and if finally the t_v_ breaks , you get new one , you're gonna have to be able to tune it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can't really avoid that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "except the new digital markets which do it by themselves .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that'll be in yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the but that's relying on the television market changing to an automatic and if it is at the moment , that's fine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but at the moment it's not , so it seems to me that you have to have device that caters , 'cause otherwise it would make it your device would become inoperable , or only operable in certain circumstances and the idea is to have an international market which is and it's also it's the product we've got is something that's at the would have said the lower end of the cost scale , so we're not really going that's terribly high-tech .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "suppose if people are buying remotes , then they're probably buying it to replace another remote 'cause all most tellies come with remotes , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions , so we need to keep the tuning function in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so how would this menu function work ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would you have like one menu button , then you'd use the other buttons , the number buttons to actually do the separate functions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would be good idea , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like the volume .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause you do need brightness and contrast and everything as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "my dad was watching film the other week and it was too dark , so had to go through it and turn the brightness up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we're gonna have the individual numbers and then menu function and slightly more advanced instruction booklet to come with it , to guide presu it'd be quite hard just for people to grasp just off like the menu use different buttons you have to have like some better instructions of how that would actually work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm not whether the having people have booklet 'cause one the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so next to each of the buttons , each of them could have number and then also function written next to it , so you're pressing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that also goes back to the original design when we saw those two , and there was the one on the left hand side which had all like the double functions and which looked too busy and had too much on it , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as , have you seen those remotes where the bottom bit slides down , so there's everything else revealed ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's very good idea .", "speaker":
