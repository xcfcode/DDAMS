"you can start .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "cable , camera .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have powerpoint ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should be in my in their folder no ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "who are you ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we have technical problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do we think in the wrong folder ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it is possible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you put it on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it was somewhere in something like this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't remember the name actually must be something like messenger ami .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what do you have in short cut ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have no over .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there is nothing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's no we have technical problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's go and check .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll go and check .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "otherwise , could you just describe by hand ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "with the whiteboard ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you remember but that's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what we want here is remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the question first of all what to control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so most people want to have remote for their hi-fi and t_v_ and like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and but other people want also remotes for controlling and toys like robotic pets and little robots and other people also want to have remotes for controlling whole house .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so there's project called x_ house like that does that , you can integrate your remote with computers .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so there is one that is one thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the other is the finder feature by whistling or whatever .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you have the finder feature then you can also have at the same time as and general voice commands if you want .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it should be package in that case .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the user interface will consist of two parts .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the buttons part would be set of buttons for choosing devices , set of buttons for special navigation in space , set of buttons for linear access of medium and set of buttons for random access .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what do you mean by linear access then ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like video tape goes forward , backwards , fast and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so special navigation , linear access , random access and there's fourth one no ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the better now for special navigation ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for special navigation you might have t_v_ in the menu and you going to change ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then linear access then random access .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and also parameter changing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if there are common parameters we should put special buttons for that or

.", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you can open the is not here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can it's messenger no ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in which folder ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text":

switch slides when you whenever you ask , that will be more convenient .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , functional requirements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you can go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects and the subjects also filled questionnaire ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and here have the results so you can see that seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly so we have to find something to make them more , more kind .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look to it's not good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's not in theory but say .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can just keep doing that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "fifty seventy five per cent of users say they zap lot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we have to have remote control very out for that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the buttons have are to be like you say resist resisting to shocks .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and fifty per cents of users say they only use ten per cents of but of the buttons in the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so all the buttons we have to put are have to have use real use and not only or .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so fewer buttons would be good ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not many buttons , and useable buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but what remote controls did you look at ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what task was it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it was t_v_ ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "most for most is t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we it seems that we are going to make t_v_ remote control according to new requirements received from the management bo will present them in the following .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can go so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so there are other frustrations expressed by users , so they said they lost often the remote control in the room so they want to have way to find it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to find it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and lot of the time they it takes too much time to learn how to use new remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so they want something really very simple and easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and remote controls are bad for r_s_i_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what is her other side ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "other side , yo wa your wrist .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it become painful you can have tendonditis .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "did not knew that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you also up on computer in strange position .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you we have to make it more ergonomic .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have to say ha .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's your job .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "got message from microsoft .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "before that have some thing to say before we know that the user use lot their remote control to change channel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and to change volume selection of the and not lot for setting the channels and thing things like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's better to put something very easy to set and very accessible yes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this function should be very accessible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is the main function .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so then we asked some questions to them and we asked this question if they prefer an screen or on their remultific function remotes control and if they pay more for speech recognition in remote control and you can go we have here the results of the questions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the first question .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that for the younger it's very important to have the yes and speech recognition .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to have and voice .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the others is not so important but we know that people between fifteen and twenty five are people who watch lot t_v_ and who wh can use lot this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we can have speech recognition in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is important .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "moreover those like those teenager customer could advice their parents to buy this equipment and so we can we have to take care of that point of view or so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if there is the conclusion now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so as we say before , remote control lightening in the dark it's good thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not to many mud buttons like we said before , easy to use way to find it easily in the room and resistant to shock and to an no , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these are the user requi .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you see something else important or .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm just thinking of some thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we want to have no , if this is good idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we want to have general remote control for everything .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we it seems that we no want to have t_v_ remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "from the management board receive an email .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "cos it would be costly and also it would take more time to develop to have general generic remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not true .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the second claim that you put .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that it would be too long to develop .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that should be the same .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because received that email from management board and they seems to tell that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should focus on t_v_ more where it seems that the market is more important .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's good decision .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what's your opinion ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have i've no idea should know bit more about how fast we can design it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but continue with my presentation , it would be al you but we have some technical problem or so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can go to the whiteboard if you have some drawings to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if fact but do have .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now have enough cables .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like you feel bit like dog with this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so i'm just going to describe for remote control this is quite easy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we just have , i'm going like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm just going to describe .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have battery power supply here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "after that we just have user interface .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let's say that something like that , which could be let's say or an array of push button , something like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "push button or .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "after that we feed that into an electronic chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so say u_c_ and feed that to l_e_d_ which is infrared which is an infrared component .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so what we for myself this for us this is quite easy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "u_c_ is the central unit ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's this just chip which does all the numerical computation according to your display .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so for us this is quite easy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we just need to take to define what we want to do when the user interface wants something and after that we just do the coding to and send that to the not the to the television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so for us this is quite easy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is quite easy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we just have to define the processing power that we need especially if we want to do some speech recognition , in that case that mean that we are going to use more for simple .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there is not that much constraints .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this will think this will take more time to develop also .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and but for standard one this is really easy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's question of one month and so on no , say standard remote control takes one month to do that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to have you speak about with voi voice control ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "standard button one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the only time problem is the sp voice recognition .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition now ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would say about eight months to have the first results .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's bit long .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one month for the standard one with button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "even if we have display ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that this is really standard devices now .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for speech recognition .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we can take this into account .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so who would be good to go for like speech recognition ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we don't have time to market .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and also how much during the kickoff meeting you say that we shouldn't go up to twelve point five euro per unit so how many units should we sell to have but how many .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should contact management .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "each unit is sell twenty five euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how muc how much do you get how much do you if you buy one million units no , one hundred thousand units .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're gonna need chips .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how much will it cost for one hundred thousand ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because we are it seems that we want to sell like four million units from the first meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you have any idea for powerful one that has good enough for do speech recognition .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no it doesn't .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can look at the new requirement receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "had question do you want to continue with your presenta ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is it you say that don't remember by heart but thirty per cent of the tested people say that's it's quite difficult to use the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ask your question if you want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to keep in mind to access to that menu you should do something like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would they say that it's difficult to learn how to use it but when how to use it , it's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and but and what about if we design remote control which can be configure as you want ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's not intuitive first .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you say that want , have six button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "lot of people are if you have the screen if you can do it completely the way you want because the buttons also look the way you want them but it will be hard to configure imagine so it's really something for the expert user .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , but also it seems that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so there are markets and markets .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the young people are christine here said you have it is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so for our young people it will be , they can be able to use it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "their parents will not but they will configure it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if there is study about that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it would be more complex to configure it to be simple than creating simple product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and there are another thing is that if we make something that's simple and easy to use that's bas to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "otherwise , if it's different then everybody has somebody has to learn to use it first .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but also we see that most people find it find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and volume buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we may just make very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons and also some lightning too because most people find also hard to find the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "losed lose it etcetera .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "these are these two points are the main frustrations so if we design something very simple and easy to find when lost it will add serious competitive advantage without making something too complex and too long to develop .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so but le let us see first the new requirement .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we don't have to so this is in the this is in the same direction as we were speaking so we don't have to make very complex remote controls to access teletext and like that but then you have to you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pages and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but teletext is just one button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you just write the numbers .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so will you add with the channel keys , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's not used any more by users , they prefer to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm that it don't like but don't see just one button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if one button is still one more button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to our competitors .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "anyway have this point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can discuss .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also so as told before it would be better if it's only for the t_v_ because we want to be quick on the market .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then also we have to make very clear that this remote control is part of our products and show our corporate logo and colours on the design as so that they identify it as one of our product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is the key point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so before finishing we can define what would be the characteristic of the control of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so do you so from the marketing expert key aspect is the easy to use aspect , it should be very simple and most button are never used only ten per cent of the button are used often so we have to do something very simple and we all agree on that point , no ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it is going to be just t_v_ remote control it is going to be very simple .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the key point here is simple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so few buttons , channel , volume control and what el what function do you see in addition to that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's going to be as simple as possible then just have the remote control , there is no other function that see really .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "switch t_v_ on and off .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no you want to keep television on so that the advertising can revenue can come back to us .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "volume , mute button , and then on off button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's all ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "know that som you say that many people are doing plenty of lot of zapping .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "know tha discovered that when did quick look , they do now som they do something which is quite now , you have button , you press it , and this is the previous channel which has come back .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's memory , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can include that also .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "previous channel button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we have like channel button , the previous channel button , the volume button , plus mute button , and just the traditional on off button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the channel changing buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "talk about that , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how should they how should we implement that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because could be numerical only or could be also incremental .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "incremental definitely because zapping you switch them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's say that we can do something like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is incremental , but once you press it for long time , you go five by five .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we go faster ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to go fa to go faster .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's an interesting idea , that if you press it for long time it does something else , in general .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if you have your ten buttons for the numeric the numerical buttons and you have instead of having just one memory you have if you press them for long time no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "doesn't work does it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we should have also digit button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we should have complete keyboard and just type console commands .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "change channel to eight .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have also to have digits or only incremental .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "bec because if you have the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's useful like if you want to change between three channels then you cannot work with just memory being incremental .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it's not it isn't worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we need also digits .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can make very obvious the channel and volume button and smaller button down there with the digits .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when you zap usually you will have to press the same button all the time and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or we can do something like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can design the remote control to have access .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "some remote control have protection and so you , joystick .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "thought this thing there is are some with wheel like this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "instead of having the up down buttons for you can have the wheel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can have wheel for incremental .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so have wheel for incremental , have the digits on the lower side that can be closed so as you say protected , and this is the basi and do we have no , wheel is better .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "on the lower side it you have to turn it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we do that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or ball , not wheel but ball , and you say to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would say the wheel is better .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because of that because it's not like volume which is smooth ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what is the expert of .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the channels change one by one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you have to the user has to like to should feel the discrete sense bit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also we have to decide so it should be lightening in the dark because most people lost their remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'s quite it's quite easy we do that with back light on the wheel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "even if l_e_d_ or if it's the feature whatever , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "blue l_e_d_ and we sell that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and do we put an display ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because it was important for young customers if you remember .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's only put on if cou have multi function .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you do not multi function then there is no point in having .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just increase the cost .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the user does not have an advantage really .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so no speech as because it would delay too much the development process .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's going to delay but it will be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because user could say c_n_n_ and it would go c_n_n_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but eight months is really long and we can just .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so will so we will move to next
