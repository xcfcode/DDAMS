no .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so welcome to the marketing presentation once again .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this time about trendwatching .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there has been inv investigation again , in the remote control market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it shows number of developments .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "will address them in moment .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fashion watch watchers have detected the trends for young public , because that's our public .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothing , shoes and furniture .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the feel of the material is expected to be spongey .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the developments will address them this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so to give you an idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "most important aspect for remote control happens to be fancy look-and-feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "instead of the current functional look-and-feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and the interface .", "speaker":

that was the marketing presentation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "had only one document left .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and shall go first ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't mi don't mind .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's do you want to go first ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this so small example .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "nothing about the buttons but just sponge thing , and some fruit and colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just made quick design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's better than my drawing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you're just the user interface ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but have to design the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you probably opened it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'm dealing with the components design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "used some design examples we had from similar products .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and used possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's why had to , wanted to go first .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they gave me an idea about what people want .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we're mainly focusing on this group , but want to make the distinction clear .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "could not drag the pictures into the slides so don't have examples of how it looks like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it comes down to what you think we should do with the spongey and the fruity looking type .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you , the young dynamic people want soft primary colours , which looks like fruits , you can and shapes that are curved and not solid straight lines anymore .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this goes on to what you were mentioning earlier .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there is lot of factors involved in choosing the components .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's lot of options that we have to discuss .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the energy source .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have four types .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the basic battery .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have hand dynamo , which we dutch refer to it as the kneipgatt .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing , if you shake it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which will be fun for toddlers , if they wanna use the and solar cells .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but how we would use that into the design of the actual product .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wi an indoors .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so my also in countries where there's isn't much light like in scandinavia , they wouldn't be able to use it half of the year .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "calculator's can do it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's not either .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so for the case , there's the traditional uncurved flat hard case .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "single curved , which means that it has curves in one dimension .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or the double curved .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wasn't able to finish my personal preferences sheet , but that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the case materials .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have all kinds of hard materials like the hard plastic , the wood and the titanium .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would definitely go for rubber 'cause it fits most in what people wanna see nowadays .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "poo , this is lot of text .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wasn't able to organise this yet .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have several interface designs .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can use scroll buttons for the menus , but we already decided to go for the pushbuttons , for the arrow buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's not really interesting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we wanna decide on what electronics to use the advanced chip is easiest to implement for the production , 'cause they can print it better .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is about it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was working on some per personal preferences .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "first chose for the battery , 'cause i'm traditional and that's the most obvious , easiest choice to go to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but really think that we should think about the kinetic energy , where you have to move the thing to be able to use it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as an optional feature .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or combine both with one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can only choose one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can only fit one source of energy on the didn't receive any info .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we imagine that the kinetic type energy source would be more expensive to make .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it is more longlasting , that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it's more fun .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it's also more fun .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "always chuck my remote control around , so exactly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just playing with it and especially when the material's rubber .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it can be done , you can't harm it , so it's perfect combination .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and throw it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you don't have to be scared about bouncing it off the floor and breaking it or whatever .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's the end of it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so double curved is like this , or .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no it means curved in two dimensions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so single curved ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let's say would be square box , but then with curves on one dimension .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and double curved would means that it would have curves in every direction .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also in height ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like three d_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one very important thing was thinking about is the speech option .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we were going to use that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's one thing which i'm not of how to implement it into the remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the visual representation is not there with speech but you can .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no but it has to be combined with the menu for functions and so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can just match the speech commands with the functions that are already present .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so don't think you have to design anything else for that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with the programme .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but do we do the speech just for the basic options , for the simple buttons ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for everything , also for the advanced options ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have this very basic trendy design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "everybody says it so that's what's in the last meeting we were putting the simple and the advanced options separated .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "pressing the menu option will disable all other options on your remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and only the panel will light up and then you can only change the options .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the buttons that you need to control it , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "design has to be very attractive but that's your op your .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have to delete this but this is the simple layout .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "display on the upper side with the menu button and some cancel button or save button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would be the back .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm the back .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you did read the minutes wrote ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you did read the minutes wrote ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "little bit but not everything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause summed up all the buttons there were .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so hate doing work for nothing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "didn't read that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but this is the basic design for the buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wanted to categorise everything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "with speech display , sound , everything you noted in your minutes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "every pushbutton has its own led light .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can change make it more trendy for younger people .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if there are older people they wanted more luxurous so that's an also an option .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that was it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that was it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what we have to decide is what components do we use ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "energy source , chip type , case type .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and user interface .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but didn't see clear distinction between these so what we have is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the case would be doubly curved .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so rubber material .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's the only thing we have left .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we need the chip on print to be able to support the screen and audio function .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no it's easy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's is that the advanced chip ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "otherwise you would have simple chip , just for pressing buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we need more .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm just thinking , this is not my department , but i'm not what this is gonna cost , to be able to so 'cause we need to sell it for twenty five euro piece .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "didn't get any info on this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's gonna be difficult ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the cost of making it should be twelve and half ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have total here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "didn't get any information about that so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're going to produce it in china so it's no problem .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "child labour man , we love it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's cheap .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is there new thing ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the interface type supplements .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the interface , can .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's quite difficult because we haven't got all the options .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you have picture of doubly curved case ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and could you put that in the group folder ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let me see .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "of the project folder .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you go to your homepage , you should get your own information .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm going there now .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "got my fresh and fyoo fruity picture also over there , so no .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you didn't draw it yourself .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "too less time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "also the menu .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is the menu was looking at .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was thinking of that also , with arrow .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that indicates that there's an menu under that menu .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's easier if you come over here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'s the target group .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see this is the standard traditional type , where the form serves the function , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's like really basic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but this is more appealing to old people and we don't want that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is what we're looking for .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that means curved in both dire dimensions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not only like this but it has to be exactly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also like this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you can hold it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it has to be instead of the playstation , the module .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it has to be like the game cube , where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be to hold .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it has also to it has also to be luxurous for rich people .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it ha but that's the problem the dilemma actually , 'cause we wanna appeal to the young public with fancy with flashy colours , and with lot of shape .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this looks little bit like for only for children .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the children's story .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i've got it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , and the rubber , it will look cheap always , with the there is mobile phones , in which you can change the colour also of the lights .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the colours , you can make it make the colours with leds beneath the buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you press button and you can disable the colour leds for people that don't like it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we should consider this function .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to customise it and so kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours and people who want something , different , or more design , they can go for one colour like this photo camera .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "personally it's really ugly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just give me the thing that it's inside there i'm too old for this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but this the is for the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "very cheap look .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so those are all my .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and this is , this is with the curved that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's singly curved .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that should be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "could make compromise between that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if it's worth the effort .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "compromise between what ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "instead of doubly curved we take single curved .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so to appeal little more to the all the public .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so there's only in this dimension .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this , this would be single curved ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so curvy or not .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we keep it singly single curved then ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that would be an option .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what you think .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the our aim is to make something different ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to make something new .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would go for the double curved .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and i'm thinking drawing palette , where you have the shape for your thumb .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it holds nicely , something like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if you make it more curved we can make more and more options for buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is really your decision but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you have it in your hand , you are not only you don't need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can make trigger button like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "something to shoot at your television .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or that is the confirmation button , that you scroll with your thumb , with the arrows , and then confirm .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that would be way to use it but , i'm thinking big already , and we need something that you can able to use in one hand .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or one hand solution .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so from top view it looks kinda like this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but from the side you can have it also in shape .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because the screen is on top you can have you can have this shape .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can turn it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to switch from buttons to interface .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you turn it little .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that the screen is more towards yourself , so you can easily see your screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "least you can easily see it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ll you have it in your hand so it's an angle from your eyes to the screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so then you have double curved in some way .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this is so the screen is positioned over here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "something like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the buttons are more , t's very thick now but that's ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "understand what you mean .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how about we do pop-up screen , like the laptop .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you can flip .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that the only the simple functions will be visible at first .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that you can press it and then it comes up ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then if you want .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or but then the side view can be straight .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "something like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you have the side view .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you have pop-up screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but if that's too expensive .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so and you want to be able to make this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's too much the advanced buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no like would draw it like this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let's say this is the side view .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that you have screen that will come up here , and can go down that way .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that it would come up like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the buttons are on top here , and you flip it over that way .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or preferably even keep the simple buttons here , and then under the screen even you could put more advanced buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the more advanced options were for the menu .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you want .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for the menu ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you just want to hide them all ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so activate and the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no not all because you need most of them , the arrow buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you can hide the and the back button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the menu button also because when you flip it open and you can even drop the menu button because if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto automatically .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so but you have you need some button to flip this open .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you could just make it mechanical .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you can make , you can make trigger here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it says menu and it flips open and then you have the buttons to control it , in combination with your true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's but it's not very strong if you drop it one time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it can go open .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the idea of it was , is that because you close it , you cover the screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you cover it with rubber .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "an adv and it will be covered in some thin rubber layer like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it can bounce .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we just have to make that the closing mechanism won't break .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's very no it's very strong .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's very solid .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that may work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that actually will offer some extra protection for the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then we still have the thing of the shape .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was thinking , if you have your hand , it this is your .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the lower part doesn't work , so you should try it over there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if this is your thumb , and this is your hand like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "with your wrist .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that you , that it would be shape like this , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's easier to hold in your hand , to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but when you are left-handed , that's problem .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then you would have to make it like this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can design two versions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that's very expensive .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like you drew here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then make this thicker also than the centre .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "give it would give it female shape but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and ergonomical shape .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the female shape .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could make some rubber mouse , with which you can change and so if you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "make it more appealing to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we have hardware inside , which is so it has to have some basic shape .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that's optional for later .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have to make we better so choose one so we should better choose one sh one shape .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and also the screen , you cannot mould it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that's the idea , so it lays good in the hand , and then on the side with your thumb , you can use , you can use the button option spongey .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then you can place the screen here , which can come .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the keywords are primary co colours , spongey ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and but then would do the arrows here , thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "spongey can be reached by means of .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the simple buttons here , so that eah that's what .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the control thngs in the middle ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no the arrow's over here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the arrows over here , and here the simple or do we wanna make its shape look like banana ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then numbers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that it's design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it looks pretty fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "bananas wierd shape and other fruits also , so it's better to have some basic print and then fruit print in some primary colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could make we should use we need very primary colours , like bright red , bright yellow .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what colours should the basic print be like ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like some soft green ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or and then , dark blue and then very bright , yellow banana , an orange , green apple , like that , with very bright tones .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "dark blue or .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you have something like .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the primary colours we can create with the leds on the remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you we .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you make it just bl give it blue colour , then it's just neutral colour , also for the more for the people .", "speaker": "B"},

"speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's blue .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "two hours further .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "wh why not go for the twenty ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's what call painting .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then on top of that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's dark blue basic colour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then with some yellow banana like .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and how about some flashing standby lights ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like you have on the samsung , don't like to call brands phones , the that 'cause remember from one of our first meetings that people lose their remote controls often .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it not only in the colours of the leds , that we want something to keep it visible times , or .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how do you mean ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you if flashing colour so you can't lose it , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "some an orange .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's bit too much but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright this is more like purple , but it's should be more real dark blue , so the contrast with the fruit objects is pretty high .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that would be device .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and which colour should give the display ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the colour of the background of the display ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't it has to be sixty six five thousand colour , so too expensive .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then you can use yellow or semething .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so just blue backlight like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "green is too old-fashioned .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but blue , blue's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as long as you loo use high contrast between the background and the foreground colour .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "white backlight , and dark .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that people with and also for people who are bit colourblind .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "dark letters , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "whatever which is visible .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "know you sh you should test it under light conditions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's hard to tell .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no so that's mostly red and green believe .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which colour should the buttons be ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no but they have to they have to have some colour ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's how we are going to make it more trendy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or is it too expensive ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if the background is very dark blue ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but don't we wanna make the background the bright colo colours ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the total of the thing is very bright ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can flashy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like the pictures showed you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "those things were all like bright red , bright red , flashy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so more like doesn't work very .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "more like this colour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "something like that , something that stands out more .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then yellow and orange and red objects on it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but then again , which colour should the buttons be ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the press buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "should they be white or black or but it's pretty fresh , on the other side .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it looks quite cheap , that colour .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's actually pretty trendy colour at the moment .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "my couch is in that colour .",

you have five minutes left or so something like this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "left and then have to kick you out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that should be pretty colour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the buttons , all buttons in red is bad contrast for colourblind people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no that's actu red and green are actually the easiest to discriminate .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because the of the green .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the buttons have their own leds or not ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they have leds but they have colour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "even for colourblind .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they will see one of each as grey .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if you use green on blue , those colours will look the same .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so red buttons are ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that that's default setting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can make them red .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the red buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you need to keep in mind that the leds are just extra light .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how do you mean ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they don't determine the colour that much , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was think about red leds and blue leds and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause you have to print on them you have background .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no that's too busy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "each number is transparent .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "partly but you have to print on the number .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or the sign .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you can't change the colour so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you better bet better keep the led and the button itself in the same colour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so just an extra bit of light and attention .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "bit of light .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can what we should do is make see-through plastic button , with one coloured led behind it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "bit of feedback .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that the whole button will shine as the colour the and if you think about easy to use buttons , we have to , have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold for both hands , but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb , if you hold the machine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "with don't mean to discourage you but you two are going to work on the smartboard .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "next thirty minutes to design something so and the you will do the evaluation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "of the product ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which we don't have yet .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so wh how should do that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you probably get mail .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or you send it to me .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or just because you are going to design it on this board ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "once they are finished .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you can do the evaluation you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make procedure which to follow .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "probably get instruction on that , how to do that , so make another presentation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "kn 's gonna happen in so i've basic idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you have the basic idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you two are going to do this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're gonna work here ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on this sketchboard ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "alright so that's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so make new page and be creative .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we have to do it at this moment , after this meeting ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have thirty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we have to see something which we can show to the management .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is the what we are thinking about ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "shall we make new , make new one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let's just delete all these or , next .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and save this board .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just save it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll just keep it there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but just press save and it'll be fine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "on the left .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can also include clip-art .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if you'll rather draw in paint then look .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so shall we make some outline sketches of the basic shape first ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because 'cause have to focus on the basic look-and-feel design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then after that we can make the user inter interface .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so how it's gonna look .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you have to think how we're gonna put the screen in it and those things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if i'm drawing and you think i'm not gonna be able to put screen in there , you have to correct .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we skip this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "sound button press .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you mind if draw in black then ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can also include it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not much work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for normal sketches .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "light only button user ca user interaction .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we want the girlish figure .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the pl the plastic buttons also help because of they are only lit during interaction .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm not so good at drawing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so t's good thing that the buttons aren't , that they are plastic , because then you can light up the light on when they are usable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you should draw it very large like this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but this part isn't functioning properly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how do we or insert text ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just start typing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's bit large .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's bit big .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you also do the other sides .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not only on the front si the top side but also the side view .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's make first the all the views .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for the side view , that the basic section would be rather bit thicker than the middle , where you're holding it with your 'cause your fingers have to fit underneath and exactly but the upper side has to be bit more like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the front view , side view and the back view .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what do write down ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "why can't work here ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is much easier .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "much easier , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the middle has to be very small so you can have it in your hand .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't see sign that the meeting is over yet but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no so work here few minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the display , we can put display .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't you think ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the display we will put in here , the basic functions in here , where it's most reachable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the arrow functions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is hard .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what do don't have to draw it exactly do we ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let me try it one more time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've it's easier if draw it in once .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it will become way more ugly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can make it larger .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's easier to draw that's the basic idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this'll take forever .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's fun to work with this pen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , larger .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "five minutes left before the meeting ends .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "only if you are going to put buttons on the side of the unit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the question .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we is it if this is from the side woah .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's fill in the buttons later .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is gonna be from the from .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "from the i'm may it's easier to integrate the screen just into this bubble .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because there the screen goes up like that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so then it's like this , or that's not convenient because then you have the screen like this and look like the it's better to have it somewhat like this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or does it flip all the way ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the idea is that it has to flip up to here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because it do doesn't have to flip then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because we have en enough space for making an l_c_d .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because here but why do we need the flipping .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's better to have this like this , and then flip it like this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can adjust the angle to which it flips .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it can also from this angle , it can flip all the way up to there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can flip it up to there if you want .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we still keep the flipping mechanism .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we keep the flip ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "keep the flip live .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the shape is but ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't see the why we should use the flipping mechanism .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it would be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's for more trendy because we have enough space .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we should then there the middle sh shouldn't we integrate it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "here we got the basic functions , the arrow button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then we sh .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then like doh .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this is the shape .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it hasn't but the screen is bit lower because if it falls on the other side , it doesn't fall on the screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it doesn't aim so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then it's no flipping or you wanted the flipping so but if you drop it just breaks .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so there's layer of rubber on the side .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so no flipping but just no .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but most votes count ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it has to be very strong because of the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it's also for the children , it's for people not sixteen years .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "throwing and the kinetics .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we better make we better make it like this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just light on top .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you if you're going for the kinetics .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they are responsible enough to have mobile phone , so also to deal with their remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but there are more .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that the target group .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm just thinking different designs also .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ended the meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you two go design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "remember that the weird pocketphone thingy which looked like gameboy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "by the way .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "thought up name for our product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we should try something like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's called the real remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with copyright sign after real .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the real remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can include that somewhere .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this can go .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should work in our own room ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have to include that in our design as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't see any power cables here so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what the hell's that ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's the sensors .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the side .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but do we want options on the side with the buttons ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or just leave it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "could make an volume button scroll , volume button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or also scrolling for the .", "speaker": "C"},
