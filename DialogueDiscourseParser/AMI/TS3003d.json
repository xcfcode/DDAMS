for recognition .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "with different colour than the case .", "speaker": "C"},

it's cheaper .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , we've still got four buttons , but just so you got not butt button itself , but on the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they count the materials .",

we have the advanced chip we can just count this as one button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but no but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , this really is four buttons anyhow .", "speaker": "D"},

also save money on the chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "only the docking station , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which isn't the docking station isn't even in this schematic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's not even taken into the price .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should to different supplier .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's an option .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't you think we can , if we can count this as one button , and integrate these buttons in three , then we save lot of money as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could save money on it .", "speaker": "C"},

"speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you leave out the l_c_ display .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it would be pretty rigid one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if you use less buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "say or you can take the single chip .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , you can't use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there it is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we want to make so fancy and good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but then good looking .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wi with , with attractive options .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , you can stay below twelve fifty .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so scroll-wheel's one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's difficult as , but or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or becoming choice between like either good remote and higher production cost , or just any other remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then because then we save ten buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's we're getting closer .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then we have five and one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we have this one and we've got the advanced , we're getting close .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but how does scroll-wheel work here ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then you will or you can scroll .",

{"text": "so if you scroll to number and then you half second , then it turns to that channel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would be like the end of our usability .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it would definitely crop cost , lot .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , t's the teletext subtitles are now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight , and teletext disappears .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we need the battery .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the regular chip is not possible ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it has to be advanced ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you want to use an screen you need an advanced chip , yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it has to be advanced .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we can save euro by flat design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's an option we can then we're almost there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you could just leave out one more button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if we but that's that is big advantage , if we're but can we use can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or we have to skip the subtitle button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's big advantage .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , it's , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you push it three times ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the subtitles stay there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but if you push the teletext button twice it's one , few buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the case on most , that could be just like the scroll to eight ,

"speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's not really that no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then again that would be just not an option for older people , who don't even scroll-wheel is .", "speaker":

you make good advertisement on television and in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you just make it real simple .", "speaker":

.", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how to use the other bu buttons as subtitles .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it's good for the innovative design as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you would erase these .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we put looks bit odd .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's pretty big scroll wheel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that is something like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've got the scroll-wheel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and these are two buttons then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could make two buttons out of that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and just if you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel .",

"A"}, {"text": "and it will make the use of the scroll wheel more obvious .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we make one for the volume , one for the channel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if we .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we've got one , two , three .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can leave the teletext in if we want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat case .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is five buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and make it smaller overall .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if you put the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button , the screen behi under that , than the scroll button you get much smaller remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then you can .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it sh ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we can decrease this one to four buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now we have five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , you can make quite big remote control for just the same price as small one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's no problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it it's bit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's more the moulds in which they are being made , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "single curved is really easy to just fill in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and cases come out of the machine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and single curved you have to have different machine , than flat one .", "speaker":

"richard's argument was very good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but since we just have to .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have to cut costs .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm ag ask for more money .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'd rather just go to the board and get us to spend eighteen dollars remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "am agreeing with the usability .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or do some market research and see what the options are .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we can then keep the single curved one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just to express our screen bit more .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it will be necessary to have good help function , as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is scroll .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it was better to have this price list bit earlier .", "speaker": "A"},

{"text": "like old buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's recognisable for them as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's good one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , i'm afraid we have to move on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it's less frightening , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if they see this design they think , there are only five buttons , and but we will see .", "speaker": "A"},
