[{"edus": [{"text": "this is the kick-off meeting for our project .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and this is just what we're gonna be doing over the next twenty five minutes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so first of all , just to make that we all know each other , i'm laura and i'm the project manager .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you want to introduce yourself again ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "hi , i'm david and i'm supposed to be an industrial designer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and i'm andrew and i'm our marketing expert .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm craig and i'm user interface .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we're designing new remote control and have to record who's here actually .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's david , andrew and craig , isn't it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you all arrived on time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so des design new remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as you can see it's supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's our brief , as it were .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so there are three different stages to the design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm not really what you have already received in your emails .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what did you get ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "got the project announcement about what the project is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "designing remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's about it , didn't get anything else .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that what everybody got ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "did you get the same thing ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're gonna have like individual work and then meeting about it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and repeat that process three times .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so who would like to go first ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this one here , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "my favourite animal is like beagle .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "charac favourite characteristics of it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take lot of physical affection from their family .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , that they have lots of personality and be fit and in robust good health .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this is blue .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "my family's beagle .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "my favourite animal would be monkey .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then they're small cute and furry , and when planet of the apes becomes real , i'm gonna be up there with them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's too much gear .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can take as long over this as you like , because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't feel like you're in rush , anyway .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "coulda told you whole lot more about beagles .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ach why not we might have to get you up again then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "boy , let me tell you .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what mine is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm gonna have to think on the spot now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that whale ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "anyway , it's just the first animal think off the top of my head .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "big reason is 'cause i'm allergic to most animals .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "allergic to animal fur , so fish was natural choice .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", and like whales .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they come in and go eat everything in sight .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and they're quite harmless and mild and interesting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "still what i'm gonna write about .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "superb sketch , by the way .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "tail's bit big , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was gonna choose dog as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but i'll just draw different dog .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my favourite animal is my own dog at home .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that doesn't really look like him , actually .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "he looks more like pig , actually .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "see dog in there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's very good of you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now see rooster .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what kind is it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "he's mixture of various things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and what do like about him , that's just to suggest that his tail wags .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , and very affectionate and he's quite wee as so he can doesn't take up too much space .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and he does funny thing where he chases his tail as , which is quite amusing , so it is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is he aware that it's his own cha tail he's chasing ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "he only does it after he's had his dinner and he'll just all of sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's an after dinner dog then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "where did you find this ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just down here ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what are we doing next ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we now need to discuss the project finance .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so according to the brief we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five euro , and we're aiming to make fifty million euro .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we don't want it to cost any more than twelve fifty euros , so fifty percent of the selling price .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can we just go over that again ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so bas at twel alright , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so cost like production cost is twelve fifty , but selling price is that wholesale or retail ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like on the shelf .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "imagine that's good question .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "our sale anyway .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the retailer to sell it for whatever price they want .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have bearing on how we design it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "away i'm wondering if there's , like with d_v_d_ players , if there are zones .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "regions and , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "frequencies as characters , different keypad styles and symbols .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for remote control , do you think that will be suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it does make sense from the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like european languages , then you need more buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , possibly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then al the other thing international is on top of the price .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm thinking the price might appeal to certain market in one region , whereas in another it'll be different , so just chara just characteristic of the just or just like , basic product podi positioning , the twenty five euro remote control might be big hit in london , might not be such big hit in greece , who knows , something like that , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what , just like in terms of like the wealth of the country ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like how much money people have to spend on things like ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "aye , see what you mean , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "good marketing thoughts .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "gosh , should be writing all this down .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "away i'm making some assumptions about what information we're given here , thinking , trendy probably means something other than just basic , something other than just standard .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so i'm wondering away , is selling twenty five euros , is that the thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like how much does , remote control cost .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "twenty five euro , that's about like eighteen pounds , isn't it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or no , is it as much as that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'd say so , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", i've never bought remote control , so how good remote control that would get you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , suppose it has to look and gimmicky .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let me just scoot on ahead here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "does anybody have anything to add to the finance issue ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "thin no , actually .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would be useful , though , wouldn't it , if you knew like what your money would get you now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "interesting thing about discussing production of remote control for me is that as you point out , don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's just like getting shoelaces with shoes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it just comes along .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "five minutes to end of meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're bit behind .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like so like how do you one way of looking at it would be , the people producing television sets , they have to buy remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or another way is people who have t_v_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want better one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "know my parents went out and bought remote controls because they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so for them it was just how many devices control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so do you think that should be like main design aim of our remote control , do your satellite and your regular telly and your v_c_r_ and everything ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like , what we could use is like example of successful other piece technology is palm pilots .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they're gone from being just like little scribble boards to cameras , m_p_ three players , telephones , everything , agenda .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , like , wonder if we might add something new to the remote control market , such as the lighting in your house , or , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or even like , notes about what you wanna watch .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like you might put in there want to watch such and look that's good idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so extra functionalities .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like , personally for me , at home i've combined the audio video of my television set and my d_v_d_ player and my c_d_ player .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so they all work actually function together but have different remote controls for each of them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's ironic that then they're in there , the sound and everything it's just one system .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but each one's got its own little part .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'd wel we're gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll just check we've nothing else .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls they've used , what they would really like to be part of this new one ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you keep losing them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you keep losing them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "finding them is really pain , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's usually quite small , or when you want it , it slipped behind the couch or it's kicked under the table .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make really high pitched noise they beep .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's just really good id .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there is that something we'd want to include , do you think ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "remember when the first remote control my family had was on cable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "actually had cable between it and the t_v_ and big like buttons that like , like on blender .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , when about what they are now , it's better , but actually it's still , like massive junky thing on the table .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "still feels quite primitive .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could think about how , could be more , streamlined .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like touch screen ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "something like that , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or whatever would be technologically reasonable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's up to our industrial designer .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause it could be that it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better , but that just the appeal of not having , these days there's pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it looks better .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "nicer materials and might be worth exploring anyway .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so just to wrap up , the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's about ten to twelve by my watch .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so inbetween now and then , as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on the actual working design of it so what you're doing there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for user interface , technical functions , that's like what we've been talking about , what it'll actually do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and marketing executive , you'll be just thinking about what it actually what , what requirements it has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's the functional design stage is next , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that's the end of the meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so got that little message lot sooner than would , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "before we wrap up , just to make we're all on the same page here , do we were given an example of coffee machine , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are we at ma now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or are we keeping like design commitment to television features ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just very quickly 'cause this we're supposed to finish now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's up to us , you probably want some unique selling point of it , so , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one factor would be production cost .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because there's cap there , so depends on how much you can cram into that price .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that that's the maor .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", we'll that's the end of the meeting , then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , all for coming .", "speaker": "B"}],
