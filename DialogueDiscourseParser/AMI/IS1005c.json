[{"edus": [{"text": "hello , this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the goal of this meeting is to reach decision at the end on the concept and the last time we talked about an lot and we had rough idea of what is going to be , but in at the end of this meeting we have to reach decision .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and hope it will be fast because would like to have time to for long discussion and decisions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , who wants to start ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , you can start .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so start , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can you open my presentation , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm number four .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can you pass the mouse , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from looking at some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the fashion trends we got from talking to our contacts in the fashion industry based in paris and milan .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so from our market research we've come to the conclusion that fancy look and feel , as opposed to functional look and feel , is our number one priority .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fancy is the , highest priority .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "secondly that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this is number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and third thirdly the easiness of use is the is important as , but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "from our fashion people in paris and milan , we've discovered that this year fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in clothes , shoes and furniture .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , i'm pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and also the feel of material this year is expected to be spongy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so hopefully our remote control reflects that in some way .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what does it mean , spongy ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like soft , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "soft , like sponge .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so in conclusion , we need our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy , has lots of technolog tech technology in it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "somehow would be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with spongy feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that it's easy to use and from our last meeting our fabian told us that one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our of the real reaction company .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "easy to use , is it as much as important than technology or fancy thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's less important , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so fanciness first and then two ti , half as important as that is technology , and half important as technology is easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , hamed , can you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the second one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "could you show the presentation number three .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just could you check if it is the first one or the second .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , it's the first one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the second one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's not this one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so am going to talk about little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy , but , we can discuss about it later .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "generally , generally this remote control should be something , in my opinion , the first feature is just to be easy to use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , the more frequent buttons should be larger , they should be placed in good position inside the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it should be we shouldn't need to es open book and start reading and learning how to use this remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what found out that as said it's better to put more frequent ke buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control , and they should be bigger in size .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the shape of remote control should be in way which can which should be taken easily in hand .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it should not be completely like cube .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it should be it should have round edge , so then it's easier .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and just like some toys , some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not consume lots of energy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and my personal preference is , as said , just putting this buttons in special places and covered some buttons which are not used that much like settings button , like mobile phone .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part , so we can cover these buttons which are not used or number buttons for the can channels , and just put volume change or ch can channel change buttons in the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if the user needed to do some more complex task he can open the cover and then change settings like this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also if we put some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not on remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but just inside .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "sliding or rolling , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with thumb .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it can be another preference .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and but usage of speech recogn recogniser can be good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "know that it consumes lots of energy , but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it may not be very useful but because it's new , people may buy it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "personally think there should be big difference between something .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "otherwise they prefer to buy something which is coming from famous company , or .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so good news from me for me from hamed , but bad news from bob , because spongy design , don't like it as , so could you , fabien , open it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm person two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and which one , probably the first one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm not but check the first one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "most of the things have to write myself on the board , but , that's it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this one , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just it's only this slide ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is just one thing wanted to mention and show you that found this , that our company developed seven fingers or i'll just , seven inch t_ t_f_t_ screen , which is good news for us , since we wanted to include display there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so probably draw it down raw scheme .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is the that use to , so the this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "first thing is this will be the overall shape , no i'm not speaking about the real shape of the device , but the shape of the inside of the device .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so there will be some circuit for the power .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , say power circuit here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can and if we decide to use the speech recognition there , we must use additional source of energy , which found the best is to use the solar cells which can supply everything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was computing all the things related to the speech recognition , and it's to use just two batteries and solar cells , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so no problem .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there can be also solar cell .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , so this is my like hard requirement for the from the design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so at least seven to seven .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it depends where you put your screen , because the screen is seven inch , so it depends on you where you put it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it doesn't matter .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's just one cord from the main board to the screen which can be elsewhere .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this will be t_f_t_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and on the main board we have the interface to the microphone , which is somewhere , say here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "interface to the microphone .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then the graphical card for the t_f_t_ and the third unit is the i_r_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the good news is that we can we decided to use the infra-red unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra-red , including all the inside , so it will be very cheap for us .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so infra-red here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the once again the overall requirements , seven to seven centimetres for the board , which has to be which can be spongy but has to be this size , and the t_f_t_ which is seven inches .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have to check what wanted to from my point of view don't care about the material used for the overall des ov all the device .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can you fit any t_f_t_ or any electronic device in spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "put electronic card on spongy thing , imagine it could be problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "all these things in this box are to put in any shape , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we have to take care of the t_f_t_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it good feature , since it takes if it's around the t_f_t_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it can have two shells , hard shell inside and spongy shell outside .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so ca can ask question .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "put electronic in box and spongy thing around .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's related to the u_i_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's all from me .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this seven inch t_f_t_ screen , how big is it in reality ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "seven to seven inches .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's quite big .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have we decided that we're gonna use this t_f_t_ screen ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but to be honest , was , honestly speaking was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially , but it's seven inches .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , don't t's seven by seven , it's seven the diagonal is seven .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "usually when they say seven inch it's the diagonal .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but even that is like this big .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "dun one each .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we can cut it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can cut the t_f_t_ screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no problem , because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , but no problem to me to cut the screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so let's cut the t_f_t_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so for the same price we have four screens now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "these technical engineers , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , what's the size of the device ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is like this is almost nothing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "seven to at least some three millimetres .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "even from my perspective seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still is it can you hold that , or ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we wanted the big buttons and like that , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because if it's too small we can lose it , at home , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what user wants .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "he wants small remote control , or ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "small control that they can hold in hand .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "with big buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that it should fit in the hand .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "sm so you can finish your presentation , and afterwards we will discuss about all this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but is something that's seven centimetres square easy to hold ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that , but just like this , and follow , that's no task for me , but seven to seven at least , but , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we have lot we have to take decision today , so we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first energy it's key problem because it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries , like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because can we have and speech recognition with battery , and it's also related to the size of the devi of the device ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not just point to the energy things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's for l_ speech recognition and , so no problem in energy , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we have to use the solar cell .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like but using how many batteries , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are what is the size of the battery .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was thinking just common a_a_ cells .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so like three to five centimetres , exactly , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if we use solar cells , where is the sun if someone's watching t_v_ inside ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "doesn't need to be sun .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it it's just the daylight , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the television lights .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "suppose that this remote control won't be in the room like this , where there is light only when there are people , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "at least when there is t_v_ you can get light from the t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "from the t_ don't t's enough , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's compromise , no ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "at least it's new and technology new technology .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's why wanted to include the speech recognition , because you wanted all the new things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's quite innovative , yes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if you watch t_v_ outside it's very useful .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so before talking about the other thing , it's important thing it's the case .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what are gonna be the size , because its weight drives the other what we are going to use as features and so on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for the , if we choose to have small device , we cannot use this such screen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the screen is , but the board , that's the problem .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what would you as shape ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or what would be the shape ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "their being large or small is not important .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the only important thing is to be able to take it in inside hand easily .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so let's say an average size , and it should not be very heavy also .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and prefer to is it shouldn't have uniform shape , so in the middle it should be little bit thinner , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we it's like some joysticks .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can take some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's designed for your taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the general shape should be like this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "seven centimetre by seven centimetre is little bit large .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so seven not seven but let's say five by ten it's that's my opinion .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which is the same area .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "could you re could you redesign your board ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "five to ten .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "five centimetres by ten centimetres .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's feasib one how could we do it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could put the board next to , under the and make the be unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like holding something , and the to be just on top of it , somehow .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but let's stick to the spongy thing , like one unit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i've the easiest thing would be to have smaller , if it's possible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "fi five to ten it would be feasible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so five to ten , it's feasible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we are agree with small .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll make it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or but don't want to now invent something new , because we didn't discuss about it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "fo five by ten .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so using some l_c_d_s we can touch , so we can remove keys and just having , the name , responding to fingers .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "touching the screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "something like tactile .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "touch screen , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so but for now if we don't want to use such screens we using smaller screen is better , because smaller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the problem is we have limit in month of time , so we cannot do something very new .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so let's go for small .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so t's it's definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , so just give me the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me and will work it out .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , five by ten .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what about , so the case we talked about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "something easy to use , you said something easy to use but how does that fit in fashion way , like with fruit and vegetable , and about the colour and logo of the company and so on , now , can we do that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the it should be easy to take in hand , about banana , like that , which is fruits , and big banana .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "seven to ten banana .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "rather mango or .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what other fruit and vegetables do of any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's just an idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what you think about , but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if it can fit with the technology .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you are the specialists of that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you mean banana .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if it's if it if the banana is big enough .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , and the screen has to be square ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if you want to look at the screen , no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ll , it can be whatever you want .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is not good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or it can be like shape , quite , with curves .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's like more expensive to have shape like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but don't care .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we fit this requirement .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'d like shaped screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's more important than saving bit of money on the t_f_t_ screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the banana could be like bit fatter than the common one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it should remember banana , but it's not doesn't have to be really the size and exactly the shape of banana .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but like modified banana , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we'll stick to banana , or ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we are agree with the banana thing ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , the last point we decided it's infra-red , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's it about the concepts .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have other thing to add to this point , or no ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , about the user interface , so we are going to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in the last meeting we talked about hidden buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what we are going to do with that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you talked about the buttons on the side what ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like peeling of the banana you it would be , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "peeling of the banana .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "peeling of the banana , should discover the other buttons , which are hidden .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you mean the first layer would be spongy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first layer spo , it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so is it possible to do that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it would be idea , but is it possible technically ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like doing spongy layer of the banana , and you open it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we have spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that , to manipulate that to hav be cover that you can pull off and for .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "some something like plastic cover covering some interface , u_s_b_ interface as in the in digital camera .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you see it's like peeling .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you open plastic cover and you see some u_s_b_ interfaces , some interfaces for adaptor .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so keys can be buttons can be covered like this , with plastic cover and when you open this cover it's like peeling banana .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , something like this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but do you see that as rigid thing , or like banana , something very soft , you can open like banana , or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it possible to make it soft ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", it's lic like plastic cover , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if it's so then it's ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , what you think , bob , but it would be for users , and very good for marketing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the softer the better .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "honestly speaking , not imagine it , so far , but it will be terrible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and setting buttons hidden in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "other remarks , or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "something we didn't talk about yes yet , or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we are almost there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how can we , if we have soft thing , like this , and to open it we have to attach it somewhere , how to do that technically , or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and how , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could use velcro .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or ma magnetic thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , it's good idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or it can is it can be plastic cover sticking to the all the like with magnetic materials in the border , so it's it sticks like refrigerator door , completely .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and when you try to open it , it will be opened easily .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you can be that it will not be open while you're while you are commonly using buttons on the banana .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and what would be the matter here of the first layer ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "soft plastic , or , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "imagine some vinyl thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in with suede feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "since the things like the screen and how to say that , solar cell has to be has to be like kept in the shape , we cannot so we need that the peeling but we should take care of these two things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , if the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed , then the material must be able to put the light inside , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that we can reach the energy out of it out of that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you're saying is it possible to have solar cell and this removable cover and banana .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it is possible , but , it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how to do it if to if it's better to put the solar cell to the peeling or outside it , or inside .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but then it must be some window there , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and something we forgot , about the speech recognition system , are we going to use it , or not ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it , it seems feasible , and it would be something very .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one of our priorities is tech technology .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we have the de design , the good shape , new and so on , and we have also the technology thing will be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and even the easy to use thing , so it will be perfect .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we add also the speech recognition device .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have decided everything .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and think we are on good way .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , the next meeting will start in thirty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the industrial manager will work on the look and feel design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the user interface mana manager will work on the user interface device .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the marketing expert will do the first project evaluation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , hope you can do that in thirty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , you should work together , you hamed and peter , to work in first prototype , and more about the shape and so on and how you can manage to put everything together .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and as usual you will receive some specific instructions on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so all everybody , and see you in thirty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}], "id": "xxxxx", "relations": [{"y": 1, "x": 0, "type": "Explanation"}]}]
