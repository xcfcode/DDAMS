[{"edus": [{"text": "i'm to be late .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "welcome back everybody .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this meeting agenda will be the detailed design meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and opening and p_m_s of the meet minutes , prototype presentation from christine and agnes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "agnes , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes and evaluation criteria .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the finance , it's from my side , from the management , and production evaluation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we have forty minutes to discuss and finalise and close the product and project and to move further , so , let's talk about first for the prototype .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so handle to so shall go to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i've done presentation , but it covers work that we've both done , so if i'm missing anything , christine can just correct me .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you did powerpoint presentation , good for you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let's go to a_m_i_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not the biggest powerpoint presentation in the world , but three .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so in two or three or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no it's t's the last one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "technical pa would think .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , then this is the la , that one , final design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it is named appropriately , you just couldn't see the name .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can have the mouse ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "alright , so from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , the material that we chose was wood , and the colour would be customisable , 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the t_v_ on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , and we've incorporated the screen on the flip panel as part of the design , if we figure out it's too expensive , then you just take it off .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so to unveil our lovely product .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is our remote control , with the flip panel as you can see .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow display .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is actually hard to do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the yellow button you have is the on off button , so it's really big , hard to miss .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have the red triangles are the toggles for changing the volume .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so up volume up , down volume down .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the green are the channel changing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it's one of those very light , very touchable displays .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the t_v_ , and on the left-hand side you have the ability to turn off the voice recognition .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is what we had on the white board the last time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and could the we haven't specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that you can really make this highly customisable remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that depends on the design of the circuit board inside and what room is left yes , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the microphone is on the top , on the middle , the under the flip .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that will be the safe , so any the chip it's not on the chip because you need to have microphone to yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , it depends on the design of the circuit board .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it shouldn't be under the flip either , because you can have the remote control closed , but you still might want to activate it by voice .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's , but my opinion it's better under the flip because whenever you want to the talk , so then you can speak then you can close it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if you put it on the flip , then technical don't t's feasible , 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if you've already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice , why use the voice , why not just use your hand ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and i'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up , just use my voice .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've got my hand in the popcorn bowl and i'm holding my cup of coca-cola in the other hand .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you don't wanna let go of either one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't wanna say .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it doesn't have to be on the flip , it can be on the side somewhere .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can also be on the side .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the sides is good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , pass this around if anyone wants to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "better you pass it around with napkin .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , because you can easily put microphone on the side that would have no problem would haven't been not be damaged or anything , and it'd be accessible all the time to voice .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's you need to work on the weight little bit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "compliments to the artist .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm fine , i'm satisfi i'm satisfied .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the shape of the buttons , the little egg shapes aren't the most economical , but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we're glad you're satisfied .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's looks more heo heavy , but when it's completely it's less weight .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is plasticene .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's only so much you can do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we could have possibly made it lot thinner as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but and part of the thing is lot of people say that they don't like something that's too light , because they don't feel like they have enough control over it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is excessively heavy , but it needs to have some weight , it needs to feel like you're still holding something .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's it for our presentation actually .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's your prototype model ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's good , very much .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so any comments or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the prototype is very within the design and ideas that we've talked about on the previous meetings .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now it goes into this next phase as the financial marketing haven't come to mine yet , so we're gonna have bit of difference of opinion , yes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , that so i'll come back to the so evaluation criteria , that will be good , so then let's come to the finance , have some calculations which made as for the budget .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so here you can look like the energy and dynamo and kinetic and solar cells .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's optional , somewhat optional and ed wants the chip on print , that's what we were talking about that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so then we have sample sensor and sample speaker , then we have the wood material , then special colour and push button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's actually , our budget was twelve point five euro , but it's coming to nine point nine five euro , so we are under below the budget , so still we are saving some money .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's good figure .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , i'm surprised .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's gonna cost long way to , cost lot of money to market it , is it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's for some money we can utilise for our marketing , for the sales , and it's not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it just depends on if we're gonna add on this pr provisionary cost analysis , we do not have l_c_ display .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "l_c_ display is gonna be very expensive , it's gonna be it's not it doesn't say .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no we do , but it's not filled in .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's number thirty .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we don't have the price up there , so if we add approximately two to three euro per remote , now we're up around about twelve , twelve and half as to what the company had initially requested .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", you're , yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that means we can put the in , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but as far as production i'm putting up question because we're talking about profit also , and in mine you'll see the problem with our survey , the possibility that how many units can be sold , what percentage of the market , etcetera because that has to be taken in into consideration .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is just production cost , it is not advertising cost , it's not transportation cost and that will inflate quite bit the cost of the cost of the unit for the company .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , so still we have twelve point five euro .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so to come up with what the company wants is fifty million pound profit , we're gonna have to go long ways .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this we are talking about one unit , so when it go into the quantity , and the cost will come down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "although customisation , because this is being done , the on on-order basis , it might be the quantity won't the circuit board will you're , would be in producing quantity , but the cost of the case would be fixed at the you got some pretty cheap labour that can do this case for one euro .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's gonna be very hard to reduce .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's not bad .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's really that's the cost of the material and lab , that's really outstanding .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but anyhow , still we are under control , so what will do is will try to negotiate with the vendors , to get the production cost less , so then we can save some money , to put into our marketing or the promotions , whatever , so that will look after .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "will speak to the management and how to get some more cost down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we can go to my display .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we'll come back to yours just to give everybody an idea of the market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so now i'm gonna scare everybody out of this project .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if i'm still here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you're in four ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the four gives me it's gotta be trendwatch .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is this the same one you did before ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it shouldn't be if it's not the one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's no , it's the same one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , no we no , that's the same one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you have to go back and find another one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "whatever name it popped up under .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "functional , try functional , it might not be it either , but we'll see .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it looks like it , there's .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we'll go screen by screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "although since we need to have some type of idea on market we had independent study that says it this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million which is approximately the same as the independent study .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if we continue , we'll look at the findings .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which means that if we have target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year , which is actually tremendous amount .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no kidding , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "mayb they already expected something .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , if we put an inflated price of fifty euro at production cost that cannot exceed twenty-five euro , we're already in that price , with transport , promotion , labour , because we hav gi included the promotion in the cost , transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we're gonna break this down between our retailers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "twenty-five percent of the market to get to two million units .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "at two million units , we have to have profit of twenty-five euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit eu euro profit .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , we did run down the evaluation of the form , the fan the fancy stylishness of the unit , the ease of use , speech recognition , cost , we've gone through these .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now , the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or we project this over two years , but being that the market changes very quickly , there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , now we have to come up with decision .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can the company sell two million units ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can it sell it for fifty euros ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "could go to findings ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would like to explore the possibility of using alternative delivery and sales channel which would be to use the internet for promotion and ordering and then to drop-ship the product to the customer's residence .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was thinking the same thing , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that way you have no storage , you have no you do have transportation , still have the labour cost , but you don't have the transport to the point of sale .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the point of sale is online .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to the agents .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can do shipping centre somewhere , or strategically place shipping centres to minimise distance costs .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should sell through amazon , don't you think ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or ebay , or yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or ebay , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's an idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "going with , we we're do , selling unique product .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to impro more profit and , yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable , 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have , see what other people have done , what the range of possibility as , whereas if you're in store , you can't unless you're highly imaginative person , you may not really it is you want , whereas on the web , if you have bunch of pictures , it can trigger ideas and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are several companies that have gone that way .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and you can even have an movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di the only thing that you're missing really is the weight .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the weight and feel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "weight , the feel of the product , but there are several that have gone through with the watches , too .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're getting used to that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's not quite like trying on shoe , but people are getting used to buying things online that they can't touch before buying .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can customise watch , you can see how it is at the end of the production , you can change it there's lot of online that's that is doing this now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and when you're rotating , you'll look behind and look this way it's possible to do with this , there's possibility of selling more than two million units in one year , which could , feasibili feasibility lower the price of the unit .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't think that's not possible , it's then , let's for the production , then you can evaluate the product , so how it looks like technically and how it look like the real .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what turnaround time do we have ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but yes it's very quick , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause production evaluation can be very quick or very long .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it will come back in two weeks , it will be ready in two weeks .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "works for me .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for evaluation , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "prototypes , you mean .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , the prototype product evaluation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in we probably should do some market tests once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test-market it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that'd have to be thrown out on the market for people to get an idea , to see get their we covered everything .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you can take minimum two weeks to maximum four weeks .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "think minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use it's not trivial task .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because we are not going to do it in our factory , so we can give it product evalua yes , yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we definitely shouldn't do it in our factory .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we'll do it in the other place , and don't t's take more than four weeks time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or , so then the real production we will start once we product evaluation , then it's approve from the technical team and your team , from the management , then we can launch in the market .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "any other questions or comments to be discuss ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , i'm go ahead .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what ab was just wondering about if we're gonna do product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad , this is bad , we want this done differently .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so then , let's take like this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did you have something ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let's proceed with this model , for the marketing direction , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so no more changes will be made , in this the basic design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we will introduce this model and let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers , then we can go for the second generation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's no end , there's not limit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the problem is there might not be second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then it may not be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "every customer , they have their own ideas , they have their own test , so there's no end , there's no limit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like people don't like wood .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , but there's difference between releasing product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit general range of requirements versus releasing product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's the reason you are here for the design , hope you made good design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , but i'm not everybody .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have our own motivations in mind , we have our own ideas in mind , but that doesn't mean that that's what's gonna sell .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but see , we ought to take few considerations , one is the price consideration , one is future consideration , like you can eat you can all eat more chi eat more chilli , so it's depends on the individual taste , so we have to balance somewhere .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm just trying to point out that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is too short you have no redesign not you personally , but in the project we have no redesign time and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "our project doesn't ed , do what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for t_v_ remote control sales ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would it be the christmas season by any chance ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the sports time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "before the eur the world cup .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which sport season ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final the launch of user-tested device with some special event .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "world cup soccer , they need those things that they have their hands occupied and they need to be able to talk to the con remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's good idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then so that gives us little more time perhaps then we anticipated , because when the world cup is , but i'm there's gonna be one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or any major sports .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or another major sports event .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "probably not the football games coming up the end of january .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that might be little too aggressive , but , so , i'm just ig pointing out strategy to do some additional user testing pri and then to launch at major sports event or perhaps to also and to work with motion pictures .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's actually good place to advertise it too .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there might be some motion pictures that are coming out that are coming out on d_v_d_ that they need to have special remote control to work with it , so we could work out campaign with sony pictures .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "some management has got relationships there we can leverage .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , the that will convince the management to do that , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's just something to keep in mind , 'cause it's really important .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "lot of products have gone out there without being properly user-tested and completely flopped , when it gets re-released few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "disposable diapers is an example of that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , it is one of the first consumer products that was launched about thirty years that was disposable consumer product , and people the market hadn't really gotten on to the concept that you could use something and then throw it away , 'cause it wasn't but then when they re-launched them thirty years later , they were virtually the same design , but people had gotten the throw-away , paper cups and napki all kinds of things that they hadn't so , you're , timing is very important , but we've got good product .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that didn't know .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the reason ed is here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "he can promote the brand value and the product value .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's gonna be very important to the company .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we are behind the scene and he is the front screen , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm the one who takes the heat .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "he's on the big screen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "good luck , ed .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it's flop , it's the marketer .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you look very relaxed , considering , the weight on your shoulders , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so then let's come to the closing and are the costs within the budget and is the product evaluated , so that will come soon .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for but our time being , so for all your efforts and work and design and let's leave it to the ed for later for once production is over and the meantime let's celebrate .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so let's meet up this evening to hang up for some party .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "working with you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "again for all .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and see you in the evening for drinks .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", see you later on .", "speaker": "D"}], "id": "xxxxx",
