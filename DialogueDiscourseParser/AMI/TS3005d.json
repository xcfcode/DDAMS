special colour ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that the wood this , we have to have that one too ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it's only half .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the only option

, po three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we need point three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's scroll wheel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't make it wood .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but

.", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's also green or , but it's special colour than just rubber colour .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it also no that that's just normal colour fruit colours .",

no , it is the scroll wheel , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but then we have to scrap display , we have to scrap advanced chip .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gonna make ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we lose the scroll wheel and make it depending dependent on the touch screen then it's possible to make .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then we have two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then we can make add two colours on it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then you can and then you can add to the colours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "two colours it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "special , if you lose if you lose the you lose this one , you got eleven point five and you make and then you can make the spec single curve , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it was such idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they can add two colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how ma the colours like she told , is the colours we add or , but we are we have yellow , red , black , titanium .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how many colours ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what do you mean ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "special colours , all the colours you want , because you want to make , but when you use more than one colour , it's special colour .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour , 'cause you have to add it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the rubbers alls original black .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you always lose the special colour .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you co you could make it always black , like normal remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we're gonna make it yellow red , and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "nee we also want to make ano another colour .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , because we have more colours than only black .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have to make this like four or five .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's what it means .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but isn't it per remote that you pay ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then don don't think they me mean they're special , true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is it per remote ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you pay half per remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", and you one colour per remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so each remote with special colour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so then it is one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you don't need four of those four of those special colours in one remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "true , true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have two points spare .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the battery , we have advanced chip on print .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "nee one point .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it would be curved , single curve .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because of thing , you can at least make it curved again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you just can't make remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because that was very important , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's too bad for the speaker .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's curved , it's still that so we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should we change that tha that that's one if not , or not ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we dropped the scroll wheel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "could you

, and then copy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "add it copy page .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , but you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright , something went wrong .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but this new remote we can afford .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it doesn't work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it should've work .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you had this list at start ?",

line .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "bon chance no , add .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and move back to here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "too bad , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then all green .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "looks like ipod .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you can erase that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's bit weird .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now i'm line .",
