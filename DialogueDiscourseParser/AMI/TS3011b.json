cancel it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "during my work have no time either .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is life .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "opened the c_d_ rom box .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it's alright .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "people , welcome back with the second meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for now on the schedule are few points .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first of all the opening , which we are doing now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "second , received some new project requirements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm not if you received them as , but will tell you about it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then the three of you prepared presentation , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we'll do your one as la the last .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the top goal of this we will figure that out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you can't upload your presentation from here , believe .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ca can you try to , we will see .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if it if it's wireless could just put it in the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't t's wireless here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it is , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or it is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the top goal of this meeting is to reach decision on the product , on the target group and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have forty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the new project requirements , first of all , we didn't speak about it , but we should not support teletext in the remote , because our board feels that teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we are not even going to try to implement it in our product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's board decision .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not feasible , it's not we cannot make it because of the time to market that we have to deal with .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than forty , which is important for you , ruud , and as for roo .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because the product should be interesting and should be bought by people younger than forty .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then for roo , as important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the colour colours and the slogan do have to be in the product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that clear ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "any questions on these requirements ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the individual presentations , roo or sebastian , who of you would like to start ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how can geez , and sli and show .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just press it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous discussion .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is to send messages to the television set .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that was the main important thing what remote control should do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then found two different remote controls , the multi-function remote control with many possibilities , but the lack of the feeling already mentioned in the previous discussion .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the ease-of-use remote control with the less possibilities but feeling in touching the buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my personal preferences were ease of the easy to use remote control , because the user-friendliness and it can be more trendy in user design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but your new goal was for people than less than forty years old .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the multi-function can be implemented in our design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it should be combination , but teletext buttons are not in our design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it should take out , eight buttons or so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but my in my opinion , the easy to use r_c_ is the best possi possibility for us .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ruud , did you get that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the important thing here is in the market , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it's also ruud's insight in the topic .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what does the market want ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", we will we all .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just for user desi user friendliness should choose for the ease of use remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's still the thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "all this device has to do is send messages to t_v_ set .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the most easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to t_v_ set .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "tried to implement picture here , but it's hardly readable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can you see it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , it's not visible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's energy source here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and there it's connected to three things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the user interface connected to chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using infrared light , which are sent to the receiver .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and there's little picture , just for your imagination , how device like this should look or can look .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what have found .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "usually these things consist of battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's cased together , nothing more than that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's almost every piece of equipment every piece of every t_v_ set is controlled infrared .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are some exceptions , but most of all have infrared controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the more luxury remote controls have lithium buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that's what we yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the glow in the dark concept we discussed .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in the and it's little more little bit more fancy also .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we should consider that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have basic scheme of the things which are implemented .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is all there is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's just one chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are few buttons connected .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the buttons are lit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the whole thing is transmitted by infrared li diode , and there is not power source here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's the total design of this piece of equipment .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's nothing more to it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's fairly easy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's fairly easy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's been done many times before , and we should succeed in our plan to do this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "succeed in it also .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , so personally we should infra use infrared , because otherwise our device cannot communicate with almost every t_v_ set .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that should be clear .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "another important point is we really should use energy sparse , friendly components .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are specially designed energy-friendly components which consume far less power than conventional components .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if we want to use rechargeable design or energy-save design , we should really implement them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for cost-effectiveness , we should really use very low-cost circuit board , because most of the production cost are in this part of the equipment .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the money we save on using this we can use for elaborate fancy lighting techniques , blinking leds and all that fancy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "our users will really like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and what's the if we use the leds , does it use much more energy or .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , they're power friendly leds also .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we can use them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's no problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for the same costs , it's can be in our combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , they're little bit more expensive , but by making we can make its .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you could only lit the buttons that are used most .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , the channel switching .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or , true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the question is whether two or four buttons makes such difference in the costs if you already plan to include fancy lightning techniques , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in the device that shines on all the buttons , and not for , but not for each button one led , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's not one light , it there are more lights in mobile device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , this should be it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have think about it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "mine is already outdated .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we ar we are very curio curious to what the market will feel about such product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "since , make then i'm the target market is ten million units .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so any income is welcome .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "of which we should sell about forty percent to make the five million .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "could you step little bit more to the ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but since the other part is forty percent of the market , thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but since the requirements changed , that's not good idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's this till true , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that they only use ten percent the buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the buttons to zap are used the about fifteen hundred times , when the power button is only used one time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the volume button's only four times .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so they're obv the most important buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we might want to build in feature to support them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "some audio signal .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like home phones .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or find finding function , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's definitely interesting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's quite yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it separates our product from others as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , this obvious , and he also said it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's what the market tells us .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's about it , yes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the volume and the zap buttons are the mostly used .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "mo zap buttons most .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , should just have design the perfect design for those only those buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "volume , they are use lot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but more than all the other buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , that's problem .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , we should focus on that , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the technical there are no technical difficulties .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's no elaborate technique used in this equipment .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so don't think we have any hiccups there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we can fully concentrate on developing product that is really what the market needs .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's good idea to think about these buttons and sound signal .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the sound signal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just one thing i'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute the sound ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's bit of that's problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "another device is not solution .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like clapping in your hands , like turning on and off the lights .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it should be , but you'll get some new technologies for it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there are some devices who incorporate this technique already .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are video sets and they have special button , the find the remote control button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you press it and your t_v_ set starts to make weird sound , and your remote controls then start to beep .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "reports rep respend response to it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just like the phones the but t_v_s don't have all buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , that's it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , same thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , because we do not have home .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , so we should use something else .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you , and usually and even if the t_v_ set would have such button , you would have to walk to your t_v_ , and it's and so if you'd be watching movie , it would constantly beep .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but believe you will have an i'm convinced sebastian will find one solution for us .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we do not control the t_v_ set so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , so we should think about it's quite complicated .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what about the clapping technique ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because you se , you see it lot in light lightning , peak .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's quite complicated .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , which is generated few times within certain period of time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but there are many other sounds which are exactly the same from the point of view from remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , so we don't want that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we can have just home stat base station next to the t_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can something like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just little antenna or something .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you lost don't think people would bother walking to the t_v_ and press that button because they lost the their remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is there not something more easily , don't think .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's just base station next to the t_v_ is the best possibility .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , and the most important thing for people is that there's central point to which they can go and perform some .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then the remote control reports itself , so we should use have we should use something like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you do not want another device , which can be everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , something like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that will be very costly , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's not good idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we do agree on the thing that the remote should have such function , if it's possible within the costs and all that things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "sebastian should have detailed look later on and come up with solution , because that's his field of expertise .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but before do that want to warn you that by implementing this function the technical design will become more complicated and it will become more costly also .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because there will be additional components which will be used .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and there are some implepe imp , so , because when you have newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and do we even prefer the sound above the leds , the lightning function ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's unique item it will be an unique feature of our remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's distinction in the market .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's different exactly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's an uni an unique feature , and it's worth looking and probably more interesting than the lights .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and just about the user interface , came up with an easy remote control and an advanced remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what should we choose in design ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "according to ruud , people do not use all the extra features very often .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the extra functions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have the numbers have the numbers here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we won't support teletext which was the third-most the second-most used function .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we do have wise board , so i'm not questioning that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "channel selection is the most important .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so on the relevance scale the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we skip that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it just the basic functions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we don't have to use it for d_v_d_ players and all .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's out of the question .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just through the easy design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we should go for the easier one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can make design when there's not mu much buttons in it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so just few buttons , trendy design , lightning effects wh and the sound .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we should save costs by not implementing lot of functions and the money that we can save from that we should use for having design and thinking about the user interface and , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ruud , how do you feel about that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you agree , do you think the market would respond to simple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we include other innovative functions then they might , 'cause young people like new features .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so and if you use that stick for volume control and channel selection , you have the two most important functions in one button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it there's another possibility .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can make it look like an easy piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , because it has many functions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's more important to make the make it look like very friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but nevertheless .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but are we not in the manual if you have few buttons , no display , it's working with shift functions and one button can but how does the remote report give back to the user in what state it is ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was more thinking about more elaborate way of controlling , by these kinds of sticks like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it's user-friendly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's your field of expertise .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because we do not implement user history .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that the system .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "know , but if we use like stick , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can use light for that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when you move the stick to position , light next to it can lit up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i've just pushed the button , or changed the channel or turned up the volume .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "something like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we could have other buttons for the advanced functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but does it then should just use instead of the stick , like many cell phones , just round , should we just use it's already , we have blank .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "draw it on the board .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "something like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's not really stick , but yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's just an easy way of round button what which can be pushed in four directions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "instead of stick .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "stick is vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down or just round button should be the trick , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it can break down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and yes , and this also looks more fancy , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it will attract more public , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you're the marketing man .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it attract younger people because new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "volume and something like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the programme up and down .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the vol , the pen doesn't really does what want .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we still we're still in the question of putting in advanced options .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ruud just told us the market is interested in some advanced new techniques .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "however , keeping it simple is important for the costs and all those things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we need to find balance between the advanced techniques and the user-friendliness .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but our next step to look at is just that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so don't t's we have something to do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can't discuss it now , because no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for we do have to decide this meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we need to have the user function the functions decided and our target audience .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but teletext is so is just scrapped .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you want list of functions ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you want an explicit list ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which incorporates all function available on the device ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do not want full it's not necessary to have full list , but want the functions , the most important are volume and programme selecting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the ten digits .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", that that's what we should think about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how is the remote going to look ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and just one function .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not in the user interface , but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the programme to programme button , the switch to two channels , when you have something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which can change .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "bit of split mode .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "dual channel watch .", "speaker": "A"},

writing it down in the last mielsen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "put all the minutes make into the shared folder .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if you want to have look at it , where to find it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but make sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's if you want to do it , sebastian .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our b_s_c_ w_ the ten digits ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", so volume .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and do we want the ten digits ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , that's important .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you want to go to channel ninety and you have that button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm not so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's complicated , but is that so relevant ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because don't think but you should shou you should know that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wouldn't buy it personally .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it were so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "remote control without the ten digits .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "imagine when you're when you have satellite decoder and you have , about six hundred channels , imagine you want this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the most just elder people would buy it , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , and if we and if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but if you're regular t_v_ user , and you just want to watch the dutch television networks , you can use about ten buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we do have thirteen different dutch channels .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the older people only use five of them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but how often do you watch all these channels ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so and there are some numbers about speech recognition here that younger people would like it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , you're probably .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but these ten buttons look bit dull .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't you think ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it depends on the looks , on the you can make them very fancy by nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "on the design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then there should be should done be done something specific with it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i'm do not agree exactly , exactly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you can experiment by with shape or with size or with colour , that thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it might be expensive and hard to implement , but it would be solution for .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it can be combined with the find the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so when you add speech recognition to your remote control , it's very easy to change the channel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's one thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it's very easy to find your remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's possibility , but i'm afraid it will be bit costly .", "speaker": "C"},

.", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we it it's board decision .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it should work , it sh we should manage that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we have to make decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find the remote control button remote control function .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's big advantage , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's only one disadvantage by implementing this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the power saving will be bit more difficult .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we can expect that there will be less longer life to the batteries .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but can we can mething smart about it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are some hybrid devices which incorporate solar panel and rechargeable batteries .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so when you just leave the device in light room , it charges itself .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but can we manage it bu for the costs ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have to do nothing for it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if we could inc include cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be big problem .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because it seems like very is cradle very cheap ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "twelve dollar fifty .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll have to find that out .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so no , that's very cheap .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's , it's very cheap .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's no problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's just case with two metal contacts .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "know , but there should be an adapter as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's yes , but they're mass production .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they're very cheap .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it will cost us practically nothing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have about ten minutes left this meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would like to hear you all have things not spoken about , but that are important .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ruud , you came up with the voice recognition data .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are there other things about the market we should know ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we dealt with the most important information .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just that the younger part of the market isn't the forty percent we want to sell to .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we should for least bit look at the older people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but with buttons like that , which are easy to use , we might attract them too .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so don't think that's big problem yes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so although we are focussing on younger people to make it profitable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we , we still need to take in account the bit older people .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have nothing to add , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "nothing to add .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "want to make summary of all things spoken and the different possibilities .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we've decided to implement seemingly easy design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so on the outside it looks easy , but we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's one the those are the choices we have to make .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but there's big advantage in making it more elaborate by implementing speech techniques , voice recognition , that these kinds of things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it makes it also more attractable , to our audience .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement fancy techniques , which our customers will like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the disadvantage is that there are some concerns about the costs and the things like battery lifetime , energy saving .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not implement these buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we just add chip which does the voice recognition , our circuit board will become even more cheap .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's another , it wa it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that was the main issue , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and this even makes it more cheapy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the cheaper the ch the chip or what was it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the circuit board .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the circuit board .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the fewer buttons you can use on it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the fewer buttons you have , the ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , it's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's the other way around , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it's very cheap to incorporate an integrated circuit , chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's another advantage .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it shouldn't be big issue .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we should just take look at the costs and especially for the voice recognition .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so yes , because yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it can be costly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm not how we'll determine the costs , will have look at it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you will get some information on that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm not how that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , al hope my personal coach will have lo look at it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we're qui quite done .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're done , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for now we will have the lunch break .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm how long the break will be , but we'll find out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work , and i'm your personal coaches will assist you with it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "will put the minutes made in the project documents folder .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you want to look at it , just do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the interface designer , would like to the next meeting would like to receive the components concept .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "roo , from you would like to see i'm , i'm .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "user interface designer , roo , would like to see the user interface concept .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , it should be easy , that's what we concluded .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis decisions sebastian makes .",

one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , some fancy lights .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's what we decided .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we drop the voice recognition ?", "speaker": "C"},

we decide next meeting ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can decide the next meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because i'll have some updated info on that adapt .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "all of you have updated info .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm the marketing expert will receive you will do some trend watching .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and i'm the market will change , adapt and
