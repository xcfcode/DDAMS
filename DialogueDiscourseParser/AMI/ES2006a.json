[{"edus": [{"text": "so , this is first meeting of this design project .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and like to show you the agenda for the meeting , if it was sent round to all of you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "didn't receive it yet .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "anyway , this is the plan for today's meeting is firstly just to introduce the project briefly , although i'm you've actually got some of the information already .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other little bit more .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the course of the design project and the meetings , specifically the whiteboard over there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then that's it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we've got twenty five minutes to do that , that's until eleven twenty five .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so any questions ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is not at this point .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not at this point .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this is our project .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what we're aiming to do is to create new remote control for television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's the functional design of the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we're going the way we'll do that is to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to work on that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then the detailed design will come after that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we'll pull it all together .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm bit confused about what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it just more detail , as understand it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it we're talking the functional design is more your area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control and what specific things it has to do but the conceptual design is perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and that thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how it will be done .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so whe where do we identify the components of our product ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's just brief overview of the project itself .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what i'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for the project , specifically the whiteboard .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so each person in turn , i'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "why are you looking at me ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would you like to go first ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do have choice ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "things falling everywhere .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", put them in pockets .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you don't have to hurry , we've got plenty of time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , my name's cat and i'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's got no eyes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the eyes always ruin it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what do it's eyes like ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is rabbit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it might be cat .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "origi at first it was going to be cat .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't t's furry enough , so we'll make it fluffy rabbit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now understand now , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "see by the ears .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", it's fluffy rabbit , blue .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "rabbits don't come in blue but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and like it because it's small and it's fluffy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "excellent , and what's your role within the team ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "am the need my notebook , top banana .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", am the marketing expert so like i'm gonna be doing the according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user requirements specification of the functional design , trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and more about yourself , you're from ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm from leicester , second year .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what else do you want to know ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like sports , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning and not with rabbits , no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but not with rabbits .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and vets , like vets as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and like cocktails , especially pink ones .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "excellent , to match the rabbit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so my name is maarika .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "where's the pen ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there's an if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", or make it smaller .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so i'm the interface designer in this project and my favourite animal , i'm not so because i'm not so very familiar with all kinds of animals , but do like dogs .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there are different kinds of dogs , but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's not bad .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it looks like dog .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is bit more impressive than my rabbit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it needs four legs if it's gonna walk though .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it has some colourful patches , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the other legs are on the other side .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's compared to some other animals like cats .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they're really much more fun because they are not so independent .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the fact that they protect their home as , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what it has to do with my role in the project is hard to say .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "hope to be loyal to the project and not to let people doing similar projects know the details of our project , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and where are you from ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm from estonia , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so is there anything else you'd like to know ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", my roles , so in the different stages of the design , so at first will be responsible for , designing the technical functions of the remote control then in the conceptual design stage need to come up with interface concept and then in the last stage will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll do some i'll rub the features and let the drawing stay .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my name is gaurav .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my favourite animal one of my favourite animals is cow .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i've got no idea how to draw cow .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is going to be , that'll do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they're not just like big round body and then some really skinny legs and then just some horns .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so let me draw the body first .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "big , round body , really skinny legs and they've got long tail and long face .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it looks like eeyore .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and there is some grass there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is what like about cows that they just keeps sitting there eating grass , they do not disturb anybody they're buddhist in way .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "horns , draw some horns .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , like cows .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my role in the project is the industrial designer , so i'm supposed to design all the details of the product ho how it works and whatever it'll take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it during the conceptual design , what are the various components of it and finally , i'm not too what was the last part .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the detailed design , it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm from india .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm doing my p_h_d_ in psycholinguistics , sit at the department of psychology .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now it's my turn .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that doesn't look like cow , does it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it looks very cute .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like the cow .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like dogs too , but 't do that already because 't draw dog as you can .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is that lizard ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is there difference ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is ar are they also like lizards or are they , they are .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they're , they're it's lizard .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and like geckos because they remind me of warm places and , and where was living in cambodia they used to live in my house and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "hope you don't like snakes , do you ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't like snakes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "come from australia and we have nasty snakes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's where i'm from , australia .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm from melbourne and i'm your project manager for today and my role is to keep things going and make that you all work together in productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with product .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , let's see what's next in the powerpoint presentation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , i've just thought i've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as there we go .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you click on it you can , was looking at the website , and the other things that they've made and like put down some like inspirational words like that got from looking at the pictures .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is the overall budget for our project .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we've got we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five euros each .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and with that we're aiming for profit of fifty million euros .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that's selling them on the international market , not just in the u_k_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and half euro so that we can reach that profit target .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's something to keep in mind while you're designing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is let me just skip ahead to see that's the last thing , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we've only got couple of minutes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about what we're thinking of this remote control ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm just wondering whether there is like any special feature that we want to have want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's probably something that it's best if we take away with us , but if we all have think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be included in this remote control that are out of the ordinary .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in the beginning one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be trendy , user friendly and original so your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the motto is we put the fashion in electronics and so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so i'm thinking , like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so something heading towards that , so it's not overly what most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so figure how many do you need , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so perhaps some menu-based thing , or .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "something that's little less crowded than this , like , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your t_v_ , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but what do most people do ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , and then they turn it off again .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there is lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , but will be used ten percent of the time , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "sometimes they play movie .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , to do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , no .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it could be one button for menu , if you really need to go and do that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then use the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , if you're the sad case that knows how your remote control works , then that's fine and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and if you can put it up on the thing but it is just like long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "haven't had look yet , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "any other immediate thoughts before we move along ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can aim for we can think about all these little things , but we can aim wi that gives high battery life , although don't think that it's huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , every now and then you need to replace the batteries .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but even though it has to be re original we shouldn't go like too far away from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have lot of problems with learning , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "big learning curve , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , it should fit in as , and the stereotype of .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's like those fancy websites that you can't access because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im you're looking at the working design , you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification , like you said at the start .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll see you in half an hour .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "carry the laptops back again .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do we need to unplug things ?", "speaker": "C"}], "id": "xxxxx", "relations": [{"y":
