"there's minus two times here , because this is the most important point .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is two times as less important , and same for this one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "technological innovations , that's regarded very highly too .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "such as an screen , speech acknowledgement , as we talked about earlier .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we

people say , that's real concept .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these are the new colours of this year .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it must be very bright , very colourful .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "people like this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we have to think in this direction .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so set your mind to it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fruit and

.", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "am going to tell you something about the components design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "again have put up the specification properties .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this so the different components of the device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the materials ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have heard several things , so i'll have to change that on the way .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the case ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "suggested in the previous meeting hard plastic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but as you indicated it should be strong .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should change that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it should feel strong .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so plastic is not sufficient .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should move to something .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it is , but it doesn't look strong .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so but we still have to look at our price .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "hard plastic is pretty tough , but it doesn't have really tough look .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because if we want an window etcetera ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we'll return to that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the buttons rubber , everyone agrees .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and electrical cables , copper is all pretty basic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the chips made of silicon , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the best way to do it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and infra infrared led is just simple bulb .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then i've had few findings , made few findings .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the target audience product style .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's generally the case that senior and wealthy people above forty five years old like , as you said , particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that's not our things this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is things we must not do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then we have young and dynamic people , which is our group , the people we aim at .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "under forty five years old .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they like soft materials with primary colours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "soft materials is agai again bit contradiction with our material choice of what you said , that it should be hard an and strong looking .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but they like soft materials , so we might we have to consider that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also they like curved round shapes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so not too formal like the older people want .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if also finding but not very ap applicable here , that sports and gaming devices such as discmans for jogging and that those devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but since we don't have really sports or gaming device , so we don't really have to consider that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "sports , they're that are accessible on your window ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also have several examples of styles , so you can get clear picture of what .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "all the results ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we keep coming back to the fronts .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these are the basic older peoples' .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it was not very interesting , very classical looking , but that's not what we want .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have these things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what exactly they are .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it looks like you recognise the shapes , it's very primary colours , bright colours and round shapes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you also see this device , it's not very round and fruity .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it that's true .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and round shapes , primary colours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can see it all here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and this famous device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as something some devices like this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so to give you an idea of this has strong look .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "t's got strong look , this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "although it's plastic , it's grey to give it iron look .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it still has strong look .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it's round .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then you are losing your fruity colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have to make can't really make round remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can make that middle ring can you can make another colour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so those things you can combine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't think that's very practical , but it's important to think about the colour .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , it isn't .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because if we make it grey or silvery looking , it does make it lot more does make it looking lot more stronger .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the but it doesn't have to look strong .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause if you look at this , it doesn't look very strong , becau but this is plastic , and this too , but the feel ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the results are , the feel of the material is expected to be strongy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , if you ti you should have some coloured titanium .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it doesn't have to be strong , also .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "nah the feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "only the feel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it looks pretty but it feels strong .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then have some more findings .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "about the energy source of the device , suggest the basic battery .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "got some other energy sources .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but solar energy is not very practical inside house , because you don't have lot of sun .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and kinetic and dynamos are not very practical , for simple remote , that's bit , that's bit much .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also suggest as shape double curved case .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the disadvantage of that you can use no titanium .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that that's the information received .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you use the curved case , curved case , double curved then you can't use titanium .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what do you exactly mean with double curved ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now this to give it more modern look .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and now the shape , curved case .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "more modern look not plain , long box style , but i'll draw it , but later .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it mean , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it makes it gives it more user friendly shape , than if you have .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "anyway as for the buttons , simple push buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no otherwi no difficult scroll things or some things like that , because it makes more complex and expensive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , as we , we don't use speaker or sensor or speak speech controlled device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because it makes it also more complex and expensive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we do use an screen , so we do have to consider of we have to use more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it's worth the trouble , because rubber is soft material , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this soft material thing from .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the buttons can be made of an soft material .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because people like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's what want to talk about .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we will take that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then mike ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "nah the method we will include the buttons as we discussed earlier .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "an screen will be implemented .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we must decide where , this meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there are new developments in speech recognition systems , and they are already being used on coffee machines .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and they're cheap , so we could use them now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's not really speech recognition , it's more like you can talk to the chip , record the message and record an answer , and then once you talk to the remote , then he will answer with the prerecorded message that you left .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if say hi mike , and you have recorded hi mike back , then you will get that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no it doesn't does not do anything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it's just it's cheap .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's bit yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that makes it cheap .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's just an extra function , and it's cheap .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it has no functionality for our remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no but , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no but that's the gadget they want , or the gimmicks .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it it's for young people .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "young people love them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , we should really include that one , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they like gadgets .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it's cheap .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as said earlier the screen should be positioned at the lower end of the remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the buttons for screen width and general settings and that we can also do let that functions be shown in the screen , instead of extra buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you put menu in the ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "young people and every user would like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the buttons should be positioned the same way as they are on , conventional remote , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for the learnability and to keep it recognisable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "voice recognition can be implemented .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and drew an example , but it did not work quite the way wanted it to do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can you draw it now of can you draw it now ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how do you give input to the menu on the screen ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have the draw it again , and did wrong .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "didn't tick the note bo box in the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "with the up and down and buttons and the will draw what had drawn on the screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you have menu button , and then you can go up and down .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but then we should also have an button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "shall draw this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it works .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just there is already blank .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have to push hard .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "suggest banana shape .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because of the fruity fashion .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no next year that's out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yellow and , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "these little buttons are bit difficult to draw correct .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "those are the cha the channel buttons ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just the numbers .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then below is the screen ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "these will be bigger in the real design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this must be the button used to interact with the screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and with this you can , yes , go to through the menus and that can the video button should be an apart button , because you want it to , to use it fast within one click .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and what's the menu button ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you need speaker .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this button can also be the menu button , we use in the menus we can add another button here , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but how did how do you get out of the menu then ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you could just do an exit with .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "by pe pressing the menu button again .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "by pressing the menu button again , you go out .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , but bec because when you push menu you get in , and then you have to push when you get to choice .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's usual the way it works .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you no , we should add extra menu button and this the button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that's also the button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you can men you can press menu again to get out .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's you should have or you can put in the l_c_d_'s window an option get out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "once you have an extra menu button , you don't need that extra option .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's just choice .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have redundancy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we need recording button for the speech part .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or don't , and spea speaker at the back , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we decide to implement that , we should .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "why would you put it then , and where is the recording the microphone ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "where would you put it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they that could be anywhere .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's very small .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it could be down here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that's just little gap .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the speaker and the microphone , are the same little hole thingy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we could do , but it's perhaps more expensive , the speaker on the back .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are all already being implemented in coffee machines , so they won't be very expensive .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but this is my suggested design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then let's have look at the decisions we are going to have to make .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and as you can see so , the screen does look better at the lower end , or at the bottom .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , had some examples .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "live with it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can but did not like it very much , but these are quite obvious , very ugly remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they do they don't look fruity enough .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "nei they're not trendy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they're all black .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that one like .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is for children but no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "tho those but it doesn't the , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it doesn't look strong .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but with the colours it's bit the way we're going to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is terrible this looks .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is just crazy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's all too much buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it must not look too childish ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "too many buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's , that's too expensive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this these are the screens .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we should , if it's possible , one with colours , but too expensive ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "nah it's too expensive .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ha , even more .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is what we've just done .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but are we going for strange form ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , not very strange .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause people like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not too strange .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not too strange .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can make the underside , you can make it more round , where the is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it still has yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it falls over the hand .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if the no nokia telephone , with the round thing at the bottoms , something like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have at home remote with bridge .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's just half round half circle at and then it falls exactly over the hand , and that's very .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's it feels comfortable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but people like something new .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "will design it , we design it later .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we'll get to that later .",

sources .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "got this from our friends .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the conceptual design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "these are few examples which we have to decide about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "all the materials from the case , the electric cable that's all your side of the story .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now from the user interface , your package ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "where no , that's more like the buttons where they have to come .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and bit of , bit of design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we should decide now .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , but we have to decide about these now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "materials are the most , most impor .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the trend-watching .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so as you said , fruity is in , sells good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we have to put it in one document .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if we go through them why should .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "copy paste this story into word document , and then put the answers after the subjects .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have to decide all these things ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but all these examples are of coffee machine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can override them ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what properties should it have ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "suggest what do suggest actually ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we why don't we use titanium or hard , some metal for the whole remote except the front .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do the new no the front is the most important .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that just like most cell phones are .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we have titanium .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the non-removable elements of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium , to give that strong look .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then the front is made of plastic .",

.", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "any colour , then you paint it in the colour you want it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the plastic is the colour you want it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , we're
