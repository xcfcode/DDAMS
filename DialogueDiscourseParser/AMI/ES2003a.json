you're going to be the user interface , is it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "user interface defin designer , yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is the agenda for today's meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as you can see , opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we already got through opening , and partially through acquaintance .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , the reason we're here , we're gonna design new remote control , as you probably all know .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "course , we'll have to go into bit more detail than that , but personally that the original is gonna be very key aspect to this design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's lot of remote controls out there anyway , so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is how today seems to be going to work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're gonna have the three phases , as you've probably already been told , the functional , architectural , and the detailed design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "first one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec , technical functions , working design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "second seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials , and the last one is detailed analysis of our design so far .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you've all got the similar emails , believe , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what can say ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ebenezer , you wanna have you wanna draw your favourite animal ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "will make this quick , since we don't have much time .", "speaker":

"speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also , elephants have very good memory , much like myself , and 't remember back when used to live back in nigeria , but used to have pet elephant .", "speaker": "C"},

bit of artistry ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", you can clip them to your belt .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you ga the little the that's good , we can clip them on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do we take them off ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you should also have your the lapel mic on as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there was this microphone as that you just somewhere so .", "speaker":

big , they're biggest cats , did project on cats in the wild when was kid and it was my favourite cat , just 'cause it was looks the best , the stripes , orange .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "my dad used to talk about he's from bangladesh so he used to tell me all about them when he was when was kid .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and they're just the most feared of animals in the wild .",

of view of the study of human evolution they and other primates are terribly interesting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so like monkeys .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and thi this one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "hardly what i'd call the best drawing in the world but it'll do for now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "also not quite as feared as your average tiger , but cats are one of my favourite animals , they're very independent , they're snotty as hell at the best of times , and , what can you say , you got to love those qualities in an animal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we've all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it , so , on to it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as you can see , twelve point five euros per unit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's not terrible lot as far as i'm aware , and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we're aiming for fifty million euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that was profiting , that was an amount , so that's the amount made , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "fifty million , and if you're making twelve point five euros on each one , then , awful lot need to be sold .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now we better actually just get on with the meat of the project .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so i'm gonna that we've all used remote controls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "any ideas of where you think new remote control could go into this market ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one thing i'm aware of is , there at the very high price end of the market there's emerging market for touch screen remotes that can be programmed in much more sophisticated ways than conventional models , so you get the you get you can redesign the interface to your own needs , you can programme in macros , and you get much greater degree you get in these three in one , five in one , whatevers , but you can get integration between the different the diff the different things that it's designed to control , to much greater extent , and you can have one macro to turn the t_v_ to the channel , get the re rewind the tape in the v_c_r_ and get it to play once it's rewound , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it occurs to me there might be niche for remote that aimed towards some of that functionality but using just conventional push button design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and therefore putting it into much lower price bracket .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", tha that's true , with the price range we're looking at , going for touch screen would probably be possibly out of our .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you think again something to control multiple units in simple fashion .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wouldn't like to say you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , but something that could operate between multiple units in more integrated fashion .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "some and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for running macros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the t_v_ , the sound system as , all in one go , is that , that sounds like good strong idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let's say , or you pr you press say the play button for the d_v_d_ player and it turns the t_v_ on and onto the channel as , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i've noticed that gaming is becoming quite popular with television , when was younger we used to play games using our cable , using the cable subscribed the cable providers , but our remote controls would get worn out really easily , and the remote control was not keyboar , keypad , for playing games .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "any takes on this ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so perhaps one that was more specialised for game playing or interactive television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they they've recently brought out this new remote control , for people to set their favourite channels , or to record things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "instead of people entering in what time things start , you simply stri slide bar to say what time it begins , and slide another bar to say what time it ends , that's , it's taken out the you don't have to be really clever to use remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've heard i've seen the bar-code design before , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for gaming , you want some big buttons for up , down , left and , shoot .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television , so you need buttons to change the television angle , the camera angles and like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'re beginning to run out of time now , so , we've got couple of ideas , we can we'll have to work fast , alright as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting , so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality , how the user interface might work , that'll be key aspect especially if the idea of some macros facility because you have to program it , you have to have lot of response back , or at least some kind .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we're gonna try and have to figure out what the user wants , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what the user wants .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "has anybody got anything they'd like to add at this stage , anything they think that might have been missed so far ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "when you're talking about gaming and , do you think they should have some stick on it , rather than buttons ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like control pads , of games , but or is that bit ridiculous ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't see why not , almost everybody is probably used to console by now , and all of them incorporate small keypads on them , even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as , so it's probably an interface that most people are used to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that could allow easy navigation , used as joystick as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the other key feature that would be good idea built into it is to make something fairly ergonomic , something that just fits as comfortably as possible into the hand .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , al also allows for the possibility of more slightly unconventional or attractive sha shape for it overall , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , small , stylish , and something that's just little different .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "something sl slightly biomorphic in form , which it would need to be to conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's definitely something that we should be able to do quite easily .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would have hoped so anyway .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'd say we finish this one up , we get started , i'll get in , i'll write up what we've quickly done , and i'll get that out to everybody .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as far as i'm aware we leave the
