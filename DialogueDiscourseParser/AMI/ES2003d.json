to go ahead with this in going for plastic solid case , to keep the ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one thing , ho how much extra would it be to keep the articulation ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's hard to tell .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would say that you're at least gonna take double curved , and even then i'm not quite if that's incorporating the idea of articulation .", "speaker":

needed is up here , to put to keep the joystick in good ergonomic position for it to have it rest on the top of the hand .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we wouldn't actually save lot by reducing it

?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's voice recognition , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , battery definitely , it looks like it unless we can manage to put it in under point two euros , .",

of three .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's this would be in the middle .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we it's not bad .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's in the good section .", "speaker": "C"},

this in , to have positive , even based on the four of us being heavily biased , it was gonna be quite hard to get anything standing out i'd say possibly , based on the cost features .", "speaker":

bit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "even if we gave this one seven and this one seven , that's still only three extra points over seven .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's , we did it was .",

out twenty five euros that's only marginally good ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it depends who your who's what the target people are , like you'd say the fashion conscious women would be going , look at that , 's , it looks like it's yellow , looks like banana , it's gotta look good in the sitting room .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's been targeted hide it in the fruit basket .", "speaker":
