[{"edus": [{"text": "welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and it looks like we've done good job here and we'll just go through the final details .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the minutes of the last meeting we'll take those as read , the next thing we we'll have look at the have look at the prototypes and look at the evaluation criteria and finance and then just tidy up with production and then we can close .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if you'd like to present your proposals .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have the same kinda lay-out here it's just you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the shape of your hand , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "on the left we've got the scroll for the volume , on the we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and push .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is the power key , it's kinda like the biggest so how to turn on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the little menu key .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is the infra-red section so you it'll be sending rays and if you're pointing it like that it can send it , or if you hold it up like that it'll send it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we got microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can talk to it like that and it'll still understand .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the logo is down there and has the cover on it and you can see like it just kinda goes the red bit's the cover and it kinda goes over everything and then there's holes for the buttons to come through .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so we figured it would be light weight plastic , just light non-descript grey so that people'll wanna buy the covers and then the covers will be that rubbery material like they make ipod covers , so they kinda just stretch over .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "showing me age , what ipod covers are like .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "didn't know that but they're it's just rubbery and that way spongy like is something that people wanted and it just stretches over and that way probably helps protect it little bit too as and just kinda stretch it over and it'll just stay on and then the buttons come through and so and then the each one of on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the r_r_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it's also easier to put on versus like mobile covers you actually have to screw them on and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself and it'll be fine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "li that'll be the covers as , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "tha it's detailed point , wondered how will people put these down wonder ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for some strange re reason had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically but , no because particularly if they've dif if they're gonna have it as fashion item it it's just minor detailed point , but as you say you can just make the base little bit bigger and it just needs another logo somewhere is all it gives people the option and if say if they've got them because actually have several upon the , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it could stand , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "could broaden the broaden it out bit so it would stand like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could just widen it out .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "could have one for your stereo , one for your d_v_ player .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have to if we just lengthen it so it comes down to the base of the hand and then flatten it out and could sit there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just or just make it little .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that that's but no the overall concept is , no , that's these .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "somewhere like that so it just .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we might have to lengthen it so it kinda your hand still holds it and have it there , like that , like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "kinda had kinda natural idea where it's like more of like kinda slightly like thinner , kinda like that kinda like flower or plant for the more natural kinda , just click there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but no but the , it it's wouldn't do that , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the final product would actually stand up , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the these were all minor details , the basic concept is bang on and the it certainly meets our criteria of being of looking different .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'s little longer .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so good that's that that's excellent .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let us what's on the next one ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , let's have look at the finance .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now we're given clear design brief , if get the spreadsheet up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the maximise button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "good , this is why we need to make these things simple so that the boss can understand .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now i've this is the company's costing for various aspects of design and i've treated some of these slightly liberally given the constraints placed on us , wouldn't know for in if they require us to have it in the corporate colours , then that is not special colour , that's standard colour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're just simply on batteries , the one decision i've had to make is that we're we will have to find regular standard chip to do this with and i'm certain that they are around so , that don't serious problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the voice sensor is expensive but we made basic decision that was fundamental to the design so that has to stay .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then again the shape of the case means that it's expensive to make 'cause of the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept we should exceed the sales targets .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's simply made of plastic so that's no problem and just because the whole the colour of the whole thing that's there's some cost there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we haven't actually got scroll wheel we got push buttons and simple slider so and the buttons are do that they're special colour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "anyway the costings come in at exactly on target at twelve point five but thi we have very strong case to argue that what we've got is so in innovative and different that any slight compromise we have to make on cost is offset by the concept of it being fashion accessory and having the interchangeable covers so the if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative that they have to accept that we can't operate within the constraints that they give , so we present this as the company's way forward and we can argue that we have come in on budget .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does anybody want to andrew do you want what do you want to say about the evaluation where we're at ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the product or the project ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ll my presentation just now ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can get the cheers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "more loud clicks in the microphone .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there we go , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "method of evaluation testing the product was to just if it met all the criteria all the conditions that we set out to set out to solve , from the point of view of the consumer and the management .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what i've been asked to do is , on the whiteboard gauge our team response to these questions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , on scale of one to seven , one being true and seven being false .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "seven being round number to work to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then at the end just take an average yes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "tr on for true and seven for flase .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , look at these questions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is the device flashy and fashionable ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'd say definitely one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so and also technologically innovative ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes the voice technology .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "easy to use ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't see we could've made it any easier .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "suitable for the consumer ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it made we met all of the consumer wants .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is it complicated ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "doing pretty so far aren't we ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "where are we ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we've built in the speech , where are you , function .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "does it take long to learn to use ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , not .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , what else ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the r_s_i_ compares to the current standards , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "less buttons so it must be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it is sorta the handle more ergonomically correct as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we it was our it was we made an actual effort to will device appeal to all age groups ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it will because old older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the voice bit so and it's don't think we're actually charging particular premium anyway , in the end , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's good call , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality , the ease of use of the device might make up for that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups just 'cause we have gone with the fashion focus and the younger people tend to would be more conscious of that aspect of it , but it should still appeal on certain level to everybody , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it will appeal for dif for different reasons but it's so , so we can reasonably say it's another one , why not ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just the simplicity of it and not having to learn to programme and not having million buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can you just click the my mouse to move onto next page ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and what did we make the management's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in my interpretation of management's instructions is that yes it meets the requirement is it's television only , it's simple to use , it's within budget , it's yes an any minor points we argue .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "under the cost .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we've done an amazing job in coming up with what need calculator for that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "eleven divided by eleven's one so equals average of one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that roughly concludes my evaluation of the product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "nick the cable back then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "mixed up the colours little bit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do either of you want to say anything ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ps don't , we worked together and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make and , seemed to discuss things pretty and come to group consensus and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this slide here the satisfaction with room for creativity , we've allowed ourselves as much creativity as the product allows .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "won't comment on leadership , teamwork we've everybody's worked pretty together .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens , the results speak for itself and new ideas found , again gi no given relatively everyday product , we've very effectively come up with new approach .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are the costs within budget ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is the project evaluated ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're all happy that it meets all the criteria , very much , that that's we can go for an early bath .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so call the meeting closed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not how far ahead of schedule we were there .", "speaker": "A"}], "id": "xxxxx", "relations": [{"y":
