thirteen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm gonna do an opening , talk about did you all get the minutes ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "e-mailed them to you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm also putting them in the shared folder .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so then we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll talk about the new project requirements i've just received , and then we have to make decision on our remote control functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "finally we'll just close .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're starting this meeting at approximately twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so first of all the functional design objectives .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "three presentations , you can go in any order you choose .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "shall we go in the order that you just did it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how do hook my screen up ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you might have to disconnect rose .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's wee plug just that one there that's it , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "where does it go ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm not supposed to move this , but where's function ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then you have to press function eight it is on your laptop .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "function , eight , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the blue one , f_n_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it plugged in all the way and you screwed it in and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", 's screw in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you just have to push it in really hard .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "push the screw .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright i've never attached to anything .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's taking it little bit there you go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright , so , if you are able to get access to the report that was online or if i'm the only one who is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , don't even know how to play this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "press the little presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's the it looks like y_ over there above draw .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there , that one , there you go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're just gonna talk little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "real reaction did some market research .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they had hundred subjects and their usability lab and they watched them watch t_v_ and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what they found was they analysed people's desires and needs .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "focusing on their desires , people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly , seventy five per cent of the hundred subjects noted that and that they more importantly though , eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for fancier looking remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "anything beyond what fancy means , but that's particularly of use to us , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "also they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age , so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition , whereas the older people in the like sixty and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognitions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "people also had certain frustrations , that we could try to take into consideration with our design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that being people frustrated with losing their remotes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "over fifty percent of the people mentioned that was their biggest frustration .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "people are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use remote and that ties back to what you were saying before just that there's too many buttons , it just needs to be easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it also mentioned something called r_s_i_ and was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what r_s_i_ is , because .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "repetitive strain injury .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "repetitive strain injury .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if you cheers .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "people do not like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the carpal tunnel type thing , people do not like that , the repetitive use , caused strain .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "looking at the needs people specified , the problem now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "people are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "people also zap like to change the channel , about sixty five per cent during an hour of use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings , the screen settings and the channel settings , because they're used much more infrequently and probably just complicate what's going on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that some things that we might wanna think about , the idea of an screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were , so that's coming to me later , like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but something for us to consider also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use , make that , something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used lot more often .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like , that it has fancy appeal and that it's not ugly and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it , so it doesn't give them any hand injuries or things like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'s move on to the next presentation on effects .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was that you ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have unscrewed it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "user interface , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here we go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that's in the shared , if did it , if anyone wants to look at it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "here we go .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i'm gonna talk about the technical functions design of the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we need to start by considering what remote control actually is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's device thows us to produce certain effects on our television , so it's communication device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we tell the remote control what we want to do , it sends message to the television saying change the channel , change the volume , adjust these settings , adjust the brightness .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how do we actually go about designing new television remote control ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "first thing to do is to come up with the design specifications .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we need to our final product is gonna be like , so we need clear idea of exactly what this product does , how it works , and what the end-user is gonna want from this product .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "way i'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product , and then trying to get some feedback about how these particular prototypes work , sorta find out what people think of .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "using remote control is quite subjective experience .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and different people prefer different things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should remember that remote controls are fairly standard piece of equipment .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when users using remote control , he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so in some sense we're gonna have to aim for device which is fairly conventional in design so that we're not completely shocking people .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas and to make something that's perhaps little bit different , something that stands out .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the first of these is technological ye what can we do with the current state of technology as it is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the second is economic , we need to find balance between features and price .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so as you mentioned things like voice recognition would add to the price but it would also im improve the design of the product .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so had look on the web to see if could find few examples of existing television remote controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in analysing these we can consider what things what's good about them , what things do they get , what's bad about them , what's wrong with , how we can improve on the designs that found and what can we do to make our product stand out from the large majority of remote controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "here's two examples probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on the left here we've got an engineering-based design for remote control , so it's one that's got lots of buttons , it's fully featured , everything you might possibly want to do is there , it's got forward , backwards , up , down , channel numbers , volume , freeze frame .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's fully featured and it might take while to get to learn to use it , but once you've learned it you can do whatever you want with your t_v_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the one on the is lot more basic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's just got the essential functions of the t_v_ changing the channel , play , stop , volume .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it would be lot quicker to learn to use it , but again it's swings and roundabouts .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are disadvantages , you can't use it say to freeze the television picture .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's lot of features that are missing from that remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we've got to find our find way of striking balance between the two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as said before , remote controls are subjective , different people want different things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "personally wa what want from remote control is device that's simple , it it's easy to use , it's got big buttons for doing the things do most often , changing the volume , changing the channel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it does everything that need it to , as said before , i'm quite lazy , don't wanna walk across the room just to adjust my television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also want something that looks , and that feels good , that's ergonomically designed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that was very useful .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's funny to see the drastic difference between those two remotes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and neither of them were very pretty , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that could be our selling point .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's certainly market for technology that looks .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that's why companies like apple've 've made lot of progress .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "really can't see what i'm doing , so does anyone have ah-ha , look at that , showing up already .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you there it is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , did it let you go on the internet or was that just what it let you see ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that was just on the company web site , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause was like googling and then i'm like it won't let me google .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright no , how do play again ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the it's above draw .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there are three thingy if it's way at the bottom .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "under three icons and it's the one that looks like desk .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there are y_s .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is our working design presentation .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "had bit of some issues with this , because wasn't able to find everything needed , but that's we're still in early stages .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , this is this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "though the thing about working design is the what we're trying to do as working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that coffee grinder .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans and then you put the bean through filter and that filters out , and then you get coffee at the end that's and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if i'm explaining that very , but how do get to the next .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the method as working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfil this practical function , what needs to be done and how do we convert all the elements to make that done .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so wha the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points at which you need something to happen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you make schematic of the way that the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task separately .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you just press , just click .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that'll be fine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the findings that got very just very briefly is that you have choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that 'cause you don't need sight line .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's one thing we're gonna work on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the user interface is critical here , because lot of the things that happen in remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data , which then goes through the infra-red , so the chip that ian is designing , is gonna be crucial .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and really it all comes down to the user , because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the components that we find here are the energy source , the battery or whatever that's gonna make it work , then the chip , which converts the data , the user that's controlling the chip , and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you have four main components and they are designed like this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have your energy source there which then brings energy or information to the chip , which is also controlled by the users .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip 's not what wanted to do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "use that thing you can go back , previous .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "about that , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let's just get back to my schematic here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ye double click on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with the left hand one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't show me that tip again .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there we are .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there we are .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "about this , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm pathetic with things like this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you have your energy source , your user interface who's controlling the chip , the chip also uses the energy , and the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work your infra-red bulb , which will then bring the data to the receiver .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my garbled way .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is the parts of the working design that need to be figured out .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and personal preferences , besides the fact that 't spell , we need long-lasting energy source , people don't wanna be changing it lot .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we need chip that works with the user interface , that isn't too complicated .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we need straightforward interface , like ian was saying , simple , not overwhelming it with information and we need reliable and clear infra-red signal , so that you're not waving your remote around and having to get frustrated and go do it by hands .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's it for the working design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "rose , do you think you can give me hand with this ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "never tell which way to turn these things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "lefty loosey , righty tighty , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "lefty loosey , righty tighty .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "never heard that before , that's good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll think of that every time now .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's gonna stick in your head .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's good one it'll stick with you .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have nothing on my screen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here we are .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", it's fine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have couple new requirements that was just e-mailed before the meeting and that we have to keep in mind as we're creating this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we didn't bring it up yet , or in the meetings so far , but we're not gonna work with teletext because that's been taken over by the internet , so we're not gonna worry about we're not gonna worry about that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's british thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you don't have it in the states ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "could would you care to explain it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's like suppose it's similar to very basic web browser .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have like you have numbers on your remote control , and you type in the page number you want , so like you type hundred on your remote control and this index appears on the television screen with just some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you just type numbers to go to different pages and it gives you information , mostly rather boring like what's on t_v_ next and share prices and that thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "lottery numbers and sport scores .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if you ever see the t_v_ saying like go to page one sixty on ceefax now , that's what they're talking about .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's earl it's pretty old technology .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's like nineteen eighties .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that explains lot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have no idea why we don't have it , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", we're not gonna the management has decided we're not gonna work with that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we're also gonna like your question earlier whether this is going to be for television , video , or etcetera .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just for television .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's what we're focused on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "otherwise becomes to complex , we wanna get this out very quickly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we only have short amount of time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and finally there's more marketing , our corporate image has to be recognisable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan in the new design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what's our corporate image like ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's yellow colour with we put fashion in electronics .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "looks like , yellow and black and we have that the emphasis on the r_s in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's like double .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it's , we put the fashion in electronics .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we gotta keep that in mind .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we want something that looks good and is yellow .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or ha some buttons could be yellow .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like , we can play around with it little bit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we need to talk about our functions and our target group .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we need to decide who our target group is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you in your analysis of different market of the marketing , you identified that different groups wanted different things or had certain preferences , that older people didn't really care for voice recognition , but younger people did .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so who are we aiming this at ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're gonna say that function fashion we put the fashion in electronics then you automatically , younger group that that's who's gonna be attracted to this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , do think , who's gonna have the money to buy that also , that one ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's gonna be twenty five euro remember , so it has to be avai marketable to whomever it is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes with television ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause that would affect the way that we market it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "at least now what we're doing is deciding on just the remote itself , so it will probably be sold separately , twenty five euro by itself .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the only break-down that was given in terms of age was the voice activation and there's big jump , after thirty five people don't really care if it has voice , so it's like fifteen to thirty five that think that that's good idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm gonna be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later , but if that's the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would wanna stick between the fifteen and thirty five range .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's probably population quite little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway , so that might be fairly good target group for us .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now , those are that's all specific for speech recognition .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are we gonna use that as one of our functions ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would say no , because it's gonna add too much to the price .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "especially if we are marketing it as separate product , people are gonna be paying , we've got price limit of was it twelve and half euros for to produce it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to produce it , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to produce it , yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and half euros without having to make too many other compromises .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but what else are we gonna put , not that i'm really gung-ho about it , what else you can put in remote to make it technologically advanced though .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so like other than just making it look good , how is it can look really and still have the same up-n-down buttons and why's anyone gonna buy new remote ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but why are we why are we aiming for technological advancement ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple and that doesn't necessarily mean more technology , it could use it could mean , not .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's good thing to keep in mind .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if they might be overwhelmed with remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if someone's looking to buy new remote , don't they want like an upgrade ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can look for we can look at upgrade or we can look at user-friendly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "simplification , so , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they could have crap remote that came with their t_v_ that's just impossible to use , or it broke , or they're just missing it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow or pull out of the side .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can you like this may be too complicated , but , wish had something to explain it , like if it was just simple , either this way or this way , that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out , and like you got the rest the buttons , but the rest of them like went in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the remote there are remote controls like that , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do what i'm saying ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like some t_v_s they have sliding screen on the remote control of it that hides all the complicated buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if you wanna do something complicated like programme your television or re-tune it , then you open up this little hatch or slide the screen down and there's all the special buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause then 's like people who don't wanna ever look at them , never even have to see them and if you like get the instruction manual that comes with it and you just don't even read it then you'll never even know that those things can pull out .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and you're happy person and everyone else doesn't have to have like two remotes , one that has the easy ones and one that has more complicated ones , but 's all still in one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's good idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's good idea , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have to be careful that doesn't impede the chip transmitting information , but that's gonna be mostly technological thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what are we emphasising ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what in this project ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "si simplicity and fashion .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "simplicity , fashion .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "simplicity and fashion .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "those are very good goals , that we have to keep in mind in with everything we do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "simplicity and fashion and , or usability speci however you wanna say that , which includes an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional , so that you don't have to travel around lot .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what can you do to like make the infra-red more functional , like why would it not be ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm just wondering .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's lot to do with battery , but that's just my .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the battery and that the chip takes the data and presents it , without scattering .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so 's just the quality of the chip .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the quality of all the components really , we can't really do anything shoddy work , 'cause it's gonna be visible down the line .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so our target group , we're saying , fifteen to thirty five ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how useful that number is if we're not doing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "voice recognition , which feel like voice recognition is not necessary in remote control , like it might be necessary for t_v_ but not for the remote , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's , it's pretty high-tech .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "seems little bit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it might be too expensive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if the whole idea is you're using remote then why would you have voice , like what and then it's like you wouldn't need remote you'd just talk to your t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's for , like , the ultimately lazy people , who can't even be bothered to pick up the remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if get more numbers , i'll e-mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but this doesn't divide up anything and there was only hundred subjects also , which isn't , really isn't that representative , especially if it's hundred subjects that they then can subdivide into age groups that means there's very few in each age group , so twenty to like fifty five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but regardless we're aiming for the under sixty five .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "under sixty five , that's good start .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'd say we're can we narrow it down to teenagers and families ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause that
