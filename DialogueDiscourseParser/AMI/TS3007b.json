each one of you , so not me but only you will present the things you worked on the last half hour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "will take minutes and will put the minutes that have at the end of the session in the shared folder .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now , so you can read that now or afterwards .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "had an email from the management board , if you al also received it , but there were four points which are very important .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first one is they think that teletext becomes outdated and internet will be the main focus .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "second one is also important , because it's one of the discussion points of the previous session .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television , so it not gonna it's not gonna be multi-purpose remote control , so that's one thing to keep in mind .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "second , and that's important for the marketing expert , the current customers are in the age group of forty years and older , but with this new remote they will would like to reach group younger than forty .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and to keep in mind , but not really for now is that they want the slogan and the logo to be recognised more in the remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , we have forty minutes , so not more than ten minutes per presentation each , and use all the facilities so that you have either smartboards , the word files , what you whatever you want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so tim , can you start ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have some new findings on marketing expert level , which will show you .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the method used was giving orders to our usability lab to do questionnaire .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one hundred respondents were involved and my marketing department generated report with lot of results .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these were couple of findings , first page of three .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have three audiences of two audiences , i'm .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five age .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the second one is from sixty four forty six to sixty five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent sixty five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "second audience is thirty five percent .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and some interests from the age groups , it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy new technology , like an screen on the remote control , speech recognition .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't think that's really appropriate .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and when you see the audience , the age is going up , they don't really want it anymore , at least the new technologies .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "second findings out of the questionnaire are the opinion the opinions of the audience about current remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "first point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly , and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when remote control would look fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's something for the user interface designer .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "according to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , following buttons are most important .", "speaker": "D"},

what you do with remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the second , teletext , and the third , volume controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's good that we the user want wants , at least the these three points have to be very clear .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's strange that the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be outdated by the internet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that that's strange .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", but at the moment teletext is , the best thing you can get on t_v_ , like getting information .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , when you ask people , what do they use , they use teletext and not the internet on remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's ne it it's new technology , but it's not incorporated now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "my personal preferences .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we should aim at the audience from sixteen to forty five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "first of all it's the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "second , you will get the most revenue from it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", people from sixteen to forty five watch lot of t_v_ , more than people who are el elder .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "second point , we have to impro improve the most used functions , as said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "third point that came out of the questionnaire , people used to get lost off the remote controller , so it's an idea for us to design ex placeholder on side of the , of the t_v_ where you can put the remote control in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's about it , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "when you mentioned improving functions , what do you mean by that what are you think about ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not the functions , but it came out that lot of buttons weren't even used on remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you can have remote control full of buttons , hundreds of buttons , but if you don't use them , it's , they have to be on it just to get it done if necessary , but the most used buttons have to be bigger or , perhaps .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so focusing more on the used buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "could you use perhaps one button for multiple functions , like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just for the minor functions perhaps .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ma perhaps , just an idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just to get less buttons on the remote control , to make it easier and quicker to learn .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll go , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "janus , can you , janus .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll be explaining bit about working design about the project .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what did was dissected current remote controls and viewed how they looked , how they worked , what components are involved , and how they are connected together .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and after that put up scheme about how these things are organised and i'll show it to you in few seconds .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and i'll explain bit about how it works and how we could build one and why several possibilities that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what did was checked remote controls and the remote controls of today are all infrared , not like all probably know .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the thing about that is the remote controls have to act as t_v_ or stereo , and those have transmitter that's also focused on infrared , so if we want to build remote control with bluetooth then the t_v_ should have bluetooth too in order to communicate , so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus that's that wouldn't mean cheap remote control for us .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's probably why most controls are still infrared .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "furthermore they all have very simple structure , so that would probably mean lower costs and that could mean for us good thing 'cause we should be able to build relatively cheap remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as mentioned ready , we have some bluetooth may be possible , but figured it wouldn't be possible in within our budget , but that's not for me to decide , but that's something for marketing to look into .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because my personal opinion is not to do bluetooth or radio waves , although , actually have .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what do you think about incorporating bluetooth or radio receiver in the place-holder next to the t_v_ , connected to the t_v_ ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's in the wrong product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "actually figured that would be that would be rather , but then you'd still have the infrared function .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so in theory you'd actually just move the problem , but what did think about was when you mentioned about the cup-holder , is why not introduce speech function like where is the remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes beep , something to look into , what the cost that something like that would be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it may be something to explore .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll just explain bit of the components .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "first you have the energy source .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the energy source would be battery , simple battery that you can find anywhere .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "figured that would be best , 'cause when the battery stops functioning we could just use you could just go out and buy new one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we didn't and we don't have to do all to be too complicated about that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the energy source is connected to the infrared button , but the infrared button works only via the chip and the subcomponent to the switch there is switch between these .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when the switch is pressed in on this case it switches button , when button is prush pushed in , electric current goes through here , and in immediately , bulb lights up displaying to the user that something has happened .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's so the user won't be thinking , did the button be pressed , what happened .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or press button but nothing's happening on the t_v_ , so is something wrong .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's just to explain the of to make it clearer to the user .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the signal goes via chip that's translated into electric sig electronic signals and then it's processed and then it's sent to the infrared bulb where it will be received on the receiving end .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and those interpreted by the device , this case the television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "my personal preferences here , have to keep it simple .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not too many gadgets and functions , just like you said the most users you have lot of buttons and you use you don't use them , so why should we invent spend more time on those .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should stick by with infrared transmitting and no receiving .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so no input from the television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we shouldn't be spending time on teletext and st things like that , because when you want teletext on infrared you'd have to build in receiver too , and so in order to receive the signals from what's on t_v_ and such .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so figure that would be spending too much money and time and yes , but what should we agree with you , but should we spend money or and time on building receiver into the remote control ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", another problem , current t_v_s can even send infrared .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause that would be extra components , extra designs , larger remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "these all that we have to take in account .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so my personal opinion is no receiver .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "should look into the design and the functionability .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like said , use one button for multiple functions , or just hide the few buttons of switching it open , the usual .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and don't overbuild , we shouldn't make big remote control for simple functions , but we should stick to the basics .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that was my personal opinion .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that was my presentation , but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , go ahead .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the last presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have plenty of time , tim and janus don't talk to ten minutes , so take your time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you take your time too long will eventually warn you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm going to give presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and usability functions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one , so if you going to design remote that looks good , that shouldn't weigh over the if it's possible to make , but also the user friendliness , so tha that's some of the main points .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and another one is the use of many functions will make it more difficult , so use as little functions as possible or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you have fifty functions you don't want fifty buttons to be shown at the same time , 'cause when you visit an internet site you don't want fifty links to see , but use hierarch hierarchy structure .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and one of the ideas was use touch screen , but in how far that is possible , since we are sticking to infrared and the remote cannot receive anything , but we might consider that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "hope this is all clear to you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you can use remote like this with all the functions , many functions , but , your thumb is little bigger than it than this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have to be very careful what you push , and if you're looking for teletext you'll be searching for half an hour from , where is it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "where the hell he here and , when you have to use something else .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so just keep it simple , make clear buttons , easy to use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you want to use play and back and stop , that's very important .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this was because of our last discussion , if multiple machines are used , create easy switch between the machines , but it's no longer applying .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "prefer to use it only for t_v_ and not to give too many options and if possible , the buttons should give dr direct action , not first select , and so that's where the difficulties lie .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you just said you wanted to combine more functions in one , so you want to keep it simple , but that if you want to do that , then you can't escape the fact that there will be buttons which give more options than one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this so that's the thing you have to weigh against each other .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , but you have to keep in mind that several t_v_s don't even have menu structure , or they have very simple menu structure , so you have to keep in mind that not all not our remote won't be able to work on all televisions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do we want to use few options and might not be so or original , or multi-purpose as we thought , or do we want to use many buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so weighing those factors .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's an option if you use an or touch screen , that in the middle are the main keys , like displayed on the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "something like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just in the middle the general functions , like play , channel switching , and then at the top or at the bottom , some menus like settings or that you can drop down .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but when all the questions had do we want to use menu display on the t_v_ ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or does have to everything be in remotes ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause if you use memory display on the t_v_ , you can simply push more menu and then select the options you want to have and press .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's my recommendation , if you use many options in one buttle button , display the menu on the t_v_ and don't use combination of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds , is too complicated for most users .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so too , but and that's partly because lot of t_v_s have different menus , and when you have particular menu at your device , it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that will be problem .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that would be considerable problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if we have to stick with current technologies and , the restrictions of what's is on the market today , you should keep it at this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "use big clear buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not too many .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we'll loose few option options , but this is more important .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "especially the important buttons , if you want to switch channel , change your volume , use teletext , it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it somewhere away on the remote , behind little thing or touch screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not embed , but then with something like touch screen could make more menu up pop up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , if you want to put on stand-by or change the channel , that should always be possible to do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not first change menu options or switch something .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", as you already told , give some feedback .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if the user is pushing button he should the television or at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , my conclusion is less is more , keep it simple .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we should just ease down on the functionality to keep it accessible on because you all know , if there are lot of function on the television , some you you'll never know and never use , and therefore it's important if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions that are not so important you we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the most important functions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the idea about touch screen is very good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because recently saw news item on t_v_ about new telephones for elder people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they have like touch screen with really big pictures on it like call hang-up , and that's big ad advantage , because one the one hand you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by scaling up the pictures .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's very visual intended .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what was to say more ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's an option .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "keep the primary buttons visible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "make remote that fits easily in the hands and for some design issues , put logo on it and use it in some aesthetic form .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the important buttons make them always accessible and pushable and clear and use touch screen , or if that's will become too difficult just like televi some older telephones use it's possible to flip them open and just expand the number of options that are normally visible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if you pick the idea , the left idea then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the extra functions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the extra functions , you just see menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one , and then all the options will become available and you just scroll through them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but like menu functions or .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen , one small touch screen applet and i'll just make let's say fifteen buttons on it , and we have three of those , actually just menus with sub-menus , with or sub-items , sub-functions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then i'd like to make proposal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you make one big touch screen , use the same concept as here , keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", like the ipod idea that we just saw .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you just have few selected buttons and few menus , and with this idea you could actually make several you can also improve later on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that will be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you t's will be better to have kinda total touch screen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wou would actually go for the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "agree , but it's very important that they always make the same buttons accessible , so use just for special options part of the touch screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so an elder designer picks up the of an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions , you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the t_v_ or to switch the channel without using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "had another idea about parental control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like building in some pin code which allows parents to switch to all channels , but children if children don't the pin code , they can't switch to violent channels or there's just ju just simple log-in , something like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "wh is that possible to use or no ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that is possible , that actually depends on the television , but figure that would be , you see the fi thing is when you buy remote , you set the channels , the channels are different on each te television , they aren't set in preset order , so if you lock on remote , let's say channel fifteen , channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television , so that would be that would be actually the main concern .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", does it have to depend on the television ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that he means that by some option make that remote control and the t_v_ match , and then after that you can use some insert some passwords as being apparent that the children cannot use this change the settings of the t_v_ , like colour and then volume and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that , but if you log in first as parent , you address the channels and like , that's channel fifteen , that's vi violent channel , my ki my kids don't want my kids to watch that , then you set the priority to only parents , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "something like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but make it separate option in the menu , so that it's dif dis displayed from displayed here , so parents , you can de display it on the old style .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would , that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , that's just that's an added feature .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but let's not go too wide about the those things , that's that why we're here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "those things are .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's idea , but that's we wel later in the stage .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i've one little question about total touch screen or , partial , because elderly people may be not used to touch screen , so they want the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , to be , kinda traditionals and the other functions , the more difficult functions to be on the touch screen , but to keep this as normal as possible , to keep it accessible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if you display it on screen with really big numbers that's just as easy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do agree , because , it's just not the same when you touch screen or when you touch button , but have to look at what's our target audience .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can display actual buttons on the touch screens .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's true , that's true .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we are aiming for younger people and they chose so that's probably but they all have to be programmed to fit your t_v_ and that is bit of tricky job .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's true , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "age below forty .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", that's good point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and those young people , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you saw it in my marketing report , they like the new fancy , so touch screen , like microsoft al already developed something like that for multi-media applications .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they like the fancy , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can do that too .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as you can see the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are done .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i've added the this four things from the management board just to keep in mind .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "each time had summary on what you told and what you personal think .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that can be read out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "few things noticed were moment .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the main points in this meeting is how it's going to look with we must keep it simple , but have the opportunity to have more options and have them hidden , so they don't you don't have big thing full of buttons or and the point that you wanna use one controller for hypothetically each television , so you must the functions , know , like the menus or the parental control must be all by the done by the remote control and not by the television .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's the point what we discussed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", some of them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the menus are not identical for all t_v_s , so you have to display it on one t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can use when you how do you call it , synchronized , the remote and the t_v_ , then there's always , there are always possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume and we can look out if there's options that the remote in its memory can see what kinda t_v_ it is , from , it's philips , this and that , and then give the options that are capable the capable from the there are universal remotes and they all have functionality for all the t_v_s , so this wouldn't be extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that's not possible .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you have an , but you have an international market range , so you have big range of .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "add that that's an opportunity .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it's not too complex to do it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually use one of those when they are kinda troublesome , but the thing is whe when you start building something like this you have to build receiver into the remotes , because in order for the remote to process something from the t_v_ , like to synchronise and you have to send and receive , and that's .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "mo no , you can just say the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just build it in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "he me he means just one other thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "with the current remote controls , the universal ones , you have to press , you have to press code for t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in codes , you get book with codes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you look up , have philips h_ fifty five and it says press code four five and you press code four five on the in the remote and it displays all your menu options .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", that would be possible , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now we just connect the t_v_ type to set of options , in just in the memory , so that if you , like profile , so that if you touch in like one four one zero t_v_ the memory pops up the options .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "memory in the remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would be possible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't think that's that takes lot of storage space or some just varia variables .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , that wouldn't be , few variables .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you look at the manuals from universal remotes , there are three four hundreds t_v_s at maximum .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you have all of them , all the old and new t_v_s summed up , so it is possible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it is definitely po , firmware upgrade .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , on the other hand on the other hand , if you have remote and buy new t_v_ that isn't incorporated in the remote new remote ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have five minutes to go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then you have to buy new one , it's very good for marketing , or an update , software update .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "firmware upgrade
