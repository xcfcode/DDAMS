"A"}, {"text": "we decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about the use of screen on the remote control because of costs .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we cou wi will be able to clarify this question to today .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so hope that your respective pr presentations will help us .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform who starts ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you are you saved your presentation somewhere ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you're four ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which is trend watch .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "mr marketing experts .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "investigate the preference more investigate deeper the preference of the users .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the current investigation the current trends ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "wha what found can you .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "after they want something new technologic technologically speaking , but the most what they find more interesting , more or more important it's fancy look and feel instead of the current trend which was the functional look and feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so now more aspect , ma more cooler aspect rather than device with many functions and many buttons with instead of ha of device which can do many things , device which is pleasant to watch , to see .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "also in euro in paris and milan the in paris and in paris and milan the current trend of clothes , furniture and all this fashion it's fruit and the theme is fruit and vegetables .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and also in the u_s_a_ the current the mor the most popular feeling it's spongy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "spongy means eponge ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we should in this direction , so fruit vegetables is the new have you seen the last exposition of clothes in milan ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what do you mean by fruit and vegetables and spongy ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what you mean clothe no , missed that one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "spongy means it it's like sp but what's your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "didn't miss an didn't miss and saw that the fruit , there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they're so they're not like dressed as carrot they just have like pictures of fruit on , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , not yet , not yet .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we're not gonna have remote control in the shape of banana , just and so which fruit are you thinking of ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so te textu textures , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "vegetable textures and all this kind .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "drawings of bananas .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is in the next slide certainly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , it's not .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ha haven't thought of any particular fruit , but the general aspect of the remote control may could remind some vegetable , some instead of vegetable , some natur natural object .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it depends on the shape no , not too much focus , not too much focu not too similar to fruit because next year the ten the trend will be different .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you can display banana on the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you want the remote control to be the shape of fruit , or you want just some like fruit logo on the so something that looks half like fruit and half like an elephant .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "means buttons are in the shape of fruits , buttons are in the frape shape of fruits , apple , banana , something like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "apple for channel one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we shouldn't be at re really attached to the trend but , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "african or as an elephant ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that we can discuss afterwards .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , i'm not , i'm not really if that would really appeal to everyone though , just to fashion gurus , like just like little bit little fruit picture somewhere in the corner , but about how ergonomic , an orange is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ma we should further specify what target are we focusing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in my opinion we should focus on young people because they are more open to new devi new devices and also according to the marketing report ninety five percent of young people was able to buy cooler remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but is it is fruit ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is the new trend of the no we should think about shape with it device with shape of some .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", apple has the ipod so , imag 'cause they have an apple on their product , doesn't mean fruit is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it has to be easy to use though and to hold , you don't wanna pear or watermelon .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don don't you think we can find the shape of fruit which is handy to use ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "probably the only thing is banana that think of , cucumber .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , but you also have to you have to also have , fit all the buttons and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's , it the thing is you have normally with buttons , they have to be at some point attached to circuit board so if you're gonna have things like on cylindrical device it may be difficult to build .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't it will be rolling lot .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but li like your idea that we shouldn't have lot of buttons so do you want an with twenty five euros ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and you will not have pla enough lot of place to put on banana also .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you're the marketing expert you should tell us if it is too much or not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "according to the report people are more interested in fa fancy look and feel and in technological inno in innovation , so , will give more importance to the look and feel than rather than the new inputs and also it's i'm not convinced about this because you need internet connection , you need more things , it's not just buying new control re remote , you need buying control remote , buying more things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you suggest to go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you're simply looking to remote control that looks like banana with few buttons with only few buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not so simple .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for given an example .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you can go ahead ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , it's what already said .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll give the floor .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you are user interface guy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you're three ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it's this one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "go for it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so received an email around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit , which is way for you to have conversation with your coffee machine and or remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it's just speaker ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's no , what it is , it's very it has microphone , has speaker , it's got little chip and it allows you , it's sample sensor sample speaker .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's not microphone .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "actually i'm not reading microphone there , so that's why you can all have conversation , it just to speak to you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "sample sensor sample speaker .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it means that it can recognize , it can do like match on certain phrase that you speak and then can play back phrase in response to that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but there's no understanding of the phrase .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , you could build that in , you could link the recognition of certain phrase to some function on the remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the thing is , we have this technology available in-house .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , but the thing is there's still gonna be cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the production of the components , so it but it means we can consider this from theoretical or usability viewpoint without worrying too much about how to develop it because we have this already done .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "whilst , some people might get annoyed if we just dump it , it's it it's no , it's it'll recognize keywords , but keywords in certain order like phrase .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's something that unclear really understanding .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is this technology that recognize keywords speech keywords ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you train it for certain , for certain phrase , you say the example they said that they have up and running with their prototype is they've actually integrated into the coffee machine that we're producing is , you can say good morning to the coffee machine and it can recognize that phrase and it'll playback good morning , how would you like your coffee ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it's just to , it's just to playback something ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so actually that was bad example , 'cause it doesn't actually ask how do you want your coffee because it can't really understand the response , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is not really to do control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "only , like , only in the sense that it can recognize set target word an it's designed as fun thing , but you could use it as way to implement completely pointless .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is just more like poi pois .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it it's it is easy fancy thing that you can bring to we can bring to the remote control that will not have any comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of view .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you can but the can we use it for saying , channel fifty , channel twenty ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "unless , you like having conversation with your remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the thing , if you can but you have to pro though it's fairly simple design so you would have to record into the device every possible combination , you have to tr train it to learn channel fifteen , that whole thing , not just the word channel and the word fifteen , it doesn't have that logic in it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is so this is much more than tak taking this technology , bringing it to the remote control and using it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , that would be some development work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is out of discussion .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if it is something that you can we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control no this is banana-bando , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "banana-man don't t's worth it though , it doesn't really add much to the functional design and it's not mature enough to use as speech recognition engine , so , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then it could be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's go ahead .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if we can just move on to the next slide , i've just done quick mock-up of some of the features of our potential funky-looking remote control , you see , was unaware at this point of the fruit focus , so at the moment it's more of box focus .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it doesn't look like banana .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you can fit you're saying now you can fit it to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "looks like tr look likes tro tropical fruit .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", this is actu this could be genetically engineered fruit that's designed to be square so that it packs tighter in the boxes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , i've just indicated here , we could have actually two scroll wheels , 'cause the scroll wheel is fairly key part of , everyone has that it's that it could be quite useful thing , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "stable thing , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to have , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it's important , to have two scroll wheels because , you want one for the channel , but you also want one for the volume , because it's the volume it's , it's very handy for it to have instant feedback and response , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , i've also included this turbo button because , every design should have turbo button , and so this is , unique problem with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television , the tuner on the t_v_ is not gonna be able to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll , so , the person might want to have might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them , in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then , displays that station .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what's turbo button ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or they might want to scroll and have quick glimpse of it , even if it lags behind what they're doing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it con it controls the speed ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so with this turbo button you can , say , skip over channels if , if i'm going if i'm scrolling past them and , it's , you could have little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel it's really going fast or whatever .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , that's , those are the two important features we need on the remote , but we can discuss about what other buttons we need , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it could be , if we wanna have like very cheap device , we could either consider that we want to sell this as very , if it's gonna be banana , that's pretty gimmicky thing that doesn't have that much functionality , it's just couple of scroll wheels and button it's hard to get so many buttons on banana and it's still very it may even be for most for some people more functional than their current remote , but if they have these scroll wheels , so , what other buttons do we want ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could have , you need an on and off switch , but you could turn it on by taking the top off the banana , it's like spy flick thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so sounds crazy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like crazy ideas .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's why you're marketing guru .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it looks like we're going completely to forget about the thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's the thing , as have we decided that we can only spend , twenty five euro ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that no we can we can't use that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not spend , but , charge twenty five euro .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could use somehow the coffee machine dialogue interface or so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you we can ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can't use that to comman co communicate , it's just thing no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we can say channel twenty five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's one way .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then you have to have template for every channel , for hundred channels , you have to be able to recognize .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's not lot one hundred templates , it's not , it's designed for cof .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's probably more than , than our can handle because it's designed for coffee machine , to say hello in the morning .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it design for coffee machine ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's its current application , would presume that it's , they wouldn't design it to handle hundred things so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you could ask your the you could ask the engineering department if we can .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but just made the point , don't if that speech recognition is , even if we can do it , it's not really appropriate for television environment .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you want to move to your slides ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but did have one thing from previous meeting , you were talking about being able to find the remote control and was talking about extendin being able to extend the remote control by having , base station that can control other things as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it might be useful to have some base station , even if it's just you press on button on it and the remote control starts beeping , this is way of finding the remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in that case the speech recognition the speech thing could be useful just to say i'm here but it's probably bit of overkill if you could just have beeping it's speech synthesis and it's speech , not really speech recognition , but pattern matching , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's speech synthesis thing , something has been stored and it's just spoken out .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let's move on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you're two ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is going to be about the component design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so first thing is we need power source for the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so was of the idea that we can have two power supplies , one is the usual batteries which are there , they could be chargeable batteries if there's basis station thing and on top of that we can have solar cells , when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty innovative kind .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces , there should be some flexibility in .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that fits in with the spongy design philosophy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so there should we should think of something like that and then it should be double curve .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then controls for the traditionals traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they don't feel that it's an alien thing for them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , just one second , when you say double curve , what do you actually mean ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you reckon you could like draw us thing on the , on the whiteboard 'cause i'm not , but like , convex or concave ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "double curve is , you have curves on both the sides if i'm .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's symmetrical thing , whatever it is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , it could be curve , so it could be convex , conve concave , depending on what we want .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so there are flats , there are single curve and there are double curves .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "these are the three things , and there are different materials , with plastic you can have double curve but with certain other materials we cannot have double curve .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so there was there were many other materials like wood , titanium and all those things , but plastic is the most appropriate one , it'll bring the cost down and anyway it's wooden cases .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "although , wood could be quite stylish option , if you take like , quality wood that's got grain and you put some , some varnish on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but there is no elasticity which could be but the components inside .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "depends , you have the outs the wood itself is not gonna break so you don't have to worry too much about the case being broken , it's the inside .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but inside you could have you can still have some cushioning that's not visible to the user .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "very too expensive to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you could also , you can have just very thin veneer of wood as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and also but it's more easier to do banana in plastic than in wood .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's true , but are we set on the banana idea ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "actually was thinking that the shape of banana is not it's not really handy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "look like it looks like you are all targeting that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes it is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the name in english this it's not fruit it's vegetable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is it an apple which has banana is more handier as compared to this , and to capsicum .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's like pumpkin or green .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what does it taste like ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you put in the salad .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "oui c'est ca pepper .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is it what's it in french ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", so capsicum or pepper .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but they do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it's al it also suits with the double curve for easy of no , in i'm it's fun .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it seems little bit bulky to me , like with banana you can have but like banana you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel on top and just roll it back and forth like that , but with how you would hold capsicum and so is that , when you say speaker support , you mean it just has some output pinned which , but the speaker is actually attached to the chip in some way , or is just the signal ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's not re it you t's really fancy and fun ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you think that young people that are .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "more than banana ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but banana is not so handy , that's handier .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's kind it's more it's really ergonomic , it's fit in the hand and you've lot of surface to put the controls .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's move on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so time is running , let's move on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated , just and scroll button with push technology for channel selection , volume control and teletext browsing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "these are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company and we can go ahead with that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can go to the next slide .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then there are different chips , one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we can have regular chip for control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "pricing is factor for us , that's why we'll go for the regular chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and regular chip supports speaker support , so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it could be beep thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , it's onto the chip , most probably , not hundred per cent about that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so are there any issues where we place this chip to make you can actually hear the speaker from the outside of the banana ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that will be the volume control which user shou it should be already pre-defined .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it should be whatever will be the case , the chip is always going to be sitting inside .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the speaker , if the speaker is actually on the chip , then if it's too far away from the casing , or if the casing is too thick , then you may not hear the speaker .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as or as hearing is concerned , we can have some gap at some place , so that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the speaker close enough to the outside .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so these were the component selection and these things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can go to the next slide .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and these were the findings which saw with the web , that user wants to have control more than one device wants to control more than one device from the same remote control , so our t_v_ remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like v_c_r_ d_v_d_ players which are usually attached with the t_v_ , because users are like this and they don't want to have one remote control for everything , so with this additional little , we might be having slightly better market for us .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "although , if it depends , if we like , if we are concentrating on like fruit design , then we wanna sell collection of fruit , like different fruit for each device .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that , that sometimes people like to collect things that of similar type .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "remotes objects , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that would be funny at the beginning but after one month you will be tired of be surrounded of fruits .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you're the one who wanted to do fruit in the first place .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no but just one fruit to control everything .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like power fruit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "power fr power mando , supermando fruit .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and as could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really hot thing and we should have it on the remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "actually didn't understand very this trace speaker lost control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's pretty handy feature .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you're having basis station .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "your usually your remote sits on that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you and it's that's why it can have chargeable batteries .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now let's say basis station is with the thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you have to buy two things , the banana and the basis station .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's like telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so now what user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries , they're rechargeable batteries , so over the period of cor time he'll recover the cost .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you're having the basis station and there is button , if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so where the remote is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's people would find that worth it even if it wasn't recharging station , even if they didn't have to buy extra batteries , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but i'm bit worried about the budget .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so although you do need to include r_f_ circuitry in the remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is basis station is nothing more , just it's wire which is coming from the main cable and you're having one socket on which the thing sits .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but all these things are usually in-house so we don't have much problems .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so component cost is going to be the least .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "anyway , we are not using really advanced technology , has already been ruled out , a_s_r_ has been ruled out .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's the basic thing but very trendy and very user-friendly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm just wondering actually , 'cause , this whole fruit thing with the banana , it's it seemed like it first seems bit niche , like only few people would really want banana , but what if it was stylised banana ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "rather than having it yellow and really looking exactly like banana , you could make it silver .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , to give you the idea of banana but without it looking completely kitsch .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for better want of better word ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you think that yellow it's kitsch .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", don how many peop they , like this colour , like still in the shape of banana .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you make something that looks like banana it should have the colour of banana .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , li like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "otherwise it'll be mis means you don't get any feeling then .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's neither banana nor and going to the last slide .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , exactly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , just not exactly the same texture as banana and just , because the thing is it's gonna be little bit difficult to make to give like the texture of banana anyway and to have the exact shape .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you're gonna not be able to do it properly you may as do it in stylised way that just looks bit more , twenty first century rather than sixties or seventies .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let's move on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "before st before ending the meeting i'd like to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "go for it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , not you , you can finish your slides before .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "anyway , users'll be so the findings is users'll be very interested in our locator device to find their misplaced remotes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that was very it's very good suggestion by everybody .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so done for the presentations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we need to take some de decisions about what we're going to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so propose that you go to the whiteboard and we're going to report all the ideas we had during this these presentations just to draw some sketch about what will be the prod final product and where superman go banana and extra func functionalities such as wheels , the speaker unit not in order not to lost the device , do don't remember you call it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the basis station .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "basis station , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're going for stylish banana shape .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , you wanna hold like the way the end of the banana you wanna hold as ma you wanna kinda hold like gun rather than 'cause you don't want it to point towards the floor .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , so if you have like , so we need , something that can fit banana shaped object .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what about this shape ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "more or less .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we if it has really the model shape of bana you could the starting is good but it could it should have more the shape of banana if you want to point really at the thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's less space on this to put with the buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but how many buttons do we need ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you don't want to do that movement which is difficult if you don't have to do it , it's better .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what about the base station .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so ti time is running , we have to we have to we have to move forward .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so let's skip to this idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we have this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have basis , how do you call it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll have base station extra on the side .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have r_f_ for beeping .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", we need that , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we need r_f_ to beep .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we that means we need button on the basis .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "basis station , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright , so we need .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can you go quickly ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we are going to add also you as you suggested the whee some wheels to control the volumes and channels and your tur turbo button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which it's probably best actually on the underneath of the device , so you have yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "on the , here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the wheel at the level of the thumb .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you have the thumb here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you have two wheels .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , you need one here and one on the other side , so you got volume an and channel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we need power on off switch as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for the remote ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just the switch , no not for the t_v_ for the t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "remotes don't have power on off switch .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you on the side .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , that'll be controlled by the those buttons'll be there already , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what about four millions ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "means on the remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because remote is going to have both the interfaces , scroll as buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they are not going to cost you much , everything is in-house and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if the traditional user is gonna buy banana remote in the first place , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's another issue which didn't think of .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you need to keep it , how many of these did we wanna sell ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but our targets are very high , means fifty million euros is the profit which we want make .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'t remember , what was , but how many units did we need to sell ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "twelve point five is the profit on one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "point four million ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "four point four million .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "point four million .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's lot of fruit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in the market .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what about adding the this word spotting , keyword spotting recognition saying volume up volume down ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "time is running , we have to close the meeting in few minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , the next step , you can come back to your seat .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the next step is to go for to is to go to building prototype , based on this , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so next meeting you have to prepare the followi things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have to work on the look and feel design and you have to work on the user interface , you two you have to work together to model the first prototype .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "marketing expert have to go to product evaluation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's too difficult .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's too difficult but people like innovation and that's really innovative and if it would cost lot , just few five words .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's not possi it will not be possible to implement it for the next prototype , so it's in the next prototype so let's skip it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for the future prototypes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", for the if it works , we'll go for an orange one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that can be the that can be like the turbo banana plus commando .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "honour the fruit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll see next meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so meeting's over ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have to go design the prototype .", "speaker": "B"}], "id": "xxxxx", "relations": [{"y": 1, "x": 0, "type": "Explanation"}]}]
