.", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you have thit that was .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's about it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the important findings are innovation is more important than ease of use for the our target group .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and colouring is important and soft materials .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so ease of use is important , but technology is twice as important .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and what was even more important ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the fancy look and feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's the most important thing for our customers .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "roo , could you do your presentation ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't ha really have much to add , because most of things we already said in the previous discussion .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the previous ideas were voice recognition and the round button for the channel programming and volume .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "t's good to sum up the things we already thought about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "few interface found on the internet are these .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "these are both with voice recognition , but they're very advanced and very high-tech and just , weird shape .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so suggest couldn't had small mock-up sign on the on paper .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it didn't work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my pen didn't load the information .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so made really simple shape on in powerpoint .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we could make round an oval remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it's organic , so that's very good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and what i'm thinking about , we should make very light but grip this is how you hold remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it shouldn't be too glatt , too slippery , because .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if you have something like the siemens phone , it's rubber .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have to grab it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's easy in your hand .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there are also remote controls who have little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in , so you can get really good grip on it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ex for your fingers , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you don't have to attain much pressure to it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's lot easier .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it grips automatically .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but i'll go into that deeper in my presentation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and to add on ruud's information , in this interface we can have high-tech with the voice recognition and , the fancy colours and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and so on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "way too much for our goal , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if you have the voice recognition , you can programme like thirty controls on it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but i'll go into that , because there are some possibilities and some impossibilities .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "had talk with our manufacturing division , and we had talk about all the different components who are in this design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "these are the things we've looked at .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and used the web to find my information .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "about the casing , we have three different casing possibilities .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have the uncurved or flat case .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the most common remote con control form we're used to is just it ju it's just box .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm don't have any pictures of this thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have curved one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's curved in two dimensions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have to imagine it's bit like wave form .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's little more advanced in its shape .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we have an even more advanced shape , which is curved in three dimension .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can compare it little bit with the big grey image you had in your presentation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the big remote control , something like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it's quite advanced and it's quite daring to use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for these casings we have different types of finishing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can use plastic , which is very slippery and not so , but you can give it any colour , which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can use wood and titanium .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and these latex cases , there's just the plastic ones won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which brings me to the different energy sources .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we even seem to have hand dyn dynamos for powering our remote controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you really have to imagine like winding up your it would be very new , but it's retro style , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it would be very new to the market , but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is quite interesting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's also kinetic energy supply .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so when you're watching t_v_ or when you're you have to make some energy kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall , whatever you wish .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like the watch .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it have it has to move , that's the sense of it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you can store the energy in the thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if hook on to that , the kinetic thing is very funny .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's very funny .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "solar is it's , but it's , your calculator has solar panel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "hand dynamo , know .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if you're watching movie , how many times you take the remote control and if you have watch , you have the kinetic idea in watch also .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you walk and but you you're sitting on couch .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but from your own watch your watch uses minimal con it consumes minimal amount of energy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the shaking of your body , which is almost every activity makes your body shake , it charges it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the problem here is that it supplies very little amount of kinetic energy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you have problem when you're watching movie and you haven't moved the remote control in an amount of time , and you want to switch the channel , it might not work .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's something you have to keep in mind .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , but there's possibility com to combine it with traditional batteries , so we can save on the batteries and when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because the voice recognition feature consumes quite lot of power .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , it does .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll come to that later .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we have the traditional solar power , which is just piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the user interface controls , we have the push-buttons and we also have scroll-wheels .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's just like mouse .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can scroll , you can also push it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in the indicators we have the displays , which means you can watch in display which channel you have chosen like that of the li amount of volume which is currently and we also have double scroll-buttons , which are just two of these things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we don't really have the button we had in mind in our last meeting , the thing with the round with the four yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can just make four push-buttons in form of round .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that is possible too .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but don't think the scroll-wheels had some information about it too .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't think there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this will be the remote , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'t see any scenario where you would use scroll-wheel with button on it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "mayb , me neither .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when you integrate some functions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "with channel selector .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what about integrating scroll-bar on this side ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's possibility , but flores , think about scenario where you would use the scroll-button for volume , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's do it's done before .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because this is how you keep it volume ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's quite good , yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's it , what he means is there's an button integrated in the scroll-wheel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's no scenario where you use the button in the scroll-wheel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you just use the wheel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what about mute ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "thi this is my volume button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and either on this side or this side and click it to muten the device .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that that's one possibility , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it makes it different from the traditional devices on this market .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's quite goods .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i'm looking for way to make it little different than the traditional ones .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that that's something you two need to think about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ruud , wha what do you thing about scroll-bar ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's obvious new .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it might attract the young customers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's done before , there are many other devices like telephones and our radio , pocket radios .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we use this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , it's been done years ago and don't see it anywhere now .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's not no .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "all the sony telephones use it , for volume .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "nokia has , it's not really scroll-wheel , but on their side the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , but it uses two separate buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "know , it's not really scroll-wheel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it doesn't use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "something for roo here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for you too , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "believe if you have what we've earlier said , the grip places in the remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in range of your thumb .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wi within reach .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , you have to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so in that case the volume button on the side of the remote control would be perfect .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have to know , if you want to use these rubber double-curved case , you must use these push push-buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's no way you can integrate displays .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it's all curved .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's there are no flat areas where you can incorporate these things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's limitation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "about the components , just the hardware .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have three types of chips we can use and these chips incorporate all the logica and hardware that is needed to send signal .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have simple , regular and advanced chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and there is something like sample sensor and sample speaker , which is little cryptic to me .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that's the voice recognition thing that we are thinking about .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can have some information about it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in the voice recognition you say word you can programme words like volume up .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "of mute , let's say mute .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you programme it , you mute and you give an action to it that that's really the mute function and when you speak in the remote control , it repeats your saying .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's the sample sensor .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if you say mute , it says mute again , and then it's , believe it's , and then he repeats its action what which he believes it is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it performs the action .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you say mute , he repeats mute and you makes computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's the voice recognition item we were searching for .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this sample sensor requires an regular chip , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no op i'm not very .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , it's not in here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we want to use the display , we really need the advanced version , which is bit little bit more costly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if we don't want to use any of these more advanced functions we can keep with the simple chip , which is bit cheaper .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "did we already decide on the display ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , but that's something for roo here to think about .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't have haven't looked for information about it , but don't nformation don't think you need it on display .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "especially when we have to look at cost , don't think 'cause all any t_v_ can view digit on screen , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't think either .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't think you need it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on screen display .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my conclusion , unfortunately the market has decided the little other than .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the market would like sort titanium casing , but they seem to like natural .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we should think about wood finish .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've chosen the more battery with solar cell solution for the energy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's more reliable , it's cheaper .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so don't think we should use the dynamo thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the kinetic thing it it's possibility .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's more advanced , but i'm you should combine it with batteries .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's bit too flashy , too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "otherwise it will not too advanced , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's in some way it can give us an advance , because you will save on your batteries .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that that's the same with the solar cell .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's no different .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it's more robust .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's more functional .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but what about the markets wants colourfuls designs ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if you use titanium .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , but the that's what sebastian said .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the titanium thing we have to skip it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "he said this is what this is my personal preference .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but yet , understood that the market is different .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so no , rubber with colours .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we should skip the titanium , and we should use wood like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , the older people liked wood .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and would think and they can be implemented with regular chip ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it needs to be rubber .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no the , the younger people liked soft material .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these scroll-wheels , they can be they can be handy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so yes , they can .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but they really need the regular chip , you cannot use the sa simple , i'm not very .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we also we already need the regular chip for the sample sensor speaker , evalu but most infrared remote controls don't have to be pointed .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's an different so , if you stick with the simple straight-forward not curve design , it's too dull .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but do we want the curved design , or it's too dull .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't think our customers will like it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if you take the double-curved , then you cannot you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is the best of two worlds .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what about the issue addressed at the beginning of the meeting ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the voice function with the infrared issue .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because it it's of cour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's imagine it's very dull to talk to device if you have to point to another device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's very unlogical .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the there has to be some pointing at .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "depends also on your , it depends on your walls actually .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but all lights get absorbed , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you take your hand before it , it won't work , but you can point it just to the other wall .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you have smooth walls , it probably you're probably .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then , it might be bit more of issue .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , because the walls they reflect the infrared light .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it has an it's easier .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "suggest we use the sensor sample .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the sample sensor and sample speaker .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "with regular chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the regular chip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it gives us the advantage of yes , yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the scroll scroll-wheels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like the scroll wheels idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and skip the part .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't it's any value added thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it looks , according to ruud , the market likes new flashy technology , and is , know , but it's less standard than , we are not very we do not know much about the financial part .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not very flashy and new .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because if we do have enough space in our finance , would say do integrate it , because it adds little ext extra high-tech feeling to it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we already have the scroll-wheels , the sp the speaker the speak recognition , the rubber , the fancy colours .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "our customers will go insane

"don't you think ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was more thinking about the fruit colours that the ruud showed us before .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "believe the but you have already you must have

week ago , keyboard manufacturer would print , with and no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its techniques .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text":

that up to you two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what did you say ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can use , when you use the buttons , they'll be made of rubber too .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it has the spongy feel also .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or you could use plastic buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in the rubber .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because it what do you touch

the case .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so still then , if you feel li if you feel your remote control , you just rub on the cover , so you rub on the painting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the plus or the minus .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , the signs .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have to draw the , it's on the cover .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but this is on the pla , know .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "know which you understand af you mean .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if you just move the problem .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what about making this rubber and making this plastic ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see what you mean .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's possible , because our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing .", "speaker":

you separate these do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if you want the spongy feel , you need to make these buttons all of rubber .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "never touch between the buttons .",
