also have to stand out , 'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we have to make that we're better usability , and stand out by just looks of it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so make it just different colour or different shape , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this was my presentation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text":

"speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we have elderly people , so we need to keep it simple .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the way want to keep it simple is to use the sen standard .", "speaker": "B"},

one two three etcetera .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "text service options .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and found an could of favourites ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "always look up the same pages on text and always have to click the number .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if you could make new option , that you just have to press one button and you get on your no t's it was just thought .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you might as remember the number .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's too complicated , but not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's good idea , but mayb for me it's if use my telephone , never use those buttons to call sh never .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'm , would find it handy , when you just press one button and you get on six .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but how can you remember what channel connects to what favourite button ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what was reading on the page .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "remote control just sends commands , basics commands to the television .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so switch to channel six .",

never ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but for user to remember , if press that button it goes to that channel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but isn't it hard to remember ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like favourite one and as hard as no , neither do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so and if don't do it , old people it's not , it's still not it's not anymore just on the front as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now , not .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , elderly people .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they don't like new features .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "play , pause .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if that's usable when not anymore for t_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "miss did miss any other buttons , basic buttons ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "couldn't think of any other ,

{"text": "the next and previous .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "previous know , but next channel ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't thi li like web browser , so , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just very simple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but there's also button to go to the channel you've been before .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like web browser back button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it is , but it's all too difficult for old people .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't have did , don't think you use that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it gets some seconds .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "only when you want to go to , just use when you wanna switch between channels all the time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and how do you want to do it , like if you have channel above ten ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "normally you can press one , zero or ten plus or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you have that , the ten plus button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just one pressing , or quickly after each other .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to just keep it simple and standard features .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wouldn't it be problem to because you have to be fast enough .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the elderly people .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "mayb but that's in the t_v_ as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's how the t_v_ handles it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you can have button that says two st two stripes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's no it's not it's what paul says .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you have like five seconds period to press those two buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's not remote control that makes the t_v_ do one two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's the t_v_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must type one or two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if you have universal t_v_ controller , you needed one button that has two stripes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we have period of , five seconds to press those buttons , and that and not for elderly people to look , one two press and aim and so don't .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but do we still need two level remote control ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because if we only have that only no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's only for television now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "thought of another one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "most things in modern t_v_s are also on the menu .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you also need menu button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then navigation but we can integrate that with volume and previous and next , so you have four arrows .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you ha really have to divide between functions you often use , like switch channels and volume and that things , and the menu button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because you almost never use menu button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", but , mute button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's still good idea , i'm not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you'll also have to use mute button to , not where you have to put it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's the layers that produce .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now have to figure out what's what to put on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what we're gonna use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and later we can do the design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now my personal preferences .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "using the standards , basic that we should stand out unique , being unique with the design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we have to , make different shape than usual .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so when you are in the shop and you see our t_v_ controller hanging , that it stands out .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not just in the row when you see all the same remote controls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "does it have to be it has to be with different colours or it's like imac .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can give it out in different colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can choose blue or yellow or that's fa that's fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just to make it but it looks cheap as , because it's small thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's only twenty five euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it looks very cheap if you make it , you just what happened .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can look at mobile phones .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have to look at mobile phones , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they they're designed very .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and are the same , just bit smaller .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you think you can't make t_v_ controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , that's good example .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we hurry up bit , because otherwise we won't make it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it fin are you finished ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we discussed everything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the working design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the method used is search the web .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just the web page provided .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm not very technical educated , but could figure it out .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what happens is you press button , then circuit gets closed by pressing the button , like switch .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows what bu button is pressed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so like you press one , that circuit is closed and then the chip produces pattern .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like morse code to and sends that to the l_e_d_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the light emitting diode , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the light emitting diode is producing infrared light .", "speaker":

two different things but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we also have to have led li led light on it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is ain't it just to indicate that it's transmitting ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm not if it's the same thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or just green one , because it's if you use it , it's green or the red , it's green .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "depends on yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's in the case that it's active .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's not it's just the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "when you press it .", "speaker": "C"},

"no , we have recharger in it , so if we can still make that then but it's if it was green .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it doesn't have to be red .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's just to indicate something's on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that it's working .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that it's not the batteries are low .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's not very important , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "green or red or whatever , it is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just to indicate it's working .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we have to make buttons for that as , to make it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the receptor in the t_v_ senses the pattern .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we have to understand what patterns are used to , to make it universal .",

time the television turns off .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then , it it's the one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and you can stop it , and then it's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you don't have to search for your television or your code .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it search the pattern for itself .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we use that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it we have to make bit more intelligent chip than the standard one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because you have to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "say can you just say it again , because was just looking there's just short .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have this chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but ma for brands of t_v_ these patterns are different .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so like when you press one on one t_v_ it go to one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and on the other t_v_ it won't work , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what you have to do is get these patterns .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and by that can be done by just cha , changing this pattern all the time .", "speaker": "C"},

.", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we just keep it one level then ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , 'cause we don't have that many buttons , the design is most important .", "speaker": "B"},
