goal here , it has to operate t_v_ , blah .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we're going to do individual work on that and then meet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "same thing with conceptual design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work , meet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's the whole process for today .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then the detailed design , just more in-depth , get the actual schematics of the remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first we're gonna start off by using our tools .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the whiteboard thing , do you wanna give that try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we should forgo the whiteboard

twenty-five euro , and our profit aim is fifty million euro .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're going to make this an international product marketed in the states , in europe , in asia .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and our production cost to make that profit is gonna be max of twelve fifty euro per remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're gonna talk for little while .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here are some topics that we might be able to discuss .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "expe our experiences with remote controls , our first ideas about this new remote , anything that you can

multifunctional remote , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one remote for everything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and everything being , we have what , sound system , t_v_ , d_v_d_ , v_h_s_ , tivo ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they'll be phasing v_h_s_ out shortly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it's still there , so if po if we're gonna do it or if it's not like sony , if it's like .",

we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and what we need an insanely good instruction booklet , because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and another thing that is important is the design of the product , how it feels in your hand .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if it's just flat and boring those don't nobody wants to buy those any more .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they want the ergonomic ones .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they want like the flashy lights .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like this came from las vegas .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ones that look high-tech , too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but at the same

use triple a_s .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "some but , then it's if we need to do triple we can , but most people usually have double a_s around .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so double or triple ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that has to do with the size of it too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as long as we know that issue is here we can triple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we want it to be more thin , then we'd probably wanna go with triple .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can you with small lithium battery ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it's , we don't have to decide about it now , just as long as we remember battery type and size is important .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're closing the meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here's what we're going to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the i_d_ , which is who ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you're going to think about the working design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what do you think that means ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and u_i_d_ , the technical fun functions design , making it does everything that we need the remote to do , the functionality of it , operating all those different things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the marketing person , that's courtney , is going to do the user requirements specification .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that means specifying what exactly the user is going to be looking for .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you're gonna get more specific instructions emailed to you in just little while .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so does anybody have anything they wanna say before we close the meeting ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this meeting is officially over .", "speaker":
