[{"edus": [{"text": "this is our third meeting already .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "hope you enjoyed your lunch .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is the second phase we're going to discuss today .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's the conceptual design meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specification of components .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "conceptual specification of design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and also trend-watching .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "these are hopefully the points you addressed in your pre presentations you're going to show me in few minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but first i'll show you the agenda .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first the opening .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we have three presentations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "after that we have to come to decision on remote control concepts .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how we're going to make it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we're closing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have about forty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so suggest let's get started .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then little thing about the last meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "these are the points we on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the requirements and the target market .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "requirements are teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that button information .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we are going to use default materials .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does somebody have any comments on these requirements ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "these are just the things we thought of , so if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we can work it out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we're going to target sixty to eighty year old customers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so now everybody knows what we're do we're doing , suggest let's get started with the presentations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so shall we keep the same line-up as last time ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll start off then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm gonna inform you about the trend-watching i've done over the past few days .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we've done some market research .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and besides that deployed some trend-watchers to milan and paris to get all of the newest trends .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and i've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the best design would be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these are some overall findings .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "most important thing is the fancy design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the research indicated that was by far the most important factor .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "by innovativeness this means functions which are not featured in other remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for our group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty years old , this is , these factors are slightly more equal .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these are some more group specific findings .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the older people prefer dark colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and our surveys have indicated that especially wood is the material for older people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is , this image will give you little bit of an impression about the look-and-feel that the remote should have .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this leads us to some personal preferences .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the remote control and the docking station should blend in the room .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this would mean no eye-catching designs .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just keep it simple and the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the these would be the innovativeness in the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this would be very important that we at least include these features .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the trend-watchers consulted advised that it should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you could imagine that the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is not really this is new shape to older people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so they would prefer design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it would be kinda more telephone-shaped .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "besides that we would advise to bring two editions , one with wood-like colour and feel , and one with grey-black colour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the wood-like for the more exclusive people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "people with more money .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the grey-black colour for people with less means .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that would be all .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "any questions about the trends ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we go on to the next one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "some research about designing of an interface .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the last meeting we had about using few buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's what want to do in our design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so finding an attractive way to control the remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the found some something about speech recognition .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we can use that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and using little display .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just we have just to focus on the primary functions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so only buttons for sound , for on-off , shifting up sa ca channel or down shifting down .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we need some new attractive functions which attract people for using it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's like speak speech recognition and special button for selecting subtitles .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just what we mentioned last meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and overall user-friendly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so using large buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's possible to make quite cheap system for speech recognition .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can think about when you lost your remote control , you can call it and it gives an sig signal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and for shifting up sen ch channel or for putting out sound , you can just give sign say sound off or and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "television put the sound off put the sound off .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was thinking about the special button for subtitles , just one button to keep it simple .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one push on the button you get small subtitles .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "double push , if double click , so you get big subtitles , for people which who can't read small subtitles .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so and we have to keep in general buttons so we've got the buttons we have to use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , the numbers , zero to nine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the general buttons more general one button for shifting up and shifting down channel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "also we want to use little display for displaying the functions of the buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we can build in function which shows the channel or some which the television is on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so made little picture of it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just we can put the on-off button over in this corner , almost all remote controls are using on-off button on that place .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so people will recognise the button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so display of it , it's just small display .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can put it on top .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's most place where people , most of looks at .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so and special button for shifting up and shifting down channel , it's on place where the thumb of the so you can easily shift up or shift down .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's quite handy place .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so and all the functions for subtitle one button , for sound and for our design , we have to discuss about it so the form of it so and that's it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "about the components design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for the energy source we can use basic battery or , as an optional thing , kinetic energy , like in watch , which you just shake and it produces energy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if we choose for that option , the docking station would become obsolete .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so don't t's really an option .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for the casing , the manufacturing department can deliver flat casing , single or double curved casing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's really up the design that we're gonna use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's doesn't imply any technical restrictions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as case supplement , we could , of that later , rubber belt , like anti-slip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for the buttons , we can use plastic or rubber .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the chip-set , it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we're using an screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and as the trend-watcher presentation showed , people like wood , but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "form should follow function overall .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the kinetic energy source is rather fancy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but depends on what we want .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should disc discuss that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for the case , the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the chip-set really should be advanced because otherwise it would really be simple remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that's it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that brings us to the discussion about our concepts .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so these are the points we have to discuss .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first we can talk about the energy source , since that's has pretty big influence on production price , and image .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so first of all we have to see it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes there are four options .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we could use the basic normal battery .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but don't think that's really an option .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you don't wanna swing before you can watch television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but not every room is very light so it's not very good option .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or the kinetic energy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and how exactly does the kinetic energy work ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you shake your remote , and then it powers up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you just you use it and it works .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "personally don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can get popularity for our product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but what's the function ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wel you could load up the batteries , you could insert the find the lost remote control function in there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for loading up the batteries .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it won't use much energy believe .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's just small display so believe it will run on one battery for six months or more .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so believe one battery is just enough .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "elderly people just like to have everything in place .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and don't think they like remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so docking station will help them give the remote place .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and also what you said .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can introduce voice recognition by finding back your remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it's more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you have but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we can still use the voice recognition , but then for only the channels .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm wondering what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's good point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't have any information on pricing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i'll have to ask the manufacturing department .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause in our earlier market research , if you'd allow me to go to the flat board , smartboard .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it was open here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we also asked if they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can see here , our target group would not do that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control would greatly advise not to do it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that would be better to insert in our other product , that is meant for the younger people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that would also go for the screen then .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's bit higher percentage , but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is but this is here the question was , would you prefer it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and on top of that the screen would help in making the remote control easier to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "easier to use ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , that's good point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but is our research about bi large sh display , or just small one we want to use ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this was for like an screen like you would have on the most advanced mobile phones .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so pretty large .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "personally think the screen we wanna use , with the extra information , nobody has anything against it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because it's just some extra information , and it's easy to ignore as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the we have to discard the voice recognition .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because it will increase cost signifi significantly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and don't think the don't will be lot easier to use , as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that brings us back to the energy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we don't have the voice recognition , it will it won't use lot of energy to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so in that case we could use kinetic energy , but just simple battery which you can reload on docking station is just as good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and much cheaper as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so let me just choose for the battery .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's the best choice .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that brings us to the chip .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there isn't any choice there because we're using the display .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just the advanced .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's gotta be advanced .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then we get to the point of the case .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which brings us little bit back to marketing as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as we saw there is not wood is lot more expensive to produce .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , which they can show off to their grandkids .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "look i've got new remote control , and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and most important factor there is the wooden colour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it wouldn't actually have to be wood , if it's just wood-coloured .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but with colour was lot more expensive ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll have to research .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's lot more difficult to handle and to get in the shape .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it possible to make changeable case .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you 'cause with mobile phones so like the nokia mobile phones , when you can change the case of it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "change the cases .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's possible possibility .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you have just to make one standard remote control , and you can sell few .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can sell the cases .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's very good option .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because then you can advertise as with the give your grandfather new case for his remote control , or whatever .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because that's it's something extra , it's something other remotes don't have , which we can get advantage point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that is true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so and then you can make them with colour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "black and grey , other colours as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we would have to look carefully into the design though .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause we would have to make one control which would fit in with wooden cover and plastic cover .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the more original one , or the more standard one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that would wouldn't design telephone but no we should just , we should then just design one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you suggest we should design two different telephones on which you can apply , remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , but that shouldn't be too much of problem .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so everybody's with the changing covers ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's good option .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "changing case covers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "heard our industrial designer talk about flat , single and double curved .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "could you explain that little more ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and our manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and what would single curved and double curved mean ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it would just only affect the form , for as far as know .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's really just up to the design department what we're gonna use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we can just do whatever we want .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "pick one you like , yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the form has to be it has to it's has to be possible to stand up ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or just only to lie down ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no just to lie down .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the cover of the docking station is also on top of the television then ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll go for that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or besides it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and you can just then click it in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the interface .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what type of interface do we want to use ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can make little drawing of it on the board .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does somebody have ideas for form or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can just use the regular form of it , but it's not quite fancy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you said you wanted to put the changing channels button on the side , so you could , so your thumb would be easily that was very good point 'cause pointed out earlier that lot of remotes r_s_i_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that would be for that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the side .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for left-handed users also .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we is it possible to program it so you got on the left side or on the side buttons for shifting up and shifting up ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and on the other side buttons for shifting , for the sound ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for the volume .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or isn't it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that could we could do that but i'm not if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "usabili ease of use will be lot more difficult , and then it's but you have extra buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if we would make changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield options for the design of the remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause it could be made all symmetrical and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so people can get confused .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that is true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "especially if they have the same writings on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or we have to make left for lefties and you mean if no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can't we make can't we make remote which you can flip over and use on the same functions as the normal one ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then you have to let's see if ca blank one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then you get here's little screen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now have to think .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's plus and min .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no it's not very handy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because the plus and the min will be opposite and all kinds of no that's not gonna work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but is it problem that left-handed persons use different hand ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the functions are that basic that nobody should have any problems with choosing channel or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that is true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's just using your thumb .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could just leave it normal shape .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we have to make it bit more fancy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in one or ano another way .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we should start by choosing case .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because that's the basis you're building on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so could draw them out .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let's look at the flat case .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's from the side so it's rather normal .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the single curved so i'm not really what they're gonna look like , but it's something like this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this type should be better for you or better should prevent repetitive strain injury bit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the double curved looks something like this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so those are the three options we have .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "suggest the single curved , because the curve is pretty good to put the screen in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that elderly people can use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen , because it's bit , it has bit of angle .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so do you say this you got like believe there ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you want to put display over here ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but now it's do you have it upside down or do you have it this that's top ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can make it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the top .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this top .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's possible to make this side like let's see .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to make this side like the colour .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "bit like so in the form of your hand .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's an so the remote control have to lay in your hand .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's possib for so and to put the buttons for changing the channel over here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so get your mouse .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's good one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it's better to put the screen on top .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "rem but this place it's .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so just flip it hundred and eighty degrees around then you get here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you can have this one , you turn it like this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then flip it upside down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because your hand is in the way , if you have the display here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's more logical to have it on top as because , like on your mobile phone , it's always above .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so five minutes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you should just start on blank page .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so then we get here's that's the curve .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here the display , and then buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we can have little bit off here and here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just that's for left hand and hand users .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then the rest of the buttons over here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the on-off button , still on the top .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "still here jus that's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and i'd prefer the corners to be round .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "think that would be better .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "should be more bit more friendly , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "friendly on the eye .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "where's my mouse ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we've got general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so now for the next meeting we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's important that the corporate design image is going to be in the remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so check out the corporate website .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the user interface design , it's the same story .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and product evaluation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the industrial designer and user interface designer are going to work together on this one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you're going to get your instructions sended by the coach .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so just will put these minutes on the in the folder .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we're going to try to finish our project , and make good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which are let's see .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm not if you're going to start away to work together or you're going to fill in the questionnaires first .", "speaker": "A"},
