{"text": "from meeting three , is it alright with you if don't switch it to show , just use it as is ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause this way more easily flip it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "all of us were here for the last meeting , we reviewed the previous minutes before that , each of you made your presentations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the market trend of fruit and veg , spongy , fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we decided chip on print would be used .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we would use plastic with rubber casing , was the consensus , powered by kinetic energy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "looking like scroll , but it's really push button technology , excuse my spelling that was actually in use , that is behind the scenes is push button which we according to kate have very good grasp on doing that in production .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be separate product that could be suggested to management .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and as suggested yellow with black buttons with the company logo , slogan and image might be good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we did have few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we had to follow that up and prepare for the last one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we closed as it ran out of time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that fair

"speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you see , each made one , we didn't have enough yellow dough .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is the one that made .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it is curved , easy to hold , hand-held , and small with big easy buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is like scroll , but they are push buttons and they enter takes you into the different menus .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we need someone who's experienced with the television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is the infrared thing that's gonna zap at the television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm not quite how to make that , but i'm it will work .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is on off switch , 'cause we do need that , and it gives it balance .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it in there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as for what it's actually made of the function of these buttons is up , down , left and in the different menus .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "position , presume that just means on it , easy to see .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the main feature of it is just simple design , simple , lack of buttons all over the place .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "form curved , smooth , hand-held , makes it feel to hold .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "material , kate's gonna tackle that quite bit , but we have two different options , because we did make another one , which wa is in the shape of banana , it's just if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of banana , which is also and easy to hold and feels good and has similar scroll push button technology , just slightly different design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also with on off switch and infrared had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so like , what's it like ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like an existing remote control , but molded and smooth .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "whereas otherwise we'd thought , like with this one or mix and match , just we were gonna see what you thought , the more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we have the two options we can follow , either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber , depending on cost restraints .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and what we , what conclusion we reach when we discuss it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "material , that's what have to say about material .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can scroll down on there and see what else colour , definitely have preference towards bright yellow with black buttons , because that's the company colours , but if anybody's got any other suggestions , i'm quite willing to consider them as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , it just depends what you think about these ideas and if i'm , kate , you better say what you think about them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't have very much to add .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the case , that's the on off button just come off our prototype .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the case can be either spongy rubber or hard plastic .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're not about combination of the two , but it can be either of those .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have the technology to do that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and as for the actual components , steph just said this is quite cheap device to manufacture .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have simple rubber push buttons which provide all the functionality we need .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the diode that actually does the infrared is at the end , it's the stalk of the banana , or it's just the thing at the end of this version .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's for material .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "colour , steph's the expert on colour .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we don't have any particular restrictions on that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's all we've got to say really .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "thin as for the fruit or organic theme , this one is fruit shaped .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this one has banana , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this one has no obvious connections to fruit , but because it's round and molded , it kinda makes you think organic , touchy-feely , kiddie , it's more like , you'd expect it to be like child's sorta toy remote control instead of real one , which quite like that image .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause it's very big and chunky and child-friendly and hold them , you see , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would you care to examine the prototypes , see how they feel in the hand ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "curvature , is it to your liking ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "see , the on-off's in the back .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then you can use your thumb .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it was partly we thought the design looked better , but it could be moved if marketing feel it's important to have the on off button in different place .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "could see this thing , unless it's reinforced , having problem with the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you see , that's why hard plastic would be quite good thing for it , because then it'd just be rigid .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like the fact that on both of them the keys play such prominent role .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we really like we really like that design , it looks just like logo , that arrangement of the keys .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like compass point , just up , down , left and , and we think we could make that quite good feature .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it's like the ipod scroll wheel , but better .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it's also like texting , you don't .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", it that's what it makes me think of , mobile phones , was try was thinking , moving your thumb like this , what does that remind me of ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it's very simple design , there's not lot to wrong , the components are cheap to make .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's also in terms of being lost it's quite it looks quite different .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have several four remotes , and they all look the same until you get up close and you have to , this is really identifiable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the thing is we do need to develop our technology of actually how to program the menus and what , text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen , but we do definitely think that it's viable option .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the next item is evaluation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if that's if you're finished .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "shall take your power ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is going to be heavily interactive evaluation , and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by the consumers as incorporate all of our insight into this evaluation exercise .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so i'm going to go and use the whiteboard , and i've made list of criteria to look at , and so i'm gonna leave this up as the last thing , but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria , so one true seven false and i'm gonna now use the board .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so fancy , technologically innovative , easy to use , trendy , buttons , excess buttons , good buttons , ugly , sellable , and other .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and hope that you all introduce some additional terms , because these are things that have been brought up , some of them seem rather close , like they overlap .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what about price , is that gonna go on there as ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "price of materials .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we'll put price up at the top .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not that we actually know anything about it , but we can pretend .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "will soon , unfortunately .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so did you say ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it depends what you mean by fancy really , 'cause when of fancy , of it's got lots of extra fripperies and , like baroque curliness and which i'd call these quite minimalist , simple and plain , but do see what it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality , so in that respect it is quite fancy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , plain , simple , clean design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so in that respect we'll go with that respect .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just we need different word other than fancy , i'd say aesthetic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have got trendy further down , but elegant , if i'd call them elegant .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no these aren't the exact terms that the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like stylish or aesthetic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we're gon let's use elegant , although the people , the word on the street is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that the is fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "did you just break the pen ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so let's take it to the next level .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we'll just call it fancy then .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so in terms of elegant , fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we'll call it e_f_ , do we think that perhaps and we should say the yellow ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "should we go with the yellow in terms of that's really superior they're both .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we need to they're both yellow with black buttons , it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent that , but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just purely blob or some abstraction in between the two that isn't that is more curved , like banana , but that isn't actually recognisable as banana , with the grooves and the stalk and , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and of the two really like the banana , but do like the chunk .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's not something we have to decide just now , is it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , but in terms we have to evaluate one of them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just somewhere long the scale of in between these two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "unless do you wanna evaluate both ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "between the two , somewhere between the two is true .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'd don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's more true than false , about two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we say true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we'll say false .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one , is that inappropriate ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "trendy , and say specifically spongy fruity .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "only two or three then , 'cause it's no we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific , don't really think that's gonna work , but no .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have the worry about how robust it will be if it's curved as banana but spongy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "are there excess buttons ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's false .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that is false .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "good , designed buttons , intuitive buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "better , more intuitive buttons , yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "people don't respond to ugly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "sellable , quirky , something people like , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they're different , aren't they ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is quite it is quite quirky .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it could be quite good brand , like good little object .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and was thinking of other things in terms of could we say it's cost saving ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "with the , with the energy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we also need tho think about the energy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is it the kinetic energy ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it's it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it is going to be kinetic ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we'll say it's cost saving enviro .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we haven't completely developed that side of it yet , so we're not completely about that , but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you're still in the play-doh stage .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "including price , do you have any idea about price or other features ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we haven't got lot of expensive components in there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , the instinct says true .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so true one or should go to two or three ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'd put it at one , but , what do you , true , it might be the , true .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would say two , 'cause we still we need to get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus and things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's not just like it's not like ev , on normal chunky remote every button res means something different , whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all they mean everything , depending on what menu you're in .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's not cheap thing to get .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's good point .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we need somebody to develop that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "anything else you can thing of ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and i'm gonna actually change couple of these so then i'm gonna instead of ugly i'm gonna say it's attractive and then make that true , so that 'cause have to do an average .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then excess buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just putting no excess buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we're doing really .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "be , so it doesn't ruin the polarity .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as for see if we're technologically innovative , i'd say it is quite innovative , because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition but we are at the upper end of the push button market .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you let me if any of these if you all can think of any other thing to change here if you should change the innovative or add other features .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if not i'll average those .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , how about if pass this back to you and i'll figure out the average here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're little over halfway through the meeting and the next big thing is the finance .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for everyone's help with that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and as you can see it says the same thing , it had not lost itself , thank goodness .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we're going to raise

dynamo , battery , kinetic , solar cells .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just kinetic then , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what's hand dynamo ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that was the crank ,
