[{"edus": [{"text": "agnes , you can help me for the slide when .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "hope you have fresh head and fresh time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how now the meeting actually we gathering here to discuss about the functional design meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we'll issue some information from all of you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it's in the , in the sharing folder .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and will invite the christine and the ed and agnes to discuss about on the various subjects .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so can you go to the next slide ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the agenda of the meeting is opening .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then i'm going to talk about the project management , what i'm going to do , and , i'm doing the project management and secretary both , to take the minutes of the meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and there are three presentations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one is new project requirements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the second one about decision on remote control functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and finally we are closing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the meeting time will be forty minutes , so you have to be very quick .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and have come up with the management come with the new proposal , and have to discuss few points on this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "both says new insights in the aim of your project .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the one is the teletext becomes outmoded , because if because of the computer systems and the new technology .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we don't need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the second one is about the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should be used only for the t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's what our management says .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the third point , it's very important to establish our marketing or corporate image , with this new project or new product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so will invite agnes , can you go to the third slide ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , this is the third slide .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , i'll invite christine to discuss about the functional design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you wanna open the i'm number two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you're participant two ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you want the mouse , or do you want me to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll do the notes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so figured we should identify some user requirements , and from my experience , wanna , and from research did , the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button , you can't have like waffling on this point , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "really have it needs to be able have to be able to find it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , also , since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product , thought we better look at things that are popular and ex go beyond those , and , as said in the first meeting , and then we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in the construction , especially in the outside of the product so that it gives the appearance , and it is reliable , and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "did little history on the remote controls and when they were invented and , so , this guy zenith created the flashmatic , which kinda like the idea , 'cause it made me think of the remote control made big flash when you turn the t_v_ on and off , that might be interesting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so it was highly directional flash light that you could turn the picture on and off , and the sound on and off , and change channels so those are still requirements we have today , fifty years later .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it was really pioneering innovation , but it was sensitive to the sun , so that it would get would start off by the you'd get it would easily problems .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , in addition to looking at the functional requir so all these devices are examples of where they represent examples that are available today which the one in the middle is really something to keep in mind .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it'd be easy to find .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it would you'd you could throw it at things if the t_v_ didn't turn on and off , you could use it else .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and since i'm not really industrial designer , didn't really to do with this slide .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but took some different schematics and put them into this , and this is what slide might look like if you were drawing circuit board .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "why we were asked to do this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , personal preferences , we could i'm really thinking outside the box here , and that we should consider perhaps having an size remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so something that's very flexible and inflatable and then you could shrink it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it could either be you could go either one extreme , be very colourful , or you could make it clear , and blend in with things , so you didn't have to have problem with the decoration of the user's home .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it needs to be waterproof , because sometimes they fall into cups and , it might be out by the swimming pool like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you mi one of my requirements was about needs to tell you when it's done its job or not , because half the time , keep pushing on the remote control , and if it's actually understood my message , so it should give you some an oral cue .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , course never wanna replace the battery .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , that's those are my preferences , and that's my presentation .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let me interrupt you if you can add other facility , other feature , like unbreakable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because especially today , you have the family and the kids , and the kids throw it and they play with their remotes and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "run over it with car .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if you can add the feature , for your fabric whatever in your outline design , with unbreakable , that will give lot of advantage for our product , if i'm not wrong .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "good idea , i'll yes , very good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can add it in that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "christine , and any questions or clarifications , or any discussion on the functional design ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause , in the unbreakable thing , doing something plastic would be harder , whereas having something like , steel or titanium isn't really economically viable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "titanium would be heavy , too , wouldn't it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , haven't really wanted feedback , we need to rate rank these , but we'll see what your personal preferences are and your thoughts .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , wondering whether that you had any .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but who said we were , nobody told me how mu what our financial objective is , so it'd be hard to inflate something ou made out of titanium though .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the marketing comes out .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the i'm because the last meeting we supposed to discuss about the financial thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let me go quickly , if go back .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "know the project plan and the budget .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so close this , not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was in this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so let me see where is this file .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is christine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's mine , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's yours , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "verbally we can sell .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "will send you mail , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the project may be the project aim , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "at the end of the day , the company wants to make at least the fifty million euro .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the price will be very reasonable on the sales side .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that eddie will talk to you about how much the price and what's how much its cost for the manufacturing and how much it's going to be we sell in the market .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then you can come back with your feedback .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and have one the suggestion or opinion .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this remote control , it can be for like universal , to use for any t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it will be slim , and not fat .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not fat , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "might be hard to find , though .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but let's try it , with the different the designs , the functional designs .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so any other questions ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "from her side , don't think there's too many more questions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you can come to the , from the marketing , from the marketing side , just to give an idea what the management is looking for , was looking for remote control to have sales price of twenty-five euro , with production price of twelve and half euro .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "christine for time being , so then ed , so can you tell about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'scuse me for one sec .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for what from what we're trying to find , we're tr we're looking for , don't think that price is exactly in the market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll explain myself here now in the sense that in the recent surveys , from the ages fr from fifteen to thirty-five , eighty percent are willing to spend more money as fancy as trendy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "twenty-five euros , that's preson reasonable price .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's market price now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now if we're gonna take risk , and push this up bit , make it more expensive , but give them added things that they don't have now , then it could possibly sell .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the risk is there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "too expensive , they're not gonna buy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , there's one other thing interesting two things that are interesting is that from the fifteen to thirty-five year-old group , which always spends more money on trendy new things , speech recognition is requested .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we're talking between seventy-five to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can't make remote into computer , but simple commands .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "louder , softer , on , off .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that might be possibility , even though it costs more , to be the first on the market to produce this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "thirty-five percent say they're too difficult to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we have to figure out way of making it more user friendly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fifty percent say they can't find the remote half the time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so one word speech recognition commands , say remote , and there's beep , and they can find it through , ten tons of newspapers , magazines , whatever you have at home .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , in the cost that the management is looking for , that's not gonna be possible .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but if it's trendy , if it's fancy , it's got some colour to it , if it's very easy to use , if it's got simple remote speech remote control , like said , louder , softer , change channel , on , off , remote , it goes beep , find my remote without spending half day looking for it and getting all upset 'cause 't turn the t_v_ on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we're gonna have to look at it in this global idea , with the ideas of the industrial design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , price we have to talk about .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what do you think about the design ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you think you can make it or what do you think about the design , what he was talking about of the speech recognition ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "training is always an issue with commands .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so might we can perhaps do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process , it could reduce the overall cost .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but anyway , also that this might impact the battery life .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so , what we'll have to do is add something where you can recharge it wirelessly so that sen send power to it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so or set it out in the sun and it , gets , from the light , solar cell inside there so that you have enough juice to do all these fancy things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it seems also like with the speech recognition , it's feature , but if you're watching t_v_ , there's lot of ambient sound , and it's words .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's not just , noises like something hitting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's actual speech , so then you have to make that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the t_v_ speech , and the user's speech .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "otherwise , you can say remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if someone on the screen is saying the same thing , all of sudden , you have someone in movie saying off and your screen dies , because they've triggered the remote control and it's turned off your t_v_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , if we can find speech recognizer that can handle those types of problems , then , it'd be really good marketing gimmick .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , we need to consider how that would impact the situation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "very good point .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because tha with speech recognition i'm not that good at that idea but if it's one-word recognition , 'cause know with telephones and cars and things i've seen in the states , friend of mine says call mom , and it calls up mom .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the radio can be on and everything .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because with speech recognition , if the remote or like the telephone it has exact word that it has to hear .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't would come through sentence in television .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if somebody's speaking on the se the television , they're not gonna stop and say remote , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that something could be designed to recognise single word like the telephone .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , it's idea if we can design it to suit those requirements .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no because this is years ago in the united states where we're driving down and he said call home , and the telephone called immediately so , that's kinda cute .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what suggest to you , christine , if you need some the technical feedback , or some training , about this facility , especially for the speech recognition , recommend you some companies like intel or i_b_m_ , because they're already in this speech recognition part , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you can have some technical backup from them , some technical tie-up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if you want , coordinate , to get some information , and you can let me know , so what the details you require , to add this feature in this project .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't t's the difficult .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop , apart from what today .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll find that out .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "from your side , you're gonna have to go back the management and be more precise .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what do they want ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "risk , take risk on the market ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "something that's gonna cost more , but could very easily make boom in the market ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because it has to be something different , has to be total new .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "something that nobody has now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but end of the day , you're the sales guy , so will come back and sit on your head because you are going to give your sales projection , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it's gonna cost .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's good to tell the management how much it's cost us and how much you are going to benefit , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , so don't mind to convince , the management to spend some more money on the project , if you can make out of the money from this project .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if the bottom line is positive .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , don't mind to convince the management , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the management says , so they don't want certain facilities , which it's already worked , they want something new , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like speech recognit definitely they will agree , don't think they'll say no for that , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and hope convince the management on that , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if you have any new ideas , for your you can always come up and you can tell me if you need any special , coordination , between any technical companies , which you can hide their technology backup , for your functional design or technical design , then am ready to do that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and what's your comments about , so you are finish , ed , so , i'll hand over to agnes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", if go through my presentation , you can see what the user perspective is , and how it ties into the other two comments .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just gonna close this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "where are you , here ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "nope , here good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that's fine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , in our case , existing remote controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then , what the good ideas are , and what the bad ideas are , and why they're bad and good , which isn't always as obvious .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad , but when you look , technically , at how it works , sometimes that's not the case .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep , 'cause that'll feed into both ed's work and christine's work .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then what the remote control should look like , once we've got good idea of what the functionalities are .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , in terms of the functionalities that we need , you need to be able to turn the t_v_ on and off .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you need to change channels , both by directly going to specific channel or by channel surfing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you need to be able to control the volume and then control any menus on the t_v_ to regulate contrast or whatever .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls , in general .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "often , you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done , which you don't necessarily always remember , especially if it's functionality that you don't use very often .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that the buttons are too small .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , here we've got two examples where here on the left-hand side , you can see remote control that has lots and lots of buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the buttons , in lot of cases , are tiny .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they're hard to see , and , they're labelled , but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "whereas , on the other side , you have much simpler remote control that has the minimum functionalities that are needed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , would be inclined to go towards this , in terms of design , rather than this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons , then we can figure out how to do it with existing buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to limit , or to minimum , make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed , so like the on button being really obvious one , the channel changing and the volume , and to keep the design sleek and simple .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which , ties into what christine and ed have both said fairly reasonably .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , that's it , an if you have any questions or .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's , seems very understandable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "clearly your research and ours heading in the same direction , and the only thing that saw missing from your research that we found was this ability to find the doggone thing when you need it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , that's true .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , but that's .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's why we're all here at the table , so that if we think of it and our research indicates certain things and we it's complementary .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "also think that the feel of it is , when you hold it , is something that was expressed more in my design and that's logical and normal 'cause those are the parameters that an industrial designer's more thinking about , the look and the feel , and , you're first .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's definitely very important factor , especially to users who are gonna be buying the thing and then using it almost on an daily basis in lot of cases , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so don't have any questions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so for anybody need any help , for time being , on this subjects , so come back to me , and christine , try to help you to get some the technical the companies to help you for make design slim , and to add some features , like we are talking about , the speech recognition and all .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should we make decision about what features we actually want to include , 'cause we've thrown lot of features onto the table , but do we actually want to incorporate all of them , or have we missed anything ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you wanna go back and look at the closing slide , that would provide some guidance ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "doesn't really tell us .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so not really this one we are talk ab .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "says individual actions , it says user interf so i'm supposed to do the components concept , supposed to work on the user interface concept , and you're supposed to keep watching the trends .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and specific instructions will be sent by our coach .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we should do as many features as start with all of them now and eliminate them later in the process , that's my suggestion .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , i'm just thinking in terms of time , like if yes , now i'm objecting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that will be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and i'll send you the minutes of meet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can object if you want to we should take that as an action item for after the meeting , 'cause our meeting time has run out .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it takes lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features , and if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use , it's better to spend it on the thinking more about features that we actually do want , but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we still have .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "somebody else has go to use this room , and , we can't hang out here and talk about this , so very much .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what we'll do is now we'll take for lunch break , then we can discuss furthermore , with our areas , and then we will come back again in the next meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so for coming and i'll send you minutes of meeting , and put your all information in the sharing folder so everybody can share the information .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so let's go for lunch then .", "speaker": "A"}], "id": "xxxxx",
