pounds , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's about , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one point four like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one point four euro would make pound like that .",

about twenty pounds anyway .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , i'll be able to pull it up , or could put it in the shared folder .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , it'd still be , we had to buy one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price , we or is it going to make our product look cheapie-cheapie option ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "production cost's at twelve fifty , so half of the selling price is taken up by building it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "pretty huge margin .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and profit aim is fifty million euros , which is yi yes , presume so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in our first year ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be accessible and usable by all age groups just we're not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it's everyone user-friendly to everyone .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "big target group .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so yes , don't think we have to don't t's case of worrying about different languages and things like that , making that key point , just that it's going to be in the international market like australia , america , things like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what are your experiences with remote controls ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i've got we had three videos , t_v_ and amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls , that you programme each of your things into , but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that , you wanna integrate everything into one like .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it was quite cheapie as , so that might have had something to do with it , but that was quite good , the fact that you could you didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "use all the ones at the same time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "my experience has only been being given the remote control with the object buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme t_v_ and videos and things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , that basic functions , don't could go any further with it than that , so , suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the main that's the main anyway , and you don't want to hate looking at control and seeing million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the teletext button like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and symbols that you don't necessarily understand , symbols you're meant to understand that you don't .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so simplification of symbols you could think of .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when they're when you've got the main things on the front of it and section opens up to the other functions where you can do sound or options recording , things like that inside it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause it doesn't make when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at , it's obvious what you're doing , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "actually that just raises point , wonder what our design people think , but on mobile phone , you can press key and it gives you menu , it's got menu display , wonder if incorporating that into the design of remote control might be useful , so you've got little display .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "menu , alright .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many buttons and make it complicated for the user , may have an di display like that , like mobile , and with menus .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with menus , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if it's somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what about the older generation ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what about granny and grandads ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he couldn't even dream of texting like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you mean to save it lesser number .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't think they tape things , don't think they use , the age gap .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's problem regardless of any design modifications you come up with , that's gonna be problem anyway with the older generation perhaps , and that's another issue how we tackle that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what it just needs to be as long as it's self-intuitive and you can work out what everything's doing , 'cause , menus on new phones now they've got all these pictures and which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't like the , the new phones that have got windows-based running system .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "find it really confusing , kept getting lost in the phone , di i've not got new one but my friend got new one and was trying to do things with it and kept getting lost , but that's just me .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't how for twenty fi , or twelve euros fifty how much of excellent screen you could get , you'd have to keep it down to black and white thing anyway , i'd assume .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is it possible that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "teletext has got that option as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or what about dual function ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things and also and then menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone design features again , it could have flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is you can have bigger screen in the flip over .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's cost thing , don't how much we're gonna know about yes , no that's important .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it might save bit of space , it's instead of looking bulky , it might look small .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it might have its cost implications .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "something that's easily moulded and produced .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm treading on your territory .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", we've got half an hour before the next meeting , so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's probably about it and then we'll come back and liaise again and get to do another fantastic powerpoint presentation .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just quick thing about the about what you're saying about the does it need to be fashionable ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the had quick look at the company website and it's like the we put the fashion into electronics , so think the whole design thing might be qui you don't you can still have plastic and it'd look quite good but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , it doesn't have to be that , that was my main point , we don't have to use metal , if using plastic does make it cheaper , presume it would .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would it would probably .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's sky remote controls and everything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they're moulded and look bit different , and the telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks bit smarter , so that's we can think about .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so let's break it up there
