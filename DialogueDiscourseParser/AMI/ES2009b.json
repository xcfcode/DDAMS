email as but it needs to be television only .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so no we're not doing d_v_d_ , we're not doing anything else , it's just gonna be television remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it also needs to have the company colours included in it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's red and black .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it has to have the slogan , case you forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and no teletext .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm not what teletext is but i'm assuming you do , so we don't wanna include that in this particular design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for reasons that don't really know .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's but it's the board so there you go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our can sacrifice more function for better television remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'm gonna turn over to the industrial designer to go ahead and make presentation on , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so do unplug this bit here ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "gotta plug you in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "might have to hit function eight but it looks like it's gonna come up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's page one of my presentation .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for your first powerpoint it's lovely .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the method .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res successfully complete this project .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "remote control works as follows .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is all pretty basic you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "sends message to another system , so there's an energy source involved in that like battery or solar power , something along those lines , there's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , and that actually compose the messages and usually the way remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "user interface controls the chip , that's the casing and the buttons and accordingly the messages as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so my findings , did preliminary study here and found that too much metal in remote design could potentially interference with the ability of the remote to send commands .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and too much metal can remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "therefore suggest primarily plastic construction .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just some ideas that had , energy source , it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the user interface , was since we can't use metal was thinking high grade recycled plastic .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the chip , silicon based chip don't really see any way around that , we can't really be different in that respect .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the sender 'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard , multi channel , that's word made up , don't really it means .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "pal and n_t_s_c_ compatible and probably two hundred foot range .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the receiver is any number of electronic devices .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but in this case it'll only be t_v_s .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "personal preferences , really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of certain aesthetic value , 'cause we were thinking .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is there way that we can use modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics that do have some aesthetic value like if white like if we talk about like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use pretty , you can do is there some colo der quality plastic that we can work with ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it needs , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that shouldn't be problem .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the end of my presentation .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "very much nathan .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if next we can have the user

.", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "looks like you're in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is it plugged in ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there it goes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here we have my technical functions design presentation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so few of the requirements we need here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal and possibly operate several different types of devices although we now find that that's no problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "couldn't get that to use before .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so some of my findings .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wanna send messages to television set .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that would be any number of different things such as switch on the television , switch to the next channel , that thing , we're all quite intelligent and know normal remote control does .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now some of the other things found is complicated remote control that we can't quite see my red there very but this remote control has many functions so it can do lot of things but it is quite complicated and most users will find it find that they won't use most of the functions because they how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "look at that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as you also notice it's quite boring design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "another remote control , slightly different , it's simpler remote control many less buttons but has many fewer functions , much easier for the user to manipulate and use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it also has bit of cheap look and it's also quite boring .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so my personal preferences .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "revolutionise the idea of remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so attain the functionality of complicated device but use simple formatted display for the user to work with .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and was gonna add another slide here but didn't quite have time there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like having multiple face but it's .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for that ron .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does that mean i'm up ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "plug you in .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that would be perfect .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "slide show up and running .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "give it little bit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this is me .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had usability test where we were actually sort like watching hundred people use t_v_ remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general t_v_ remote control practices .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , the majority of the time that's all that's going on , the other functions happen , for some people they're important , but the primary uses are really basic .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use , they're not using lot of it , they don't need it , they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they what to do with .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we also found out that fifty percent of our people , their the worst thing about remote is how often they lose it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then they can't find it in the room .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what we were talking about with pager , will really come into play with lot of these people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there's also survey about what they liked about remotes , and they all think they're hideous and not very useful , and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if that's something we're ready to look into technically , that's up to the design people , but it is something worth thinking about , especially since the younger demographic's the one that's gonna keep growing , so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it really is the primary functions and getting it to look , which are the standards .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's good start for us .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "need to unplug this ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so i'll just switch that back here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "need it back .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll finish up with just bit of discussion plan on for the next phase .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we've covered most of these important questions through this through you guys's presentations we've got the industrial designer suggests or emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "sarah , she's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions but we need to decide who are we selling this to , you your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control , so do we wanna go for that , or do we want to go for an older demographic , and my thought is we've got if we're gonna go for sleek look we are putting the fashion in electronics .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're not catering to the pensioners of the world don't .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this we should look into this younger demographic .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we need to wonder about how we make it better and smaller and faster think we're constrained to plastics very , we've got this idea , ron was saying we need to think about revolutionising the way it's looking , which might be easier given that we're going for simpler function and that we're only going for telly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how this voice operation thing is good idea assuming that it's doable , at least for the basic controls , we can balance it that way , we can see .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can't say record alias tonight at seven p_m_ but we might be able to say volume up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it would be possible to combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that could work .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "with simple command like locate .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then it could start to beep and therefore be found .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "something very basic .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is that only gonna be within our two hundred foot range then ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's very doable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the difficulty wh would be in like you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have something that picks up voice from far away if it's hidden under the couch but then again you have this wee thing that's just little chip or whatever that has the page button , that could be voice activated too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's good point .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "little sticky pad to stick on top of your television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you just say something to into that and it finds your the other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of remote control and put the more complicated things into voice control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or an isolated magnet like , or something that wouldn't interfere that'd be the technical thing but like that , like that , the voice recognition for the paging system .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the younger market could use the voi voice control method and the older market might exactly and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "making it just an option ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was thinking go ahead .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "are we still thinking about this screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing , it would be still , do we that's an option technically now to that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'s definitely an option technically .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've looked into costs of touch screen methods and what not , they seem to be almost as cheap as button method at this point .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these four or five basic functions , you can have menu options to have all these other complicated voice recognition , settings , things that you're not gonna use every day and that lot of people aren't gonna use but it is an option there for this hi-tech market that re is the sleek thing we're going for .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "gotta wonder though , if we're adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty euro goal for selling these things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "worth looking into .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it seems like , we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the microchip is probably the most expensive part of the whole mechanism .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's just something to consider .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we'll cross that bridge in la slightly later stages of development but know , that's perfectly viable question .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'm seeing that we're gonna just focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , but then in sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but we'll make sleek simple functioned remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this voice recognition thing is we've got market for it don't think there's too many , we'd more or less be cornering the market on it as , we don't have many .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "appear to have lost my microphone .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we don't have many people or there's not very many competitors out there that do that so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've touched on most of this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the idea of paging function , touch screen , and face plates .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the thing with see would there not be we'd have to sacrifice the face plates for touch screen ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm not that's sincerely correct , if you take the example of mobile phone that trying to pass portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just the casing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could have the casing , the face plates .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "back to the cost the material .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have to ask whether we're going to include certain number of face plates with the package ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's something for say we're including three or four face plates , it's gonna drive the cost up .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the other question is , if we do include them are we really in position to evaluate that market ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we haven't done any tests on face plates and whether see if there if there's even interest out there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "off the top of my head it sounds like gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause then ha you would have to who all it's not like with cell phones like where you have nokia model x_ and then ten people make face plates for it , we'd be just our model of pho of remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the publicity of face plate on phone is you have it out and around , it is emblematic whereas you're just sit at home , so unless somebody comes over to watch t_v_ true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "hopefully some people have people coming over to hang out at your house and most people have their televisions in the living room .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "alright can we can discuss that one further when we think about whether when we do costs and , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "true , if plastic is dead cheap and if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway we'll cross that bridge later but we will have to evaluate what's most important .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've had bit of discussion already on this thing , there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with touch screen interface ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that would be best .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's based on what sh on what you have all said to me let's go for plastic built or plastic cased 'cause tha that's easy on the cost , try to look for some high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and that's idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with touch screen for the basic functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we'll tha let's provisionally let's go for touch screen one with several submenus for possible extra that one put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do we have minute it occurs to me that if we have touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause it would have docking base ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but then again that costs as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "those new ones .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can we afford that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can we afford to include one of those ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and will somebody buy it if we don't ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't 't see anybody buying lap remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some new battery technology .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so let's go with touch screen with some cutting edge battery technology t's it's worth looking into , if not we can always default to just doing presented plastic simple so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for twelve euros ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can put the we could suppose we could put the basics on the centre easiest , people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the other bits and bobs go through menu we'll do the aesthetics .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we'll touch screen and the battery , focus on presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's with this voice recognition option as just as for the simple functions the on off , channels , volume , and small paging function .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging just some simple button that's just another infrared signal to the remote control and while to emit some paging .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so any comments ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "thoughts before we break into go into the next round of individual work on this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "since we're doing touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the actual interface part of it and things like that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what would be on that touch screen ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and logo or motto , 't remember exactly what you said .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the fashion do .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we put fashion into electronics .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's my understanding that if you were going to do skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then you're dealing with ports and cords and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "perhaps good idea but that one might just be and they just that one might just be out of the range for this particular p_d_a_ would they would makes lot of sense for p_d_a_ 'cause you're gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway but , what do you think ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'s too much .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "think we just need to come up with black and red interface on the touch screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm in agreement with that , i'm wondering how we're gonna get we put fashion into electronics onto this device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if we're gonna use touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading and then it goes away , perhaps it could be like temporary comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is bit much to have it like engraved on the back .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm hoping for subliminal half millisecond as it turns on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you would think .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it seems like it would suffice to have just the r_r_ on there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "jus but not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if it comes from above .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "people aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they just want it to be on and ready to go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that would help the battery life too and if it the remote they do have to press button for the remote to turn on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then again who wants to turn on remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if to wake up or go into like dormant mode .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "goes into sleep mode .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like that like the
