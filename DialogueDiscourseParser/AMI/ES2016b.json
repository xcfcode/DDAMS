[{"edus": [{"text": "du we yes i've lo i've done the role that was asked to do anyway .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for coming to this meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how we doing on our remote ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have some we have some ideas and some ideas for what people want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see if 't get things moving along here little bit better .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll go over what we went over last time , which shouldn't take long .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then believe each of you have presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i've was sent couple more requirements for our remote , what they want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we can come to conclusion on what we want the remote to do , and how it's going to do it hopefully .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we'll have the closing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which we'll have forty minutes for .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's see , the last meeting we went over who was responsible for what .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm responsible for leading the meetings , keeping the notes , and coming up with the final presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "corinne is our marketing expert .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "she's gonna figure out what the consumer wants .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ryan is our user interface designer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and manuel is the industrial designer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you're gonna come up with the ideas ryan , and you're gonna pick apart .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we decided our remote , we want it to be universal remote that everyone would want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we want to be modern , fun , different .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it needs to be sturdy , easy to find , so we gonna have that locator function .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we want to be different .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we went over couple of different ideas .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the keyboard shape .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we decided that it should probably be one-handed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "something we could use with one hand .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that was our last meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so why don't do each of you have presentation ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll hand it off to you and does anyone do you wanna go first ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can see what the people want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what was it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how do get it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to go to the next one ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you click on that guy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is my report , which is going to be based on survey that was sent .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "gosh , i've no idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just press the arrow keys .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "usually goes to it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "actually need to see something else on my screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "hit eight again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you want it to be on both screens , or just yours ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no want something else on mine .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is that possible ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you have to hit escape .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then you can .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but now you don't have that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "hit eight again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did the same thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then it should come up here shortly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so is there no way give you the slideshow and have something .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "give us the slideshow and something on your screen ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you could minimise that screen and then have them both up at the same time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so first of all , the method that used was by doing some marketing research , by doing research on some interviews that were conducted .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then some internet research .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and was sent report that was there were hundred remote users that they interviewed .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so will show you some of the results from that , which will be helpful .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "here are some of the findings .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which is fairly significant number would say .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get remote that would look fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be modern look , that's definitely important .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they say that current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "seventy five percent of users said they zap lot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if anyone could clarify what that means ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "zap , does that just mean like changing the channel ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is it just using it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and there was something else , they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and some of them it looks like barely need to be included .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "channel selection is used the most frequently .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then teletext was the next .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "volume and then power .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine lot of the functions into one button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere , and so tracking device of some sort would be good idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they said it take thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use new remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for r_s_i_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "repetitive strain injury .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what is it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just repetitive strain injury .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so bas .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as far as speech recognition goes , the younger group looks like they're all for it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "from the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it just went down incrementally .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the groups at the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay , so we could discuss this and think and decide if we t's worth investing in this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "at least if we're targeting the younger groups .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so in conclusion .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "some things that drew from this are that we were correct .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we definitely need to focus on new modern appearance , since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "multifunctional remote could be good thing to explore .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you only have one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons , get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then lastly that we could discuss the idea of speech recognition .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that's it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now we actually have some ideas of what people want , what we should focus on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can look at that real quick ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did you get time to write everything that you needed ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "having just listened to what corinne just said , i'll draw on some of the things as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "some things that relevant to what wanna say .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i'm just gonna approach the technical functions design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the method used was to explore the technical functions of remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and simplest approach that came to is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's an obvious thing to say , but it's not attached to the device that you want to control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "had some things sent to me .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not very much .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to look at similar devices .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "defined in some them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then the personal preferences that will suggest .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we discussed universal one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like it's just been brought up again then .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but universal remote control is actually quite difficult object to design , and po possibly within the budget that we do it , because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of all the like electronic companies .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm not have you ever come across universal remote control yourself , but you have to they're nightmare to use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have to set them , reset them to everything .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that would only add buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "whereas the aim is to take away buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it'd be better to concentrate on just universal one for t_v_s .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or just one that you could we could design and then different people , manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications , if the aim is to get something that's unique in design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "here here's just two pictures of remote controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they're just simple t_v_ remote controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but one is user-centred .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that is the one on the left .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you can straight away see there's less buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the other one is engineer-centred where that's more specified for the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control which appeals more to the product that we want , and on what the have said and the market research and probably looking at something that should be user-centred .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "fewer buttons , simpler to use , and if ten percent is hidden away if ten percent is what's used , the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden under some remote controls you might have come across have little flip thi thing where they're hidden away .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and finally , sort i've covered that , our product should be user interface orientated .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like said to concentrate on t_v_ remote control , universal remote might be too complex .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and as what it , the major findings market researchers have said , it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that we should concentrate on something that would set trend .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then and change the fashion of remote controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that's it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what was your last conclusion on that one ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "focus on the image of it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "on something on the image of it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the actual design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors which is what dictates the design the both the interface and the outer appearance because this is all the that needs to go in there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so unfortunately the people who were supposed to do this little presentation for me were too drunk to actually accomplish it , so i'm going to do lot of the on the board .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just this is the basic premise of remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the basic function is to send messages to another system .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so much is clear .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like chip , that can compose messages .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "often in the form of infrared bits .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is the most mostly used .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's also some sound systems but infrared is the better or the more used system .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "parts are cheaper as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is where my people screwed up .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so i'm going to explain that on the board rather .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what we have is different components that need to go in there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we'll start with an energy source .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is usually battery ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "since it's not feasible to add cable to that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this energy source is connected to the user interface itself .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which can be buttons , whatever , which controls chip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is the user interface and there we have the chip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that sends out the signal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the signal differs accordingly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the way you normally do it is that you add little device such as lamp to the whole thing as , so that it's working .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you press something , you get response .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is also comparatively important on one of those devices .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now this , what we're talking about here , or what should be discussed are these two components mostly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the energy source for one thing can be altered .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what we probably cannot alter is the infrared , the sending device , the infrared lamp .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we cannot change the chip which controls the infrared lamp .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "these two are components that we have to use , and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the lamp can be put onto the desi the device .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it doesn't have to be there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this can be discussed as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the user interface .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's something we can also discuss .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as we've heard speech recognition is the hype in the moment .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "speech recognition interface , we that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or if we just do the usual button thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or we have touch pad like that that's something we can discuss .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the energy source .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's always question whether these components are available cheap enough , developed enough .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that's like suppose rather up to marketing , and not to the industrial design department .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we could the more complex we make it , the more expensive but people have said that they would younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for speech recognition remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "expensive it's gonna be get .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so possibly it might be worth the investment .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "speech recognition was one of those things where they have to be really good for them to work .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and if it's on your phone .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you need to take into light languages and then different dialects suppose as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "myself find , when you , when there's something like spee speech recognition .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "sometimes they have speech recognition on the other end , and you say one for this , and you find yours , like you said , saying the same thing over and over .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "find myself , especially if i'm in crowd of people , looking really silly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if you're sitting on your couch with bunch of people then , you volume up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and wou if would you want to keep saying if you were watching .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you were watching something would you be wanting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "change the channel , channel up , channel down ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they'd do it , but probably lot of them that's actually their parents money .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves , fifteen year old .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as t'd be the gimmick factor for the younger people .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but practically don't t's .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's , it's gimmick factor that they like at first , and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it'll wear off .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let's see here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you wanna put your cord back in ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now was sent couple of things to modify our new requirements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the remote's only gonna be for the television , which is good because we already decided your research showed that not only is universal remote more complicated , it's more cost , more costly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and your re research showed that most of the people don't even use it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you said fifty percent of the people only use half the or ten percent of the buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we don't have to worry about that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we do have to use the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan , which is we put the fashion in electronics .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and our corporate colours are grey and yellow .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we could probably get away with black too but so those are the three new requirements that was told we need to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "from all three of your presentations , that we were on the track lot in our last meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we want something that looks good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we want something that's simple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we want something that you can find easily .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the speech recognition is give or take .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's gonna cost more .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the young the younger people say that they like it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it's probably , would say , probably not worth the investment at this point in time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we should just do away with speech recognition .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that way we can focus on our form .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did have thought about the tracking thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is that if it came with holder or holster , whatever you wanna call it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that you should put it back in .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if you don't put it back in , you press something like little button on that , and that just sends out beep to find where it is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just by infrared .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that shouldn't be too complex would've thought .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that'd be , that'd be good if we were going with our ball .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it would be quite good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the ball could sit on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or with any form that would be good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that could be the charger .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that would be or solar .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or however , however you wanted to go about it , the holder could also be the charging unit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with the locator button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if it were the ball you'd no longer have to have flat space on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like if we still have the how to hold on to it and it's gonna roll away .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you still do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you put it on the couch table .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "while you're watching , it's gonna roll off .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's not an issue really .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so after the meeting we'll have some questionnaires .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and some summaries for what's going on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we'll take lunch .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we can come back and work on our individual work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll do the minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it looks like you're already on your way for working with the components .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "chips , the what chips we need and what how to power it and whatnot .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "user interface concept , we want it to be something simple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "minimal number of buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our , our main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on certain look , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did you have time earlier to work on that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did you feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll have look , try look at the actual appearance in the next break .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do still needs to be something that is ultimately one-handed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the ball is probably not good idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and even something that's held like that might be difficult .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that it still has to be variation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on rect on rectangle but not necessarily as boring , as plain as rectangle .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "shall we shoot for specific target group ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that way we could if it were , if we were shooting for young then it's certain look to the remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or girls or older people ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would that you think that would help us find specific form ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that we would wanna pick out ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if that might cope with like the trend-watching .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "find anything more on that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not yet but by the next meeting we'll have some info on that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we know that the remote's gonna have to be we'll just say we've got colour scheme for it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yellow and yellow it's and bright , with the buttons being grey or black .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and our slogan pasted somewhere on it , on the bottom or the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could sketch so all of our remotes all of our typical remotes now are just rectangular sort .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could flare it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's more this will look like bone then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "go ahead and erase this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "hope everyone memorised that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you it might be to look at the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones , and the shapes that the they've been going .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they've gone from big brick block things , which is remote control is , to slinky small things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "everybody's got mobile phone ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "except for me now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but they are all , mobile phones they've taken turn to where they're really small .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then again you don't want like the first mobile phone that was this big and you had handbag to carry it around in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we've got what remotes look like now is what we're stuck with .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could go with square .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with minimal number of buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you've got one through nine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for typing in your channels .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you've got volume , up and down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "channel up and down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "usually at the top .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's the classical design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's all you need .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "menu button , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you , if we want the remote to do other things like or the t_v_ to be able to change the tint and the colour and all those things that are built into t_v_s , we just have that under one standard menu button where you go in , press the menu button , scroll up and down to select it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "talking of which scrolling function is not too bad .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's talk about look at that from the side , there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is technically the easiest option .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would probably be like scrolling , little scrolling wheel like this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like wheel on your mouse .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can even if we're coming from mice , we can even add click function , where you , in order to verify the information you just press it down .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'s good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing , if you wanna make it square for the looks of it , then to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing , you add little bulge down here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just which from an engineering point this could be holding the batteries and so on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what i'm getting at here , fel look at it from the side .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then you hold it in your hand like this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you bring the buttons nearer to the or the imp more important buttons nearer to the side .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes to the thumb .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to the thumb .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the buttons could like decrease in the bigger ones they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important , the smaller here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can also have it , talking about mobile phones again , sliding open .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "with the lesser used functions on this part , and then it slides into that part .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just like on side view .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "something that it would fit in the hand better .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you just have your hand .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was just thinking , this causes problem for left or right-handed people actually .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "on the and your thumb would be up here type thing .", "speaker": "C"},
