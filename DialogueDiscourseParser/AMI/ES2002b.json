[{"edus": [{"text": "is that alright now ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "everybody all set to start the meeting ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "could you plug me in ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "all ready to go ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so hopefully you've all been working away , and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so just to recap on what we did last time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "got to know each other little bit and got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss bit about the project , cost-wise how much money we had to just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the first one is that the company's decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they've also suggested that we only use the remote control to control the television , not the v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ or anything else .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect how long it takes us to get it into production , the time to market .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the t_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm not entirely what the corporate colour is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it might be yellow , because there seems to be lot of yellow everywhere .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's the thing , i'm not because on the company website , what does it say something , do they is that something they want actually written on it , 'cause it's quite long .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'bout putting the fashion in electronics .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or , just the idea , but i'm not .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's something we can discuss as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so those are the three things , just not to worry about teletext , only control the t_v_ , and incorporate the colour and slogan of the company .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so is everybody with any of that , or do you want me to recap ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "nope , we're all set .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "time for presentations then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "who would like to go first ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll go first .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "alright , can st steal this from the back of your laptop ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is the technical functions design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "go on ahead .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to do the design have i've had look online , i've had look at the homepage , which has given us some insp inspiration from previous products .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've had look at the previous products to see what they offer and would like to ask you for your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "unfortunately we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting room , so , having look at the existing products , found out that it tends to come in two extremes , there's either very complicated one that's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you what you're doing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in that case the labelling tends to be very bad .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's an example i'll show you at the end , sh show you now .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "here the button there and there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this one's prog .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that one's perg and that one's prog , and it doesn't really tell you what it does .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not if you had look at the other control in that example .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's very simple one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's got only the basic functions but it's the same size as the hard to use one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it looked bit clunky .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they're very big and not very much use for buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's nothing for slow motion button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "my own preferences , prefer the clunky one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's very easy to use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions which quite like having on the controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so believe the advanced functions should be hidden in drawer , like tha from the bottom of it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , now i'd like to ask for your preferences .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not of how long we've got , the clunky one is the one on the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can chat away for five minutes or so at most .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just couple of minutes anyway .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like lot of what i've read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what craig's just gone over .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so in part could give you some of my personal preferences but could also add some to this which is just about market research .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but anyway , we might come to that later .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "shall we sh 'll stick to your area for now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "clunky in what sense , like heavier ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's supposed to be the same size , but it's got much fewer buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's , it's very spread out and , get the idea it'd be about this size .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "see , so it's more just basic .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "got very few buttons on it and , do we have any functions that we'd want on it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's valid point .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like the one on the left looks quite complicated , and that p_r_t_ p_r_o_t_ thing is incredibly confusing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so see why yo you might prefer the simpler design , but you don't want to lose out on , what it does , so you get lot of remote controls where you flip the thing open , that's good idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's good idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so far i've got on and off , switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they're just the very basics you could use for t_v_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then actual numbers for channels as , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you say that's required one or requested one ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which was that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would you like the channels like the numbers on thing , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "up the numbers , or the up down ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "wou would say that's required , there's no way anybody's gonna buy remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels , would anybody disagree with that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what else , so don't need to worry about teletext , don't need to worry about v_c_r_ , any like display controls do you think we need to worry about , like brightness and contrast ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "es essentially what we're doing now is we're categorising .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're saying want this to be product that offers all the more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is that what we're doing ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're like sorting them an or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to start with bit both , we need to find out exactly what we have to have and after that we can add things if they're possible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "are you thinking what we have to have and what would be ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you wanna just , at this point decide on what we must have as function of this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's on and off , volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one way would look at this would be that we approach the different controls in terms of like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and also think little bit about sorta what would just wanna be acc easily accessible .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they're un they're in little area but covered up , things like channel and volume are used all the time , so we just have them out on top , very just very self-explanatory .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , like one which are just the habitual ones that should be within your natural grip .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and others that are also available and then others that are concealed .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "something like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just to wrap up quickly on this little section have lost no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you think that's the only essential requirements , and then just things that would be if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , like mute button , that thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "any of you anything to add to that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll add it later , the presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we can move on to next presentation then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you wanna probably not , actually .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you want to switch places ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can this pl reach ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can this plug come across ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so why don't pick up and move then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "here , i'll just why don't er , can you go up behind me ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just switch them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "kinda this is so this i'm all in knot now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it'd be if everything was wireless , wouldn't it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so say already , whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be lot of redundancy in the issues and the things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like overlap between what you said ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for all that that'll happen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is ma not necessarily bad thing , but may what i've already started doing is cr created slide in my presentation here so that we think what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and mine , because certainly have hard time separating things completely .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts lot on what like market research that i've been so how do get this up ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "hard to where your role ends , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "pr , press function and eight , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "function , the blue button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "next to the control on the left .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have to push it together .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that that's doing it now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "try that again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "think the wire in the back might be loose .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you wanna here we go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just before bring this up what i'll just say is what i've done is tried to collect some information so that then relay this to you so that it's now becomes collective thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then lead us in the direction of deciding , what are our options , what should we decide and do what , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "increase that 'cause we can't see the that's much better .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can you , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so does that make sense ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what got is looked into some information and tried to think about how we could review it and how we could and what decisions we could take away from it and then by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause certainly there's lots of different information to go through .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so i'm thinking here about primarily about customer needs , that we start with the customer , and , what they want and what are issues with existing products .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to think about trends and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then , as say we'd like to prioritise our design features from this and dunno .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "bouncing on top .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is what i've found here , lot of this is new to me , so we'll just read through together .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so they find them ugly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "most people find them ugly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as , we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm gonna we'll look at that in second .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "most people use only very slim portion of all the controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what we're looking at here is people want this technology , they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't doesn't really appeal to them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what we're doing is we're trying to take like if for me this is sorta like three different inspirations , one is that we want something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they get lost lot , as it came up in our last meeting .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "takes time to learn how to use them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is why mention when craig was showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls , so it doesn't just look like big panel , kinda like when you look at , new computer keyboard , that is quite explanatory .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you want audio , if you want visual , then you have those .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and will admit what r_s_i_ stands for .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "repetitive strain injury .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is installing new remote control something that people , it'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , that did not come up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so here is another review here of the main things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "also found that most people would adults at least would pay more for voice recognition .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if that's possible we might consider getting into it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and here as we move thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this , recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "people additionally aren't liking the appearance of their products , so we wanna think about as we take all the techie features how we can put that into unit which is which people like .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so want something that looks good and is easy to use , big priorities .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so just looking at what craig craig's ideas are sorta tell me that what we wanna do is try and separate the different things that we wanna include in this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if we do say want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's like find lot of t_v_s these days , something really like about is if you wanna just turn on and off you can , but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it you wanna group all the different types of functions together , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's it's good idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the but i'm my hope here is that i'm putting out this information so that we can then say , how do we collectively move on with it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "haven't brought out one specific marketing idea , although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles , and then use that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but not let that confine us technologically .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "any comments on all of that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be who's our target audience , our target market .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if we want something that looks good and is easy to use , but has is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "who wou who would have the money to spend .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "where's the money , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if like twenty five euro is our selling price then you can imagine , don't i'm not really how much that will retail at .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and who watches t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you want it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , suppose , they're gonna actually go out and buy one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , who do you think we're aiming this at ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause twenty five euros for remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's about sixteen , seventeen pounds , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that too is that lot of money to buy an extra remote or replacement remote ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so not the high end range , but middle , middle up-ish .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you pay , what , ten quid for remote ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like simple replacement , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you lost your remote and the first thing you just wanna go out and get , would you how much would you pay ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this kinda touches on your comments there , david .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these are the age groups which we have information on and these are this is table of what people would pay more for certain feature .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just gives us rough idea of where the will to spend money on t_v_ equipment is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "mostly focused around the twenty five age group .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so do you think we're aiming at fairly young market then ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "young professional , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", it's the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "did you not say it was the adults that were going for the voice recognition ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you think then voice recognition is something we should really consider ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what do you think , craig ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the older group .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it does fit with the market that we're identifying , in terms of .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we are gonna have to narrow it down , to say let's target these people and give them what they want and 'cause , there needs to be some selling point to it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so anybody anything there to add just young professionals , like if we are going to include speech recognition , it's between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like really high response to that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we could say that was our target .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "twenty five to thirty five is fair to add that in as group as because that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they have bit of expendable income to spend on this thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "perhaps that age group is significant as because those are people who use the computer , who are familiar with their with computers in their everyday work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "people who are about wouldn't say thirty five , but people who are about forty-ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on computer or mobile phone like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so these are people who are gadgety , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "people who are growing up used to , in schools and in universities , when you go on to their working lives , people who would regular .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that that's good point .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so shall we make the decision to include speech recognition if we can .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we can .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition now , because , based on what you've go everybody's saying , you want something simple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "why is that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you want basic and you want something that's easy to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "could it be an on off thing ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but what i'm saying is that we're trying to lock ourselves into particular technology , rather than focusing on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like if you want it on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "where you can activate it and deactivate it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we should suggest that we think about speech recognition , anyway it's something that can be used to fulfil function , but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you wanna give us your presentation and then we can might have been good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss , but this is how we're , exactly , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's good t's good to get ideas out while they're fresh in mind .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's something that's just occurred to me as if we make it speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that's appealing to people with physical disability as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and not losing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and also it helps in terms of people not losing this , they they're saying it's lose it in the couch .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like we're what we're getting in into here is mating different design features together that they .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "reckon one problem with speech recognition is i've actually seen one of them used and the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing , so you end up yelling at the control for hours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "really , you've seen one before .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you think we need like further advances in that area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it'd probably quite expensive to put in .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you mind passing me my notepad .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is just the working design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is just what how would go about it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "try to define like what we're doing now , try to define what we're trying to get done .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in practical way , we it is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've used it , we're familiar with it , but we're we can't we haven't narrowed down exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like besides the basics , back in the back of our minds we the basics are .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "has to change channels , has to change volume , but in like specifics , which one of the basics are you trying to target .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the idea is just to get everybody to usually have design that's there as basic , so , things that to start everything going .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but everybody does have some idea , so don't think there's need for that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this finding things is little bit confusing , so i'll go into the diagram first .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it just explains how the process goes through , from the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need in the diagram and in this slide probably works better .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you need some power source .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "battery , to keep it going .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that power source is important because it ties you down to how long the device will last .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it ties you down perhaps bit later on in terms of the technologies how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like , voice recognition , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that might be constrained because that you might need to power microphone , you might need to power other things , so that's one perhaps constraint there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the basic thing is there's user interface where people punch button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes , whatever .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that picks up an input from user , logic series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , and the device has to , based on you push button , so will do something with button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so button is the power button , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's about it in terms of my design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's fairly general , and the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in the way you're thinking , like voice recognition , if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having thing that we don't have enough power .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's not really constraint in that sense , but these are functionally , the base , what the technology has to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the rest of it we should you wanna go back to what the functions are ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's more relevant to discussion ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you wan do you wanna finish up your whole presentation then ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "are you all done ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "more or less .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ps , it's just putting the rest of it into words , but it's essentially the same thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have transmitter , an input device , logic chip , like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this would be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and like on the means since we're on the topic of the technology , are there any like what are our options ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright , what's what in is this the only way that we go about it , or are there other thin .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these aren't technology options in that sense .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is just basic principles and basic components that are needed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the basic principle of .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you needed if you needed to add voice recognition , then your user interface would be split , broken down into more components , which you have microphone , the v_r_ and like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this just show how we're modularising the whole thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so each component represents one function , but the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter , and the receiver , and the power are things that you won't have to care about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and those are things that based on what your user interface requires then we'll add more functionality to it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there might be one other consideration which would be that the transmission between the remote control and the t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ll worry that was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would effect how long it took us to get this to market , so suspect it might be good idea just to restrict our creative influence on this on the user interface and not worry so much about how we transmit it because it it's tried and tested intra-red , so we could stay with tha , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there might be one other problem with the transmission , in particular now , since we're talking about voice recognition .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if somebody's gonna talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it you may not require that , but , it's something very natural , to hold it , to signal to the user , and push button to start talking about it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then you need to send the signal out , so because if you're using infra-red , the line of sight say the t_v_'s at that chair , and i'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so in that sense , there's not really restriction but it's something which you may have to think about later on in the process .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not so much further down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and just clarification before we finish this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "does is our controller is it have the option of being on standard frequency as all of the other equipment , so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there's not much specific information , but that one indication of infra-red mean that you're just targeting traditional devices .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because infra-red is something which everybody has .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ll we've in the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the t_v_ , so that's what we should do for now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just to t_v_ , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "something was wondering about was the power .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it worth considering like having like charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that something we really want to go into , do you think , or should we just consider running on regular batteries ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's , from component point of view there's added complexity , and you add cost to it , and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you need docking cradle , for you to put it in to charge .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or you need to get the user to plug it in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and most users are very use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but unless the controller's gonna consume lot of batteries , like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries month , then don't think rechargeable is something we should , we really need to care about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so just stick to regular .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the i'm just gonna just recap what said at the start , was that the whole point of this meeting was to finalise who we're gonna aim this at , and what exactly the product's gonna do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so just to recap on are we all happy about the idea of aiming the product at the fifteen to thirty five bracket ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and also the funct the actual functions of what it's gonna do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you wanna recap on that , craig ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we just say that it was gonna be the most basic possible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and skip to channel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and is it going to include any of the more advanced features , or are we gonna eliminate those ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we include mute , but apart from that we just we'll go for the simpleness .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it not an option still that we include some things just as under like under door or some 'cause what i'm i'd be bit worried about is if someone was had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then they , they get ours and it's doesn't have that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's as optional functions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if that'd be problem .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "could suggest we break them down into three simple categories .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one would be audio controls , one would be video controls , and the other one would be device .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this may not map very to advanced functionality especially , but that from manufacturer's point of view , from person designing the device , but from point of view of person using the device , t_v_ is something they see and something they hear , it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like so what we could have is like three buckets , where we could throw things into , like if we want this feature , let's throw it into there , and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it might help with the visualisation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it would actually help with the component build as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "gotta got five minutes to wrap up now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "next thing we're doing is having lunch .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then we're gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so i'll be putting the minutes of this meeting into the project documents folder .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so just to confirm that we we're doing in the next the thirty minutes after lunch anyway , for our industrial designer , you're gonna be thinking about the components concept .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "user interface designer gonna be thinking about our user interface , and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you'll all get specific instructions as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , just to ask now if you've got anything else you've thought about while we've been talking .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you wanna start with david .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "anything else to say ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , not really .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just wanted to ask then before we wrap up , shall we agree for sake of clarity and when we resume that we'll use this idea david's proposed , where we think of these three buckets and anything we discuss about them is , we're talking about this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's definitely good idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "shall we do that , then ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just about the three buckets , what would go in the device functions one ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "things like on off .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because they don't have anything to do with what you see .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "me mean in terms of picture and the entertainment value , so and channel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because the on off also goes , like on off like power , not on off sound .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not on off video .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "although you don't turn off the video on your t_v_ , but you might wanna turn off the sound , say you wanna pick up the phone , there's mute button , so you have choice of putting it on to others or device .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "device is anything which we can't categorise , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you're gonna have audio which is gonna be like your bass settings and actual volume hi .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we put it out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "anything to do with what you hear , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you put that into audio .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then visual , so brightness , contrast , things like that , and then just actual device things , like what channel you're watching , turning on an off , like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then video is anything that you can see .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then suppose quite likely what would happen is in the device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others which are bit more .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like random which we have no other place to put , but we need it somewhere there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "even if it doesn't map very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's easy to use , that's one thing that and from the component point of view it's easy to build as 'cause things are like fixed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , just things to think about are like the fact it's gotta look good , because of who we're , targeting this at .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "something quirky in design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "make it ergonomic to hold , things like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the meeting over .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then we get to go find out what was picked up for lunch for us .", "speaker": "D"}], "id": "xxxxx", "relations": [{"y": 1, "x": 0, "type": "Explanation"}]}]
