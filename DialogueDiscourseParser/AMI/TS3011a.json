control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "those are easy goals , and i'm we can find more goals for the product we are going to develop .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we will discuss later on more ideas about how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the market , we should have look at the market .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we are going to use pred project method during this development , which consists of three different design stages .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , all of these stages mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then meet to discuss our the progressions , yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the first stage , the functional design we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will make specific specification of that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the second is the technical functional design , what effect should the remote have ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this case control the television .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's for the vision .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the last one is the working design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how exactly does it work in the technical sense

now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can draw on the board using this pen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there are little sensors , so do not grab it here , but lit more little bit more to the end

"you can use the eraser to make something go away .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we all use the same white-board file so we can work together on it while we're or should we only use it in the meetings ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in the meetings , only in the meetings .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's really like regu regular whiteboard .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can choose the format , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let me see .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's because i'm not pen selected .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "current colour , you can choose another colour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and black , and you choose the line width .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so now have different line width and colour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "quite easy , if you do have any questions , just ask me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to , i'm wrote down the documents should be in the project documents folder if you want to discuss it with us .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as little training will ask ruud first to draw your own animal on new slide with different colour and different line width than the one now selected .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "roo , could you do the same ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , flores .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but different animal with different colour and different line width .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "sebastian is thinking about the animal .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm just guessing what should be my favourite animal .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm think about it too .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it looked more than bunny than cat , but it works , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it should be cat .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll give it try .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm guessing horse .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with very small legs .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was very good in drawing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you should feed that animal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you get the idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "any questions , just let me know .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "back to our project .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the remote control we are going to develop will have selling price of about twenty five euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the profit we are looking for this product is fifty million euros , which is quite number .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold , if there is market interest , in more than one country .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the production costs should not be more than twelve euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by during the development , because , those are important numbers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then the discussion , the time for sebastian to show his presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , have some technical issues which would like to present to you before we start the discussion , because there might be some influations influences .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "first about my role , role of the industrial designer .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would like to think about the implementation of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if someone of you comes up with ideas , i'll try to translate them in technical functions , but there might be some impossibilities .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also will propose some implementations for that , but , these are quite the same .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have some initial ideas about some things which are to take with you in the upcoming discussion .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one thing about interopera operability .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "modern remote control should control device diverse subset of equipment .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "d_v_d_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so one re one remote control for all your equipment .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and for cell phone ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it could come in handy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should discuss that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we should think about the way how these things should communicate with each other .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we're not living in the nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not really hot technical anymore .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you should think about the things like bluetooth .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , but the infrared , it's , little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it's cost-effective .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but all the t_v_s are equipped with infrared , so you can most of them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not all , not all .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's the point .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , but that's something we should discuss and about every everybody should think about it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or you shou sh use you should equip infrared and bluetooth together in one remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's just my role , i'll just give you everybody some technical input , and now the time is to have little discussion about what the product should be and how it should look , but take these things into account when you start the discussion .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the main por the main points you are telling us are focus on the inter operability , and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , so one thing one remote control should control one or more pieces of equipment , and the way of communicating with these equipments .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that was your presentation ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll go back to my own presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do t's time now to discuss some things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "sebastian told us few things about the technical implemen implications .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there are other things like how to make it trendy , which is most ru ruud's role .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is roo during this part .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so let's start with you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how do you think the remote should function for the user ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "had few things in mind .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the interoperability , just like sebastian said , the remote should work on different t_v_s or even different , what is it , devices ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's universal remote control for customers to buy just new in store .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , it should be something like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's not for philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we're going business to consumer , not we're it's not no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's no have don't have the information for it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're not developing this product for specific vendor , are we ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to very broad public , so it should fit to every device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ruud , do you agree ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the techni fu technical function what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the t_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's just the basic technical function .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that was my really my part for this session .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task as an device .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so is that ease of use or is that more like .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it just should change the t_v_'s state .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you see the buttons as means of doing this ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or are there any other controls ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "are there only any other cont , i've seen these remote controls with this little stick which you can move forward , sidewords .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or you want touch-screen or but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it's very easy for user to switch yes , to switch between channels or change between tracks on c_d_ , on chapters , on d_v_d_ player .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they're very vu vulnerable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's an idea , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and for other user interface had , it's more industrial thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "point at t_v_ , it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the t_v_ , so you must point everywhere , so infrared is , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should be restriction to that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not even pointed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "gentlemen , just reminder , we have five minutes left for this meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so when you're not able to point at the device the range is very limited .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you go to radio or .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for t_v_ , you're always in the neighbourhood of t_v_ , so don't think the range should be problem to that , but if you want to get it working with radio , and you're in outside your garden with just one speaker , then the range should be but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "two more things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you should able to feel the buttons without it mis you have to you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface for feeling should be good to understand .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al in dark too .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so when it's dark those are two really user interface .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll write down glow in the dark .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "want to hear ruud's input for this meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you yes , had , about three minutes ago , but i've seem to forget them forgot them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you have anything already ab idea about how the market will respond to the such product ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or what we should take in account when developing such product ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "most things have already been said , like control multiple devices .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , infrared might be an issue .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "he said about abo what he said about pointing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but lots of devices already use infrared .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we'll probably have to implement that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "sebastian , did you have any other ideas ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , remember .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you said something about visibility in the dark .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would it be for user to have display on this remote control , on which you can see functions ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which makes it easier to operate it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it can be quite simple , you can just have white buttons with black mark on it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the digits in black .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then it's already visible in dark .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it don't have to be lightning or fancy , it can be for design , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", because we wa we want to develop trendy product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , but there's cost limitation too .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , twelve euro fifty , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's more so that's big problem , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the financial part of this project implicates that it's not going to be high high-end product .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the cost price is very low .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just remind something .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the digits of the painting on the buttons should not fade .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have always have the soft buttons , always clear the paint on it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "very good point .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ha have one point which comes in mind now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the device should either be rechargeable very easily or it should not consume too much power .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every other week .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we could only light the buttons that are applicable at that moment or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but necessary , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's that's more sebastian's does it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then bluetooth might be problem .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause bluetooth , from the cell phone .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's use lot of ll , cell phones have integrated bluetooth also and , it's it seems to work quite .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so technically it will be possible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you can't use bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours day .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , you cannot .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "does it it's over ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "gentlemen , i'm afraid we do not have any more time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we will go back to our own work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "next meeting starts in thirty minutes and , your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this was it .", "speaker": "A"},
