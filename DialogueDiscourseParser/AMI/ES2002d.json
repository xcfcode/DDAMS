[{"edus": [{"text": "we all set ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is the final detailed design meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the end result of this meeting has to be decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , and then i'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so just from last time to recap , we said we were gonna have snowman shaped remote control with no display , no need for talk-back , it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery with rubber buttons , backlighting the buttons with some internal l_e_d_s to shine through the casing , hopefully jog-dial , and incorporating the slogan somewhere as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "anything i've missed ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if you want to present your prototype go ahead .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ninja homer , made in japan .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there are few changes we've made .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "look at the expense sheet , and it turned to be quite lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and inside , so instead we've this is gonna be an screen , just very basic one , very small with access to the menu through the scroll wheel and confirm button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "apart from that , it's just the same as we discussed last time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and there isn't it doesn't open up to the advanced functions ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they're hidden in the sense that they're not in use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "where are they ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they're in the panel and the jog-dial ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause the panel just displays functionally what you're doing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what thing is gonna be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you're using an advanced function , like brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say it's like it only has four columns , it's very simple like , whereas many the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it might even be one , bit more complex panel with pictures like the sun or the , the symbols of the various functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and what is this here ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's number pad .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the number pad is , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "where are we gonna have the slogan ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they're al along this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just like inside there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you have this space here , and then you have this thing on the side as , or at the bottom .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause slogans are usually quite small , they're not like huge so they're say button's about say button's about this size , so you would still have plenty of space for slogan , say even for that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if this isn't to scale , what dimensions are you thinking about here ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with finger so we reckon that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that would be about centimetre for button , so one two three four centimetres .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "plus half five six seven eight , about nine total .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "about nine in total .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "six , seven , eight , nine , ten .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we're talking about ten centimetres .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that sounds good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that would be good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so ten centimetres in height .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "nine , ten .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that'd be good , pen is about ten centimetres usually , so that would be that sounds like really good size , if you see it there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's and it's very bright as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it possible i'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is these are these the colours that of production , or is this just what we had available ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'m we're gonna have again the foggy yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but this button , because it's red it's very prominent , we're gonna use it as it can be the power button if you hold it for two seconds it'll send stand-by signal .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so just could you just list all the things that it does so write them in the report .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "apart from that it's gonna be used as confirm button for the screen and you use this as jog-dial .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's like an button , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we've discussed how high it is , but how wide is it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how high is it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no as in the height , but what about the width ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "didn't put five centimetres .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like depth of the actual thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do we need five ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't think five is be about three and half .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "something by there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is this to get an idea of scale from your thing there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can power on and off , what else can you do ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "three and half .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can skip straight to channel using these buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "were gonna have the volume control here , but because we've got the and the jog-dial we just thought we'd use that as the volume .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "jog-dial for volume .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and what else do you do with the jog-dial ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can use it for more advanced functions like contrast , colour and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "contrast , brightness , and anything else ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions , we didn't actually go through and specify the what can t_v_ do ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "of the designers what are they ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "things like brightness , contrast , tuning the channels .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's good one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the various inputs .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are you having v_c_r_ , are you having which input do you have ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "probably colour or sharpness .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "colour , sharpness .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "lot of these things will have to be free and open for users to define them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what about sound settings ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can you change any of those ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "audio , we have like your basic your base , your mid-range , your high range .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "left-right balance , even pre-programmed sound modes , like the user could determine like series of sound modes , and then what could happen would be when you click on that then it would go to that setting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is there anything else it can do ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that 'cause that's fine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just need to know so write it down .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's it , so we can now we can now have little look at the excel sheet and price listing , and see if we need to if we need to rethink anything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do we have kinetic as ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we need an .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's because of cost restraints is it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what about the electronics here ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we need an advanced chip , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let me just confirm that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the case , what does it mean by single and double , do ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "single would just be one oval whereas double is this thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we want double-curved ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is there any rubber in the buttons or any , and we wanted special colours didn't we ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're gonna have to skip the rubber .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'll have to put that no we ho how many colours have we got there ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for the case itself , one colour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's one special colour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just one colour , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause the case unit itself , the rest of our components go on top of it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so interface-wise , is it this third option we have , the two of them there ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one and the l_c_ display .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then buttons , we have what , two colours ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how many we've got push buttons as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have got some push buttons as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or even clear .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like so push button and integrated scroll wheel push .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so reckon we've got one button for this thing 'cause it's just one big sheet of rubber .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm not if that counts but you can see we're all very far beyond the could take out ones by making it single curved , just fill in those bits .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and special colour for the buttons , so four again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so why are we arriving at the number four ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "where does the number four come from ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause that's one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're writing down four .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we're just estimating that it would be less .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how about these ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "are we wanting them in no they're just is everything gonna be plastic ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we're quite far over .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now we're gonna something's gonna have to go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're at sixteen point eight and something has to go to the tune of two point three euro , so let me see , what are we yes , four point three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how are we going to achieve this high-end product if we only have very sparse two point three ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "four point three no ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "my maths is all out .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then where is the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how much would that save us ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how much would that save us ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that will only save you one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that is one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the other thing could be that you could take away the panel and the advanced chip together , because when you do something on the t_v_ , the t_v_ responds and reacts as , so the user could be looking at the t_v_ and pushing his thing so we may not need to so when we scroll we need just some way to get the t_v_ to respond , which is technically doable thing so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's fair enough , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what's our reviewed suggestion ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "take away the l_c_ display ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the advanced chip goes away as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to be replaced with regular chip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what that means is that the twelve buttons that you see there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so we've got point three to get rid of .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we ha where are the four push buttons are where exactly now ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's one piece of rubber but it's gonna have twelve button things underneath so reckon that probably counts as special form for the buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "functionally you're gonna have to intercept so four is good estimate for , so you can't actually cut it's like three times the number of buttons , four , eight , twelve .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you think ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like is that one big button or is it twelve buttons , how can it be something in between ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there's actually one button underneath , it's just that the panel itself is single panel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have point three to get rid of somewhere .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we just report that it has to be over budget , or the colours , you could take away colours for the buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no can do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could just go with .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "normal coloured buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you want colour differentiation here ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no that's not the button we're talking about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's the buttons only refer to the pad so should we take that off ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's back to the original .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so then these just become normal coloured buttons , so that might be some way of cutting the cost .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ach that's shame .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so take away that completely ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and now we're under budget .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we do have point five euro to play with if we wanted .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "doesn't say so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how about with embossing the logo , isn't that going to cost us some money ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's good idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "does that mean that one button has special form or .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's just one button so handy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ll there we go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so i'm just gonna have to redraw this now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we're not gonna have the anymore , and we'll just gonna have an on the t_v_ it'll show you what you're doing , which is fair enough , and so this is gonna be one big thing here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was the goal in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what do you mean by profile ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "flat as possible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you see envision it as being quite deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's what was thinking , to , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we didn't have enough play-doh to make it three d_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "al fair enough .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just thought i'd ask .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so there's one more dimension to the thing which we need to add , and you might want to add in the report , length , width , and height .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so just to be thorough then , width-wise we're looking at about what three centimetres ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then so height-wise how tall do you envisage it being ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "about that big ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it works , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "about two centimetres , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "two's not very high though .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is about this is about two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "slightly more than two , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see , about that thick .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "closer to three even or two and half .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ach , that is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we'll say two point five .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we have it within cost anyway .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so project evaluation is this point .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so can we close that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is what it's the final spec that it's gonna be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "someone is gonna have to that's fine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's probably just if it's worth getting into , but just in that we want this to be stylish , should we think little bit more out of the box in terms of button grid , because i've seen there's lots of devices out there that instead of taking your standard nine square grid , and they have it stylized or in different concept that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's something that's very hard to catch , so you restrict the number of people who wanna try something .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the look and the colour is something which is , but that there's also that factor of if it's too unfamiliar then because when you put it on the shelf button shape might be good idea to change , rather than positioning , 'cause positioning is we're kinda engrained into the telephone pad .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what about button shape ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so at this point we , let me see , discuss how satisfied we all are with these four points , with the room for creativity in the project , and leadership and teamwork , and the we had around us .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let me see wasn't really what that was , go for that first .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you want me to do you want me to do my design evaluation last ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should do the design evaluation first .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wasn't entirely what who was supposed to be doing that , but you go for it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "alright so the way this works , i'm gonna need to plug into powerpoint , i'll try and do it as quick as possible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is i'll just go over your head if that's .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't think you need the power , so no , that's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't need the powerpoint ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , the power cord itself .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "course , that's true .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so then you have bit more freedom to you still have your blue fingers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let me get that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what this is set-up for us to use like the idea is that i've set up i've reviewed all of the points of discussion from the beginning , and used that as criteria of evaluation for the current design or the plan , and so we can review that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you killed monster .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's gonna end up being elementary because we're sort we're in we're not gonna probably use it to change anything but doesn't seem like it's going , does it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there it is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and i'm gonna write up our results on the board , so this'll be way for us to go through and decide if we're review where we stand with it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so to bring together two things , design goals and also the market research that we had , when we rate this , one is high in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so these are the and we've been asked to collectively rate this , so what we can do is try and just work on consensus system so we just come to an agreement .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the first one , stylish look and feel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "rate that pretty highly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "compared to most remote controls you see that's pretty good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "me my only reservation with it was that we went with yellow because it's the company's colour , and if yellow's gonna really be hit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what does anybody else think ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but what do you think ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm seeing five then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would say five or six .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm fine with that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's go with five then .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "fi just actually the opposite .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's one to seven , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the so it meant three , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes then , then would say two or three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what's the scale , one to seven , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one's high-ish isn't it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one is high .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , two or three .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's go with two point five then .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "control high tech innovation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "has the wee jog-dial but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we had to remove , so we've had to remove few of our features we wanted , but jog-dial 's good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'd go with three or four , three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "say it's more medium , but going towards little bit higher than medium thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "about three , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "style reflects fruit inspired colour , design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "shouldn't have said colour , but just sorta .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's but the yellow , it could be lemon yellow colour , couldn't it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the blue colours and don't re don't actually represent the colour , except for the red button , they because for want of , the yellow is more representative of the colour , but the button itself , the blue can be anything else .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we'll go two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and design is simple to use , simple in features .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's really basic looking isn't it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "fairly basic , you think ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'd give that nearly one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "soft and spongy , have we achieved that ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite bit of compromise for price .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's about five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's really low .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have to use plastic so it's probably gonna be i'd probably increase the cost .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's could we have used an entirely rubber frame to it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was that an option ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it'll be cost prohibitive , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've only got like what , ten cents left so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it would cost more than plastic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "logo , we've got it in there , haven't we ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "gonna have that on the side , aren't we , like there ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it's within budget , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it is , isn't it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we can say then that out of possible or what would be our goal here ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "out of forty nine , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "out of forty nine with zero being the highest .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we are at two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'s pretty good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's pretty good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause if you turn that into hundred it would be about thirty one , and then invert that , it's , about seventy , seventy percent .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "twice that , about thirty one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so ab about sixty nine , seventy percent .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's pretty good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that was just little formality for us to go through .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "hundred pound pen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "nobody saw it , honestly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the cameras did .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that you all have all finished , or .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "did have one other frame , not knowing how we would deal with this information , in theory this process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's not something need to push through , but should we thinking more about the dimensions , like more of three dimensional shapes as opposed to just that flat could our design involve series of colours so that it's more of like line where we have like the , like the harvest line or the vibrant , the whatever just some theme and then we have different tones , lime green , lemon .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's just discussion .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can just abandon this , it's fine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm just thinking about what we originally set out to do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "are you submitting the evaluation criteria or am ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what your instructions have been .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to record it and haven't been asked to submit it yet .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just wondering if need to include it in the minutes , because if you're submitting it anyway then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it keeps getting too big .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "next up then , because we've done finance , is the project evaluation .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm listening i'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the thing , so i'm playing with the play-doh as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just in case you're wondering , why is he still playing with the play-doh ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just about l_e_g_o_ lego .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you wanna just individually say what you think about these four points and or not those four points , my four points , forgotten that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you got different , they're good aren't they , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's really quick .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "here we are .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as note we'll do this alphabetically .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you wanna start andrew ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what is it you're asking of me now ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just your opinion on those four points really and how we used them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or our work on setting this up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is it i'll just go through your system then .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the room is fairly institutional , but the main thing is , our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive and it would probably help to have cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion , as in other words this room is centre point of creativity , whereas in reality as we've gone through this , it's not really the centre point of creativity , it's more just debating , but that's just the thing is the quest in terms of the first point there , the room , it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we put out our ideas and then , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you feel though that you were able to have quite lot of creative input into the thing ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but don't means the room as in this room .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it means like .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", room for creativ looked up and saw whiteboard , digital pens , the room .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "dunno do you it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "on dif answering the question in those terms i'd say that actually there's tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this , but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of fashion trends , say fruit and vegetable colour scheme , but then we're told use the co company colours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what do we do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we're told terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and half pounds , so actually the creativity was more of like formality then an actual within the constraints the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you feel like you're caged within whatever it's like balloon in cage , it can only go so big and not hit the side .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the constraints do come in very fast .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do what , actually let's take each point and everybody discuss it , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so still on the topic of room for creativity next up is craig .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "agree with his point it's it is quite lot of fun to go and then you have hit the end then go , gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "another point is that the meetings are more brainstorming sessions than meetings , so time is also very strong factor , and structure .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because for brainstorming meeting you want structure thows you to allows ideas to get tossed , to be evaluated , and to be reviewed , and to get feedback and come back .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that point about the room not being very friendly to that , that's very big thing , and the fact that we're wearing these things restricts feel it 'cause wear my glasses , and that but that irritates me it does actually affect how , whether you feel comfortable to communicate .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "feel like i'm hiding behind the equipment , rather than the equipment is helping me , and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you think more relaxed atmosphere would be more conducive to creative thought or , but actual environment ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not so much an atmosphere , the atmosphere is very relaxed , but the gear that creates boundaries to that and the time given also restricts excuse me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what about leadership ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if that means like , if did good job .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't really know .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ll my sense on that is what guidance and direction , encouragement from and you as , just acting as team leader .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "from like your personal coach person and like that , do you think ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my personal views on leadership is that effective leadership gives people certain room for freedom and delegation , but then to come back with something that they take ownership and , innovative thought with .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in reality here the different elements of leadership such as the original briefing and then the personal coach and the and then having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite con confining framework to work within .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so it is leadership almost to the point of disempowering the team member , so but it's not bad leadership , it's just fairly strong , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it turns the individual into more of like predetermined mechanism , as opposed to free , without doubt .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you think little too controlling or .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "controlling is not the word , the interactions are very structured .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not co confining .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "structure is probably what you're saying that , each individual is structured to one particular task , and one parti rather than controlling .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't think there's sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of , like consensus , we go around and we think about it , but that process actually says you have to do it in certain way .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it doesn't tell you , some ways that you might wanna be bit more creative in terms of the process , not the you tried to use the common share folder to communicate , but it just comes back to us so slow in the email it doesn't have , messenger will go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what about teamwork ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "did , you wanna comment craig ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "reckon that was bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have quick talk with them , that would've been lot easier .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "did you get the email sent you ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not just yet .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "got the email .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was wondering if that got there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so to summarize the teamwork issue , saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting , just like quick questions , quick thoughts , whatever , it probably would be bit easier .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in it , exactly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration , that's the word .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they don't support the team working together , they're still very individual tools .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you , taking upon that idea , the way see this is that it's the structure in which we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the principle of teamwork because the tasks were divided , and then the work went on in isolation what you did while you were together , that was bit different , but actually if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said , first thing we have to do is come up with let's say design concept , and we sit here together and do it , that's what teamwork is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we had play-doh fun .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to say go off and don't talk to each other , it's actually predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not that we haven't done the best we could have done .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm not dissatisfied with it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "anything else to say on teamwork ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , not really .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what about the how we used the whiteboard , the digital pens , the projector , like that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "did anybody think anything was like really useful , anything was pretty un unsupportive ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the whiteboard , for me , is the thing would use all the time , but it's not quite as useful as to us as it could have been , just in the way that we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on board as opposed to in like in text .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then we could then keep our ideas building on that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "know that people who design cars and in aviation they quite often just have simple like fibreglass prototype and it's completely abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as context to walk around and puzzle and point and discuss and in way everybody's as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks , we're just we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and point at ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it wasn't until we had this here , like at one point peeked across and looked at craig's paper and i'm like , now he's thinking 'cause saw his book .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the whiteboard could've actually been this continuing think could be , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so do you think producing prototype earlier in the process woulda been good idea ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the focus of it lot was the powerpoint as opposed to the whiteboard , and that is also does hinder us and things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the powerpoint , or the whiteboard and the powerpoint in the same place , in the centre of the that there were too many powerpoints in the meetings .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because the powerpoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare , whereas imagine if i'd been encouraged to use paintbrush , or whatever , would've actually used it , 'ca , just 'cause that's sorta how we what we were set up to use while we had our time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause the plug-in and the plugging spent we spent lot of time doing that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and lot of the information on the powerpoints , don't think , we needed to actually it could have , we could have gone through it verbally , especially my slides , felt that they just as opposed to having to present them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , not quite .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what about the digital pens , did you find them easy enough to use ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they're bit clunky .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "having to tick it before you go off was bit hindering as , 'cause you're half way through thought , and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "know , at the very start of today like wrote whole load of , didn't click note on one , then went back and wrote one tiny wee thing on the another page , but then did click note , and so i'm quite worried that i've just written over the top of it , but they'll have my paper anyway and haven't done that since .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the pen is very intuitive , everybody knows how to use it , we don't have to worry .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the pen's good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's about the best thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it just occurred to me that they all we only actually needed one computer .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we only needed one computer and the computer may not be conducive to meeting because you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something , it's useful but too many computers are just distracting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if there had been fifth , that coulda just been sitting there ready to go the whole time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you think the computers just provide distraction in meeting ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like to have things written down in front of me actually , like lot of the that was emailed to me ended up like writing down there so could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that , about anybody else .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what else any wh do i'm not really what they're looking for when they say new ideas found .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is could you think of like anything else that would have been helpful today ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is this for the project or .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the main one for me is that the process na in natural context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , that's new idea for me is like just that idea , it's hard to keep working forward on team based project when you're told you must now work away from your team .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we just had .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on and like my experience with meetings is that they really do , and you can spend lot of time talking about the only thing is though like when we had our meeting about the conceptual design , there another fifteen minutes would have been useful there but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "really thi if we'd like all been working in the one room , and they just said like every hour everybody make yo just have short meeting and then just to have like something written down , just like milestone if you like rather than having meetings , but there you go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so in closing , haven't got my five minutes to go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "thin there it five minutes to go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "are the costs within the budget , yes they are .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and is the project evaluated , yes it is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so now celebrate .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it so now we .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we have ninja homer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now write the final report .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do we the other ones are ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what are you doing now ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that is lovely .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "said ninja homer .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what did you call it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "see it looks like homer simpson but it's electronic so it's made in japan .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so is that just is that just logo or does it do anything ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's just logo .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just logo and then like ninja homer , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the red is supposed to represent the whatever else you wanna print on the side of it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can wear homer , you can throw homer when you're frustrated , doh .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , that's , it's got i'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber , that would have been .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "from now on real reaction should give us more money .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "did learn something new , play-doh is useful .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no it is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it is useful and in conceptualizing , in being creative .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause like you say , it's something you can put your hands on and feel and touch and get sense for .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like we were playing with the play-doh and the ideas came with the play-doh rather than with everything else .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you might wanna write that down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's just , i'm just fiddling with the play-doh , and i'm going it's kinda .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , it's true , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'd forgot how good play-doh smells .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it smells funny doesn't it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and some play-dohs are actually edible aren't they ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like the for it has to be , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , all play-doh is edible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they're all non-toxic 'cause it's aimed for like two-year-olds .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's just wheat , it's the that your mom could make with preservatives and it's helpful to the creative process .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so to wha what are your summarising words about play-doh ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it engages all your senses not just your sight , but your sense of feel your sense of touch .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it helps you to understand dimension as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that that's very helpful because it starts to pop up , whereas on piece of paper , on computer , on board , even with three d_ graphic thing it still , it requires lot of tangible , that's word .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not very tangible .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it becomes tangible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if there's anything else we needed to discuss .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that that's about it really .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just sit still for little while .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could probably do it here as long as we don't collaborate .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm the little thing'll pop up any minute now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can we turn off the microphones ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if the
