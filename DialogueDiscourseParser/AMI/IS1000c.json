be the agenda for the meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "will take some minutes again .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we will have the presentations of you different team members , and then try to come to decisions about the concepts you have presented .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so and that will we have some forty minutes to complete this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so who has the fir do you ha anna do you have your presentation ready ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have presentation , i'm just making this i'll just email you this file , my presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the matthew it is it's important that matthew is here because it's really team project with team and if someone is not here then we cannot but it's good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there is matthew .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do presentation ready ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm just emailing it to you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so sent you the slides , you didn't see them ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so did you manage yes see him , good yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it should've gone through to you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes have it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is just presentation on the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can put this on ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we have to work out way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is to do this will not remove my microphone .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we used some focus group surveys which went through with you last time , the main results of that , and some research on the current design and fashion trends that are out there at the moment , and as part of this the important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the most important by far was the look and feel of it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it needs to stand out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "most people find remote controls boring at the moment , we need to have something that looks interesting , that looks exciting , that will stand out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "people will wanna buy it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that was twice as important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative has to have something else , apart from just the look of it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "people have to then think about it and say got something there that want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's really feature , and it has to make them wanna buy it again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "third on the list , innovative was twice as important as this last aspect , it has to be easy to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so they have to be able to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "drawing on the fashion trends at the moment , fruit and vegetables .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is talking about just the feel of it , so probably not the smell of it , but the bright colours , eye-catching , really bold designs , and spongy feel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "had talk to the design people about this , but having remote that's tactile , that feels different , that would be really .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would make it stand out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so can you repeat and be more precise about what you just said ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "about the feeling yo .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ma make it not necessar sp spongy is the current thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "spongy is the current texture , but there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile , so if we make it like furry or soft , that'll be something that sets it apart , rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so as far as the design goes , the very most important aspect was the design , to the customers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so going with the fruit and vegetable idea , we've got the bright colours , so makes it stand out , the oranges and the bright yellows and the florescent colours , part of the fruit and vegetables .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones , they've all got those lot of them have the changeable covers , so they can choose what colour the outside is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's one way of looking at it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "textured feel we just talked about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's another way of doing that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if it's part of the changeable covers then may they can choose different texture , spongy one or soft one like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so they can choose it li as they want to fit in with their decor in their living room , or just what they like , their sports team or whatever .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's very good idea , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so functionality , the way the mobile phones work , the way the keypad looks .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also just the way that lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they're big selling items .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "people put lot of thought into that so we can leverage off that , and we can start using some of their ideas .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "back to technological in innovation , not quite as important , but still big issue .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we talked about having way of finding remote control if it's been lost , that's one thing we could look at .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there are other aspects like screens and speech recognition which weren't don't think , in my personal opinion , gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're better doing something basic like this which is very important and very will be really feature to put in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "had no real specific ideas for this , we just , the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top , by themselves , and then the finer details of buttons you don't use as much either hidden away or completely separate .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes matthew can give some more information on the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that's the presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "good , that's very clear .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so does anyone have any comments or ideas on that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we yes can decide later on the look and feel of i've it was good idea to yes the there are changeable covers , but on the other hand whether my superiors would be so glad with it because you have to introduce complete new line of supplies it would be very complicated organisational .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to let the people choose , you mean ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'re selling so many units of this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is gonna be mass marketed product , we can afford to have two or three different designs at least .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "range of , set of three , four different aspects .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that fits the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes and it will be we get if it works we can get after-sales that would be very good those covers could go for three , five euro .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's very good idea and then we can go matthew's presentation because the together , because you ma might have some information on the easy to use , what you were already mentioning .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then we could discuss later like we can put all ideas together .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it should be easier with that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and your part is very related to mine because when you suggest something then it has to be integrated inside .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so i'll go with that actually so then the idea of having remote is generally you have different keys and different structures , different forms , and they could be like buttons or like and they could be of varying sizes if you want to emphasize particular key more than the other , and like you can have different colours having the red for the on off switching on and off the button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is the general trend to ha the method they do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what have found was that currently the they are mostly that the t_v_ , v_c_r_ , music system operated ones actually , and they are very specific to each other , but there are some common keys if you want to follow the v_c_r_ and if you want to follow the some soundtrack on the see they have the common thing actually you can have and there is also speech recognition to store channel information , names , like you can if you have multiple functionality , say t_v_ , v_c_r_ say it to the t_v_ and the t_v_ , and you can programme the keys if you want to , certain keys are even the channel information .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the name of channel like b_b_c_ , rather than having to remember the number of it on the keypad .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you can just because as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the exact channel numbers ex exactly , even if you arrange it by however you arrange it , you still have the problem to remember exactly which channel you want to so it it's like it limited one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "really like that idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what functionalities do you suggest for that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for facing this problem ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in the present market saw it that says something like they are looking for eighty word thing , eighty word , which shouldn't be that difficult to implement , like eighty to hundred word .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control , you want to st store your favourite channel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ten channels , at the most .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "some ten twelve channel information .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you don't want to st store all the hundred channel information into that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it depends like the remote with display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities you are watching movie , and you are having universal remote control and you want to you really which functionality is now , so am using the t_v_ so every time use it , it could be like , use simple toggle switch , and display , so press it so the display says , i'm in t_v_ or d_v_d_ or whatever it is , instead of having three keys separately for four keys , to model the functionalities will increase actually , and for you and you might want you don't want separate keys for all of them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote so that they are not allowed to browse certain channels which you can block them , and you can operate them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so these are the things presently which are seen in the market scenarios at present .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "personally would look at things like having universal remote , is good idea , like instead of having unusual ones for all of them you can think of having , with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "got mail from the coffee machine interface unit that they have integrated the speech recognition into the coffee machine , and so if you say hello coffee machine , it say hi joe , like that , and you won't be using it , so it's limited vocabulary thing , and very isolated word and it's it is interesting , and storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys , on the display for the browsing which is again and having something like blinking thing , like it could indicate you're it could indicate what is cal like the whether you have enough battery in your remote , the blinking .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but coffee machine , there's not too many words they'd be using with that it's small vocabulary .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "at the same time , if it's dark room , it can be used to locate the remote also or you can let them to do that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you want for coming back to one point you want to let the user to programming the keys ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "two thirty five supposed to finish .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "some of them ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and isn't that too difficult for the we want if we still want the r_c_ to be easy to use , that's the compromise .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no but the if you give it depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like would like to store in certain way , so if you want to give the full freedom to the user or you want to keep some constraints and let the user use it with that constraint .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can do it both ways .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it de so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can have it so it's easy they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it , or if they want to they have the option of using these extra features .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes but do you can give hand to us because i'm not whether that we can implement that for twelve euro and fifty cents .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm to have every time have to come down on this price again to so this might be little limiting for your creativity , but it's the real we have to consider it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so do we think these ideas an and my sp speech recognition , it's possible for twelve euro but then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the furry case of the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like would say that for programming keys , you said , it could be easily done within the package of twel twelve euros , but for the a_s_r_ system , i'm not if it's feasible to have this or we exactly if it's low vocabulary it's already implemented , and how much it's cost , with cheap chip .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can still look at we can talk with the coffee unit and you can check how much they .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can come we can talk to them , and we can come with that , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also you can think of having since you have something if you added little bit of display , you might need the to che keep checking the battery , so you really need some indicator , so it could be blinking option of l_e_d_ it could actually be used to detect also .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it's in dark room you can detect it also .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so no actually if it is like it tells you , it can be for two purposes , like if you have an display and all those things it's not going to be the standard remote , which is having which need just six volt three volts of d_c_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark , so either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them or if they light up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it may need more actually , so you may need to check your battery usage it and then you need that , some functionality to indicate the battery limit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then if the battery limit is indicated , if it could be ind indicated through blinking something and it can change the colour depending on your how much is the battery , that is good enough to even locate even if you want to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you have time some more ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how if have time to talk about the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes would yes you can still .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what i'm gonna present here is very basic knowledge about the all the components that are inside r_c_ remote control , and how is it manufactured what is the process , just to explain you .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the method is ther there is set of components in remote control like , and what cost the components in themself do not cost lot but the way to assemble everything costs , and will show you my preferences at the end .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so there are two different types of two different ways of using the components for making remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the basic way is to use an integrated circuit and some transistors with an that aims at communicating the message and to send the message to the led that will transmit to the receiver .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the other components and the circuit board buttons , infrared , led , etcetera , for the components .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you finding , just to say that the chip can detect when key is pressed , and then it translate to the key , to sequence , something like morse code , as , with different sequence for each key , and that's , with the components we will use , we will have different messages , different sequences , and the chips sends that signal to the transistor that amplify to make it stronger .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so electronic parts are assembled onto printed boards because it's easier to mass produce and assemble .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so for our design we want some programmable v_ v_l_s_i_ or f_p_g_a_ high technology , and this is important , and also we'll use like in any high-tech devices chip of fi fibreglass to them and connect them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so my personal design we need to find solution what is the material of the cover we want to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it's plastic or you said that you had some ideas like fruit , veg or .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ll we can give the case very normal case but , with the changeable covers to fancy it up .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so like normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in , wooden case .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just have just the veneer on it , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like they do in with cars .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "inside the car .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so they also emailed me that they have available bunch of different buttons , scroll wheels , integrated push buttons such as computer mouse .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and very cheap l_c_d_s , so liquid crystal displays , so i'm wondering , we might be able to integrate into our r_c_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the final point is we have there are some compromise to do .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we have to know that the push button requires simple chip , but the scroll wheel and that higher high-tech needs more money which is higher price range alright .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the display requires an advanced chip , which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip , but with twelve euros and if it's made for four million items , then we could be able to handle that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so to sum up we need so said that the components the list of components has to be listed and assembly is an important process that has to be taken into account .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and for the designing of the cove cover layout then it's better to see that with the u_r_ exp u_r_i_ expert so that we can it's really team-working .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so not design something without your agreement , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so wanted to know like if you want to have fo if you want to have the display over there , or if you want to store programmes with keys what things you'll need inside your thin inside wh what .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's simple pro progra programmable device , and we have to insert .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could insert one that could underlie several functions of exactly , for customizing and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so in that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is trying to use with the card .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "where they do all the wi with them actually .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we should come to some decisions now about this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so understand when we want display we need expensive chip , but when we want scrolling wheel we also need the expensive chip , so can we use same chip , so with one expensive chip we can implement several complicated or advanced features .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "exactly that's very good idea , we could have one main chip that could handle , it's called f_p_g_a_ chip , that could handle both like scrolling wheels as and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is possible in the given budget , we should go for the more expensive chip , so all features which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five euro .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you think that's feasible ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you t's possible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it possible to fit in to that ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also thinking , both if we had budget of twenty euros , it will be , but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we need specific costings then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually do two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's an excellent idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes wh when you make design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would be very good idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because now don't have price in head but for next meeting i'm be able to do that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's something which wanted to ask you also , like what will be the each individually the cost of it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you want to put wood wouldn't suggest for wood 'cause it's much easier to use plastic or rubber rather than wood .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "agree on that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it will be much ch much expensive though it's the most natural thing , but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes but we can just use more cheap plastic for basic edition , and then people can fancy it up with more expensive materials which come with another price .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's we can give preference to them , but it is but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is it's much better with that rather than going for .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you agree ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it's detailed plastic versus wood , and we need to centre our description on the really the what buttons what functionality we want to offer to the user , and with graphs or user interface designer you could help us on that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ma for next meeting we you two can present real design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so drawing it on the board .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then we now sh only have to decide the general function .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so let let's say next meeting you produce two designs , one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "furthermore we go for the basic plastic case which can be later fancied up with addit additional , how do you call them , these like mobile telephones you can put cover over it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that can be done later .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we now can concentrate on the basic remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can give them smooth keys , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "smooth keys with bigger so that the problem most of the time we've seen , the keys is that it's small , and every time we have to be very but if the if we go to different ways of designing those keys , then you can merge them together to you can actually , if you see , they are quite small over here , and now you can , as was if you make them big , it may change the look of the thing also to the people .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so is there any of these that you're looking at particularly or is this just ideas ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "at the same time , it is more like it would be more interesting for people who are having this r_s_i_ and all problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes bi big keys is good thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "big keys may better for them actually and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "agree , and not too many keys .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one i've had before , remote control we have at home is one that's actually got cover on the bottom so the bottom bit is just , covers half the keys most of the time , and then you can slide the cover back to get to the more advanced keys .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then you have still have when you don't use it you have such an extent of your remote control which you don't use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's possible , whether you can indicate this , that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are buttons you don't use that much .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i've seen that before too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "anoth another like it flips up and then you've got another layer of buttons underneath .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's something like this , the model here you can put the keys .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but i've seen also with keys and buttons on the top of here as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's what you mean ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes that's what so something like book .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like this one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like the shape of this one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can we have can we think about having non-recta non non-rectangular one , so with not just the straight little box that's curved .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like also this one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the point is we need to also to make decision on how big we want to be and how many buttons like we should dec decide numbers or .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we should make that next meeting we should be that would depend upon us actually .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is this for the next meeting though ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we might be out of time out of time for this meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ju just make two designs , and the we can decide between those designs .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would be good idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so anyone any questions for now ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so is this is there anything else need to do from marketing point of view for the next meeting ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes come to that yes , whether that's possible , you can start evaluating their work somehow .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it would be interesting if you could look for the cost inventories of other devices , if you're using speech recognition like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this me designing way to evaluate it so thinking about how to set up test groups and things ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "whether that's possible in the given time but as far as possible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you two will be together working on two prototypes and further instructions will be sent to you by email .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "two or three prototypes ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one for like cost and the one with like higher-end so that then we can be easily comparing them or find compromise between both of them , that's how it is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and find compromise .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's call this to an end .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we are done for now .", "speaker": "C"}], "id": "xxxxx", "relations": [{"y": 1, "x": 0, "type":
