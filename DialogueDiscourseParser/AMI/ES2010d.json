prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we're going to evaluate the product and the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , let's have the prototype presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you or me ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you read that , since you wrote it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for , i'm just gonna translate what this all means for you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll be the vanna .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , and it's gonna be plastic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then there's the latex cover , which is what you see as red .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because it can be replaceable , we just kinda went with the colour .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then the buttons are actually poking through rather than on top .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the buttons will be much lighter blue , almost see-through .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's just very pale blue and light-up yellow .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it just that one button will light up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then at the bottom we have our logo .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "bright yellow design with the r_r_ which will actually look like our logo .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then on the side you have the buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they're one button , but they push up and down .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't think they're scrolling .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they're just buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then , the buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on off switch will be here and as you've noticed on our prototype they've ended up with curvature , by concave thing , except for , can't see underneath .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so i'm hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that , because they're very to stock , stick your finger in .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the two squared buttons are two probably least used , menu , mute , and then these are the numbers , so our channel and our volume will be on either side .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then the last thing is just that it'll be black labelling on top , just which we didn't do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and did you determine the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand , is it gonna be single or double ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'd say single .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "single sounds good , 'cause it's not big enough to really constitute double .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's only actually the size of my hand .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you did an awesome job .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it is beautiful , and it's everything that we discussed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "good job , you .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "those are really good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright what's next in our agenda ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're gonna discuss the evaluation criteria , and that's with courtney .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's powerpoint presentation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't really know exactly what we should talk about .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's under evaluation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so these are the criteria we're gonna ask , is it easy to use , is it fashionable , we should write these down so we can reference them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "feel good meaning what ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like does it feel good , like , physically .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's just for current trend .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it doesn't really count , you .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it was little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it's so we do have removable covers , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then that's covered .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so we everybody have that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "she's got it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , we're using the criteria for seven point scale , and so we need to discuss how we feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it falls within this range , so for easy to use , do we feel it's very easy to use ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are we going to indi say we individually rate what do you say ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "true or false , easy to use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "easy to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'd say two as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "hello , we're .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's what say .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "at the moment , no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like no , it's very fashionable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "me too , very chic .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "thi would give it one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one , give it one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll give it two , because at the moment it's not looking that way .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's just like that's clay , it's prototype .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and ma it's prototype , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what do you think ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't t's that fashionable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'd give it like three or four .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , the average is about two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then i'm not fashionable , so don't use my opinion .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "two or three .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "two point five .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "neither are all the customers we have , either .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "does it feel good ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "imagine , since we don't have that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "feel like it feels good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "does it feel good ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the shape of it actually does .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it's it is very ergonomically designed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's gonna be curved .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's gonna be thicker .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll give it two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll give it one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what do you say ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'd say two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "alright , average is two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it technologically innovative ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm taking over your job here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , it's fine , you're project manager .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it does it have voice the phrase recognition on it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we were able to do it with that chip .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could do it with the chip , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it wasn't we have no reflection of it on the prototype , but that's because it's only two dimensions , really .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and there's no way you can represent it on here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we discussed that being included .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then yes , then would isn't what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don' have the , we can't say channel , and it changes the channel , channel eight .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it doesn't cover anything other then t_v_ , so i'd probably give it three .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "even though it is for just t_v_ remote it's very advanced .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it is just t_v_ remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'd go for three or four on that one , so , let's go for three point five .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "three and an half .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "alright , and the last criteria is it , we've covered that with the trendy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "squishy and fruity .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i'd give it two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's just trendy , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's capable of being squishy and fruity .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's very capable of being squishy and fruity .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it's very important .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so our re model slightly resembling giant delicious cookie appears to be winner , and hopefully we'll sell millions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "good job , team .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how did you get that in there ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the slightly resembling giant delicious cookie .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that was good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "alright , let's go back to this no , that's it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so now we're moving on to finance , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm gonna show you an excel spreadsheet and we're going to fill it in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under twelve fifty euro .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if so , we can proceed , if not , we need to go back to the drawing board little bit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so let me bring that up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here we go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not hand dynamo , it's powered by battery , so we give it number of components you plan to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do put quantity being one battery , or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if it's do you wanna go for this is where we need to make final call on if it's lithium or do we wanna go triple a_s , 'cause triple a_s we're gonna have do more than one battery .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's just go for lithium .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what do you say ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's do lithium .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the people who purchase this are gonna be technologically .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're gon that's gon nologically advanced , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "down to the electronics section .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're gonna need this kind , correct , if we do the voice sensor , so one of those .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it is single-curved , so one of those .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "down here , case material .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and special colour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and special colour .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "down here , interface type .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're gonna have the integrated scroll wheel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , we don't have the scroll .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "isn't those are just regular buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it's , but so but will we actually we'll need two , won't we ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's the push-button too , there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "integrated scroll-wheel or push-button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're really having just push-button interface .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we can just go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one for the top and then one for the one for each side .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it that just covers the type of button we're having .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because we're not doing scroll on the side , it's still push-button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like the twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and push-buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "she's what courtney's talking about is do we need to put two here ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we just have push .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we don't have any scrolls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like because there's like one interface here and then because it's not gonna be on the same plane when you press the button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there's gonna have to be additional signals on the sides .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so is that gonna be an extra one on each side ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they might put us , let's just .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "two interfaces , is that what should we say ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let's call it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "two or would it be three ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or three , because of one on each side and one on top .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's fine 'cause it comes out the same as twenty nine .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "less than twenty nine even .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we're gonna button supplements the buttons are no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they're special colour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they're special form , 'cause they're indented .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , they're special material .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're under cost then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , we're under .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "twelve point five is our limit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've got eleven point two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can go to production .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can go to what did .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now we're gonna talk about the project process and whether or not we're satisfied with the whole process and the result .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did we have lot of room for creativity ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did we have lot of room for individual leadership , teamwork , and the means , meaning the technology that we used to produce our little guy there , and if we found any new ideas .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now , question is , how do we do this ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we just discuss it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "who want who would like to go first ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself , in restricting us only to using t_v_ remote , initially .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we didn't have whiteboard .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and no internet .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , that's good point .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause i'd forgotten that wasn't our decision , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and how did you feel about the whole process though ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "overall we did good job like we got to choose we had control over minus it being just merely t_v_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we got say over what how technologically advanced it should be and also how fashionable , which like we .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we're fashion forward technology company .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what about the teamwork aspect ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how did you enjoy making the model , the prototype ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did you work together in there , and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , there was scratching and fighting , but no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "minus that one fight .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "my , and we've all been pretty congenial team here , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we hadn't had any ma fallings out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "minus you being wha what is it , the survey , annoying or what is it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's it's definitely strong one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the means , the whiteboard didn't work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and no internet .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have to knock that one down couple notches .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and no internet .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and our friend here really feels strongly about the internet .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the digital pens were they were pretty .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there's so much available .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like it's information .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "really appreciated those , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they were fine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they were fun , even though i'm not really what could do with them , but they are awesome .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the use of the laptops for receiving everything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it was wireless too , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "laptops are extremely handy , wireless .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and these things whoa .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that we have shared network where we can put all of the big brother .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and let's not forget the sexy dual microphones everyone gets to wear .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and big brother .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have we found any new ideas through this process ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we are really gonna sell this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that looks and also has what want it to do technologically .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's your brain taking over , wanting the artistic , the fashionable , the hip , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we all just went out and bought useful things , don't think that's not what technology .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's why don't like macs or apples , just 'cause look at it , and t's probably very good computer , but look at it , and i'm taken back to elementary school , 'cause they look the same .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they look like they did when was in elementary school , and that's so old-fashioned to me .",

, so associate them with like really low-tech , really cheap , bad .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just the mac font bothers me even .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but do like ipods , go figure .",
