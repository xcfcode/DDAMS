of rubber , very simple and easy to use , double curved , but also something that was gonna jump out at people , something that would be different , separate it from the other remotes out on the market .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what thing we have going here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , if you hold it like that , the one on

you , but it's just easy enough to go through it with you , so we're going for the kinetic power .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the electronics , we decided on it being just simple , the easiest thing that's inside it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the case , we've gone for the double curved .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it's made out of rubber .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the interface is push-buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and button supplements they're in diff special colours , aren't they ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so special colours .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's better for and special material .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "special form , they're special form there in shapes and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", these ones on the side are curved

you're .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "gonna do what you were gonna do , your evaluation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is where we all get to write on the , on the board .", "speaker": "D"},

doesn't fit the criteria .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the criterias are , and i'll draw this up on the board so we have box .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and this is false , this is just like to keep you informed .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the first criteria .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you all get what we're doing ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "first criteria , look and feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as it is it colour-wise and is it spongy ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what mark should we give for that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would give it seven .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as in it's not .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so i'll just write criteria one we get one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "second criteria , new technology .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have we implemented new technology ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as in the new high-tech so it's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the kinetic thing , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that was our main technological innovation every everything else was fairly simple , but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we'll give it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's ergonomic , but that's not that's design that's des that's design thing , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that's not technological thing , that's another thing , that's another marketing thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so on the technical side of it easy to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'd say it's about twoish ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's about in the mid in the middle somewhere , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so criteria three is it easy to use ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's one , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'd say it's wouldn't not if you're left-handed it's not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would give it would give it two , 'cause it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people , but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "two , so it's but if we make right-handed and left-handed then ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then would give it one , but otherwise two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "give it two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "criteria four is costs .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's come in under budget .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's definite one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "amount of buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like the amount of buttons , 'cause people like lot le like so it's one ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "contains only the necessary buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "r_s_i_ is it good against ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's anti-r_s_i_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and criteria seven , which is the last one , does it get lost ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is it easy to get lost ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't t's gonna get lost easily .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it is very bright , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it is smallish .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between couch cushion , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it would , could be , could get lost .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you could lost .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's not fully it's not fully like you can't say , it's not one , definitely .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it no , you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically , but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's bigger than the average mobile , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , it can get lost .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the mobiles get lost all the time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", two is fine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then you ring and you find them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , that's that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's the evaluation , so i'd say yay .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright it's all systems go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's like number one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we've , we've done .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "number one product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "all done , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can't fail .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we fitted all the criterias .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's that one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "done , reissa .", "speaker": "A"},

could be this quick .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this isn't simulation , this is actually so it's like sony or someone like that they're just , they get .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they're actually trying to find ideas for ideal remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they're using our ideas .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "two years' time this will be on the market .", "speaker": "A"},

questionnaire to fill in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so at this stage , is this the last meeting of the project ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we don't have another one after it's gone to marke

that's other departments it's another team that actually work out the mai the , the all the in the profit sharing , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we have vested interest prof profit sharing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we've made we've designed the product , we've ma we've got the prototype , it's within budget , it's does everything that we wanted it to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we finished an hour earlier .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's new , it's something that isn't out there already .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually and one advantage of this is that after the ,

off .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that , it's marketable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes actually do give you repetitive strain injury , our one does the complete opposite , so that's something that's new , which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something new .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it make watching t_v_ healthy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and
