[{"edus": [{"text": "everybody found his place again ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is our second meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and still failing ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now we're going into the functional design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "important thing of this phase is that we're going to try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that we can move onto the second phase .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but first this phase .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first an announcement .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's little adaptation in the air conditioning system .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so there's our ghost mouse again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that means that you can have little trouble with , little trouble with the air conditioning , that's because of this it's in wing c_ and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it should be over in while , couple of days .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it's going to be cold anyway , so don't think you're gonna need it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then our agenda .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now first the opening .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this time will take the minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you're going to have presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "all of you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we've got forty minutes for the whole prese for the whole presentations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , and then we can have little discussion about the new project requirements which have been sent to me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then the decision on the control functions which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we've got forty minutes for all of it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so suggest let's start with the first presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "who wants to be first ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'ll go first .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so just it's easier if you will tell your presentation as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just which function you have and what you're gonna talk about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my name is freek van ponnen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm the market expert .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you already knew that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i've done some research .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have been doing research in usability lab where we observed users operating remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we let them fill out questionnaire .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we had one hundred of these test subjects .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in addition we did some market research .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "see what the market consists of .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what ages are involved .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these are three quite astonishing results , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "remotes are being considered ugly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "seventy five percent of the people questioned indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on fancy-looking remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so in addition remotes were not very functional .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so some things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then we did some research to the most relevant functions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "channel selection and volume selection both got ten on scale of one to ten for relevancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the power button got nine .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and teletext got six and half .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so these are the most important functions on remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then there are some one-time use function .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's what like to call them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one hundred and sixty eight times per hour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then these are the this is the market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty six .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they like to use new functions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but they also are very critical .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they won't spend their money very easily .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the users of forty six to sixty five years cons the make up forty percent of the market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they are not really very interested in features .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but they do tend to spend their money lot easier .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what this indicates for our design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we should make remote for the future .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and this means we would have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this would mean we would have to make fancy design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused r_s_ r_s_i_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is certainly something to take into account .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn how to operate new control , remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so these are two factors that should be included in the design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "besides that the remote must look very .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the functionality as lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons , we should make very few buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this will also be beneficial to the design of the remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "especially the channel selection and audio selection buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause they're used most and so they should be robust .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they shouldn't break down easily .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then as mo as lot of people indicated that their remote got lost in the room , it might be and say might be because it would certainly boost the production costs lot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it might be good idea to make docking station .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and this would , could get button in it which would send signal to the remote which would then beep .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you'd know where it is in the room .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and in addition to this it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then surprisingly deal of people indicated that an screen in the remote control would be preferred .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this was mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but up till forty five it remains feasible .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this would also greatly increase the production costs but these are just some small factors we could consider .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that would be all .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so anybody have any questions until now ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "about functional requirements ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now to the second .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i've been looking at the user interface of it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for the techno functions of it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can take your time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've got plenty of time , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you should go to the top thingy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there it is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we must use the general functions of the remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i've do i've done little research on the internet and not much information about it , about interface but i've been thinking about simple manner to put lot of functions in one remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you've got lot of devi devices like d_v_d_ television , stereo .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so but it must be user-friendly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can't put lot of functions in one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in one remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "got many functions in one remote control , but you can see , this is quite simple remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "few buttons but this re remote control got lot of buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "people don't like it , so what was thinking about was keep the general functions like they are .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so like the on-off button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "keep it like red button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "everybody knows it so you don't have to change that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my personal preferences .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "use display for specific functions of the different device .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so wh what was thinking about was you've got this the remote control and you got here the general functions , like the on-off button sound and here you've got display .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you got general the functions of the device for d_v_d_ player or so the pl for playing reverse .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you got here real buttons for selecting device .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this button is for d_v_d_ or so for every device you've got part display of part buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you never got all the buttons on one device .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's my idea about it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and let's see .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the buttons the real buttons we have to use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we better use quite large buttons for .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "everybody have to use it so ol even old people young people .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we must keep buttons quite simple and quite large .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that was my part of it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "anybody has questions about the technical functions ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we are gonna use touchscreen we're gonna go way above the twelve and half euros .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you got quite cheap touchscreen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's not in colour .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's just one colo .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "seen something on the internet not today but few weeks ago .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you got quite an touchscreen and it's for twenty euros or less .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's possible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would certainly make fancy design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the it wouldn't be very robust .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that is true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's very fragile and you can get scratches on it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we would have to look into that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can first listen to your presentation ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we have little discussion about the requirements and design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's going to it's not too much .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i've got presentation about the working design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "first about how it works .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's really simple .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "everybody knows how remote works .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the user presses button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send signal to the t_v_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the t_v_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we've got the plate .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it gots conductive disks for every button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when the user presses button , signal got sent , goes to the led and transmits tranmi transmits its to the t_v_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's very simple device , technically speaking .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is schematic overview .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you've got the buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the power source .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and when button gets pressed , its goes to the chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the chip controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps normal bulb .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when you press button you can actually see your pressed button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should use default materials , simple plastics .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "keep the inner workings simple , so it's robust .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you only have to design remote once , and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's , in my idea , it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in the product itself .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now hope everybody has little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm the project manager so i'm here to mess things up and tell you some new requirements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's , we've got to design remote which is only suitable for t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it for more functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it has to be simple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of upcoming internet we think teletext is going to be thing of the past .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it's function we don't need in our remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "internet is also mentioned in function we can use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also on televisions it will be available as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "another one is the customer is forty plus .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's the market we have to target , because we are going to develop new product which is specially designed for the younger customers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is bit pity for the marketing expert .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because he was aiming on the younger persons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we have to find market which is above forty plus but which will suit our remote control , and the other way round .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we have to be very attent in putting the corporate image in our product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we have to be very clear on this point as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so suggest let's have discussion on the control functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can see if we can find way between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "against the no teletext ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature and it's not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and new t_v_s will have internet access on them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but if you're targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have t_v_ with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm against it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's it is standard remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "besides that , the market for forty plus is like pretty small .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but if see this , it's we're just gonna go for another pretty and not innovative remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no we can do lot with the design and the simple buttons which were also mentioned .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we put lot of effort in those , we can make remote control with just two or three buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or just remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty percent of the market .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if you look in holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it's the biggest share of the whole population now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes but it's not the biggest part of the market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and besides that , they're not very critical so they don't really care what the remote control is like .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they'll just take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but don't you think that if we make remote which is typically made for this market , that people think the people think that's the device i've looked for although didn't realise it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so let's try it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would be the case in the sixteen to forty five age category .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because they are critical and they want to have fancy remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "people of forty plus , they want it to work , but as soo as soon as it works it's with them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that if we're if we put our marketing we can sell this just like if you've heard about it in the news , the elderly mobile phone ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so haven't heard of it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's big success .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we make remote control just with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "very big success .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we don't have to focus on the design then but on functionality .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we just change our focus on the project , and we can sell this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "simply think that the new products we are gonna make , spef specifically design , are designed for younger people , so we can focus ourself on the elderly people .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we have to see what requirements we need for those remote controls .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause what you told is the channel selection is important .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "volume selection , power and teletext .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no we haven't voted yet , so teletext can be function as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the board tends to disagree .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but only if it won't higher the cost , because if it will be lot more money to implement teletext as , but don't will be problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or is teletext .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but deaf people need teletext for subtitles .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it'd definitely be bad idea not to include teletext .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is anybody really against teletext ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just that , that we just keep the teletext .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's good idea as , especially for the subtitles .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can make that another point of advantage in our remote control , if we make button ex for big subtitles , which is instantly on the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for elderly people they can think , wanna have subtitles , and they push the button and they get the big subtitles .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's good idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so teletext can be very useful in our advantage .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "functionality should be few buttons , you said .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's very important we have few buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so to keep it simple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but don't think that's really an issue any more 'cause might be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it's only for televi .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it , if it's only for t_v_ you're not gonna need lot of buttons anyway .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you need one to zero button , next channel , previous channel , volume up , volume down , and some teletext buttons but if you only nah .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but do you need but do you need the buttons for one to zero .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can skip the display , so we don't need it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can use no , we can implement the scroll button ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you're gonna include teletext you do .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "many people like to use that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you don't wanna push the next channel button thirty five times .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or joystick like ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there are other ways too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just look if you look at telephones .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the sony telephone has scroll button which is very useful in searching names or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's true but don't think there are many t_v_s that can switch channels that fast .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so you would need like the t_v_ would need an function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if many channels would do have that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if many t_v_s have that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and besides that it's if we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they're not used to using scroll buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so perhaps we should stick to the basic layout .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they can see how much buttons there are going to be on the display , and if it's too much we can reconsider it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but there won't be very much buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or there don't have to be lot .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but don't think if you're gonna make remote control only to operate t_v_ , you there's not much you can gain on having as few buttons as possible .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate t_v_ , which already only have the minimum number of buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't think there's much to be gained in that area .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the number of buttons ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's very important in the design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can make very fancy design with putting the buttons on the places .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if you have less buttons you can do lot more with to operate only the t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that is true but there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you're making remote control only for to operate only the t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause if you have remote control only to operate t_v_ there's simply not lot of buttons required .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there's not lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply don't have lot of buttons either .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we can .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would cost big marketing expedition which was one of the arguments to make it only for the t_v_ because we didn't have the time to market lot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you suggest we could better focus on the docking station .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like other functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "instead of less buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "mean we need good way to position all the buttons and but don't think we should spend very much time in that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you think the docking station will is allowed in the budget we have ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it should be possible yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause it can be no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if it's not too fancy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because that's good advantage point as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we have fancy-looking docking station or very that's requirement .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're just gonna focus on the extras ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in like to have extra in new remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's good point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you said they easily get lost as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we should implement the audio sign , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that was what suggested .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like with your key-chain , if you whistle it goes it makes sound .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have it on you have it's on some phones too , which have docking station .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and you just press button and the phone goes ringing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so audio signal should be possible as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so where it is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's not too expensive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "another point is the screen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if that will rise the cost too much , because .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen , 'cause it's don't think they have different television sets in every country .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it will be too much as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "since lot of people indicated that new remote control is hard to learn , and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have hard time understanding new devices , it might be good idea to have just little screen on it , which would explain button if you press it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which would tell you what it does .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or very expensive screen , but just small screen with two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just the normal screen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so some extra info .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's good idea as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if that would fit into the costs .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as the small screen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "extra button info .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that should be possible as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's see what did we say .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "few buttons , we talked about that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "docking station , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and default materials .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's good idea as , because elderly people don't mind if it's titanium cover or just plastic one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that doesn't really matter .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we nee let's specify the target group .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "probably elderly people would be little bit more careful with their remote controls than youngsters
