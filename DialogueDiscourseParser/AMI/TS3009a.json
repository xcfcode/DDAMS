want to sell it at twenty five euros internationally so but we dunno what exactly it is in dollars , but twenty five euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our profit aim is , worldwide , fifty million euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so didn't exactly calculate how much we have to sell .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we want to keep it our costs at twelve and half euros so , keep that in mind when we talk about our materials an and , and marketing research .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now then we all we can sit down and discuss what do we think about our current remote controls , first about design about aim in the market etcetera ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can sit down because presentation can .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can take notes and who has some remarks about the current remote controls ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "didn't have to prepare anything about it's not , it's not my task to talk about experience with current remote controls , but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just we're four if we would just have one then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's im it's important to look at the remote controls of our competitors .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "get the good points try to merge them into one universal remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "on our corporate site saw new d_v_d_ player we're gonna produce .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's important to make it compatible with the d_v_d_ player so you can use your television and your d_v_d_ player with the same remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that would be idea , yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "furthermore it's important to make it acceptable for the whole world , for different cultures , because we want to we want to fifty million ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes fifty million is our aim to profit , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so lot of people have to be able to use it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no but the buttons have to have international recognisable buttons and numbers and that every culture in , people in every country can recognise .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "easy to learn .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll make notes and then 'll put it in the project folder when i'm done just now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also think we should not add too many buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "modern day remotes have too much buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you don't use the half of them that's culture international .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could make one button to switch between d_v_d_ player and t_v_ and make the other buttons multi-functional .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it doesn't become too complicated with too much buttons and stereo audio installations .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we do we even have more than just d_v_d_ player .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't we have other ou .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use , we make ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we also just released t_f_t_ thing saw .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so but that's kind standard t_ television so it also works on that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the people who will buy our remote already have some experience with remotes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we can keep that in mind .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "most people do , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it doesn't have to be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it doesn't have to be , but we can .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "t's it's new remote and you don't buy remote if you don't have anything to control with it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "except if we deliver it together with our d_v_d_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we need to keep it consistent with other but it's it has to be useable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because we look at competitors and if we pick up the good things about that and give it design yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it has to be different and familiar at the same time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we could use another form or shape or colour , that things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the shape will have to be recognised .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "about like most remote controls are long box shaped thing you can make it triangle shaped , but that's not very recognisable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we could make more oval , and or so it's new .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "oo we can use it as game pad .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so one hand has the beer , so the other hand we already one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so there has been done lot of researches about remotes we have to we can imagine because it's long time on the market .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not with two hands .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no but it's quite important that it fits .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but young people want something different and it is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it ha it has to be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you still have to t's remote and not another .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the form will have been tested out so yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the long box shaped thing must be , useful or else they would have been ano another shape .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for me personally have lot of remotes at home but those ones that have round ending and just an square middle don't like to use them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have to it has to fit my hands .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when it falls over it and have and then the button that use most has to be here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it shouldn't be boxy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "lo the long box shape .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have to use one hand .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with thumb .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "nah don't agree with the long box shape it has to be custom made for the hand .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it doesn't fit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "tho those new d_v_d_ players on the market do have those .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this , and you can make it another shape , but then you have no what else ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if you shape it if no that's ol old fashioned .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no if you look at new phillips d_v_d_ with their remotes pl players they are the new remotes aren't box shaped .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "di but what do you suggest then ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "imagine that us .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes most of them are somewhat thicker at the end , and get thinner towards the other end .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it fits in your palms .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's still then the long box , but then with some round forms in it to fit your hand , but it's still al alright but it's still box , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it has that's tha shape that it fits your hand .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's we have five minutes left .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it has round forms but it in the end it's still the box , so that's what .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it has to fit your hand .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "understand , but no don't mean an entire box like completely square but also with round edges , but in at the end it's still this long box shape with convenient round shapes to fit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it shouldn't be too boxy , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it should be something like this or and then button here to switch between different systems like d_v_d_ player and so you can i've , and do think we have to keep this idea with the numbers and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes about something like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "big recognisable button on top .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so yes that's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the buttons should also be not too small , not too big , and not too close together .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it should be possible to make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so there has to be some space between the buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to have icons to explain the different functions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we should use colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can just like on cell phones those you can put on them , and so you can customise your own remote with different colours or special paint jobs but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's kinda trendy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have to talk also about the materials for .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "t's just about our first ideas now so individually we'll have to come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it's important to notate all the decisions that we make , so we .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "already thought about something tha .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "thirty minutes we have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is about what we are going to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so it's logical .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's all .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we'll just get notice that the meeting is over .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now we can still talk about the material , we have some minutes left wrote down that the case should be plastic , hard plastic , the buttons should be rubbery .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it shouldn't be too heavy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have had remotes that they had the function of the buttons was about layer over the buttons and when i've had use it much it was gone .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's bad , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it has to be made in the buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it has to not be loose .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and there are several electrical cables in it to connect things to each other .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is there an universal way of transmitting from the remote to the television so it's all about it's not that in china it's different ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's common stan standard way infrared beams an infrared beam .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you can have different between d_v_d_s and televisions and between .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you can use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it it's we make an universal remote so it ha has to work with all kinds of brands and things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but our t_v_s are mostly made in china and that country , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and have i've wrote something down about how it works .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the user presses button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly , but that's pretty obvious , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but are we going with the front fronts idea ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can look into that in the next thirty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we should make it universal and you can always use front on it , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can use it just plain but you can to make it more trendy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just you get normal front with it , but you can change them when you buy the and we should dispatch those fronts around the world so those fifty million don't se sells itself so we have to make some extra effort like fronts .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can make profit with them , and it's way to make them trendy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the standard front will be just grey simple colour not very flashy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "has to it has to fit the te television and d_v_d_ set we are going to sell , so if they are black and silver we'll make them black and silver so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no colour everyone accepts .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "pink television sets pink remote , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but people of often don't like bright colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have to make it grey or black .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "young people li , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but then you can use front .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "must not forget my pen the next time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you have television room for little children and you make if you buy pink front they'll love it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or teletubby front .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that's marketing research you can ask .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our user interface you can what your specific instructions will be , but probably about the precision of the buttons and those things and what buttons will have to be on the remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you will look into the technical design and form , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also the look and feel of the remote's also my task , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what's the url or the website 'cause didn't get .",
