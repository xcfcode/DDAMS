[{"edus": [{"text": "time is it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "fourteen twenty six .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "lovely to see you all again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "these are our minutes from the functional design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different functions of it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our main objectives were simplicity and fashion .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , possibility for extra functions , like sliding piece and long-life battery or charging station .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now three presentations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would be me .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "function eight it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm very excited by this one actually had lot of fun doing it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is where you look at what does it take to make remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , we need to examine each element separately , but we're designing full thing , so you wanna keep it integrated as whole .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the main elements of remote controls in general , and therefore ours as , are the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "these are all things that we had addressed before , but i'm gonna take each one little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the case , the options that i've gotten from headquarters about what we can do , there's the shape of case , we could do flat sh flat case , curved case or even double double-curved case .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet , just keep that in mind , but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic , the main base will be plastic , but we have all these fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would be our case .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "buttons , for buttons we have pushbuttons , which is what real reaction uses the most often , but we also have scror scroll wheels , which can have integrated pushbuttons , or we could go all high-tech and have an l_ screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "circuit board and chip we can have simple one , regular one or an advanced one , depending on what our other needs are .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then battery is where things get most exciting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're talking about long-life batteries here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can have your basic double batteries , but we also have these options of using kinetic battery , like are used in high-tech watches , where you just have to move it little bit to get it to power up .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or solar battery , although there are slight complications with solar batteries as in we can't use latex case if we have solar battery .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago , flashlights .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not quite what that is , but that's the description that received , so that's what i'm passing on to you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so those are our options .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "personal preferences that was thinking through here's what we've been talking about all through , fashion and simplicity .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if we're going for fashion in our cases , that what we're gonna wanna look at is curved or double-curved case , probably with variety of design elements .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "titanium , some wood .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're gonna have to investigate that better when get specifics of the actual materials , but that's what have in mind .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we wanna go for simplicity .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "probably pushbuttons , but i'm intrigued by the idea of scroll wheel , if anyone has anything any ideas on that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "know the ipods and things now have touch scroll buttons which are exactly like what they're describing , so that might be something we wanna look into .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and i'm really intrigued by the idea of kinetic battery .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "solar don't think would be such good idea , because how often are you that your remote control will get certain amount of light .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but this idea of the kinetic , that you don't have to replace , and that simple just shaking it around will make it work , that would be very interesting thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we'd also wanna go for simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we really only need regular or advanced chip if we're gonna start using an .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we want to be aware of not making things overly technological if they don't need to be , 'cause that'll keep our manufacturing price way down .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's what have for options .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'd appreciate anyone's input , but that's what i'm seeing for the future of the look of this thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is double-curved like would be like two hands thing ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "haven't received any specific visuals of this yet .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause i'm imagining like double-curved is like , like two sides that curve and then like one curve would just be like single vertical-ish looking thing , but i've no idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is what i'm .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm not , but i'll let as soon as get any pictures .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we do have double-curved case , it can't have any titanium in it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the titanium , they were quite they're marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space programme , so that could be quite interesting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just all things to keep in mind .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just an interesting marketing element .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's about all have to do , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "hope didn't go through that too quickly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just real quick question the weight of these different elements , have you no idea , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no idea , no idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm assuming that kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight , and that tita titanium is very light , know , but other than that's really basic , that's all have gotten so far .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "any other questions ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have save this in the shared projects , if anyone wants to look and have considerable notes on the topic as , if anyone needs any more information .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just in my notebook , but if anyone has any specific questions , don't hesitate to email me .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you made notes yourself you can put those on our underneath our , in your book , then don't worry about that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now we're concepts of user interface .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this one's so much tighter than the other one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here you are .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright , so i'm gonna describe the concept of the user interface of this des device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we've talked about the two essential properties of the user interface .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we want it to be simple and we want it to be fashionable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "other we've also got to remember that this is device that serves as useful purpose .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we want people to be able to use it as remote control , so we need to determine what the essential functions of the device are and make that we include that we've included all of those and that we actually end up with device that is going to be useful to people .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have number of different choices for design concept and that's something that i'll show you some examples of , but essentially we need to choose how is this device going to work , how what model is there going to be for user interaction with this device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "once we've chosen concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , making that we get all the essential functions in the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we also have to make it look .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , that's what we don't want .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we don't want lots of buttons , complicated features .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we want something that looks and simple .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "here's fairly simple device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is an ipod from apple .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's very minimalistic in its design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you use these four buttons to move around range of settings on the small screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the thing like about this is that it's very quick to access the main features .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can just about make out that the button three buttons are previous track , next track and play pause .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they're the main features of the ipod , the things you will use all the time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then if you want to do anything more advanced , you go into the little menu on the screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and find the more advanced features that you want .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's good model that we could have .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "here's another example .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is it's an interesting idea and it looks pretty .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's certainly got novelty value .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's and colourful , it's and bright .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's also something that you can feel your way around .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the buttons are different shapes and you can if you're watching t_v_ in the dark or whatever , you can work out which button's which and , it's ith it's fun .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you'd need few buttons to select your favourite channels .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "most people , when they watch t_v_ , they have two hundred and fifty channels on their t_v_ and they watch of 'bout four of them at the most .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , you have buttons for your favourite channel , changing the volume , which is something you do all the time when you're watching t_v_ , and the button to switch it off , in case you get bored .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "other features , things like adjusting the brightness , tuning the t_v_ , what else you do with t_v_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but these are all necessary functions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can't have there's no point having television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast , so we need to find way of including these somehow .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and one other suggestions i'd make is to in is to include in menu system , bit like on the ipod .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we'd either have small display on the device itself , or have dis menu display that comes up on your television and can be controlled through the device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that would allow you to access the advanced features whilst keeping very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you'd be advocating an then ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's one way to go , yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are advantages and disadvantages if you have an display , it's , because it's it lets you just sit there and st and control your television from your armchair .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are disadvantages , an display would have to be quite small , 'cause we're 're assume we're gonna be making quite small device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it would also have to have backlighting in it , 'cause you ten you tend to watch t_v_ in the dark , but you need to be able to see your l_d_d_ display .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the alternative is to have an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "bit like how they have these digital boxes where you press the buttons and it comes up with your this thing of watch lo what's on each channel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that that's also good idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's it can it does have it's problems as , if you've got small t_v_ and you're sitting on the other side of room , it's hard to read the little text that comes up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that's design decision that we can make .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do think that one of the important features for remote is seeing menu and seeing what's on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so like favourite channels is applicable , but that you do need to have some function where it's you have you can see the title of the show or possibly description of it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are you tak .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like use that often enough .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but is that separate from what he was saying ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it if it was l_ on the remote , that you could that you'd be able to see .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the v_c_r_ if i've understood you correctly , rather than menu as what's on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would be one of the features , yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it's something to bear in mind is that if we put display on the remote control the communication is one way , so you can't have the televisions and information back to the remote control , at least don't think you can .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause that would be more specifically digital box , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now we're moving on to market .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should plug that in ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is that going on ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's just not is it on ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that should be alright , actually .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ri what do you have to press , five ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "keep pressing lots of .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how relevant all of this gonna be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if anything , the that they gave me .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's not plugged in , quite in enough .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there we are .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we're gonna look little bit at trend watching .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was given an executive summary that was market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted , and then also some fashion watchers in paris and milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so first they had people they ranked the important aspects of remote controls , and now they're saying that currently there's functional look and feel preference , but that really , over the next year it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes , so that just goes back to the whole desire of our real reaction company wanting to focus on fashion and so , even though we're stressing , when we're talking , we've all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea , they're wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and as these are ranked , the top one is doubly important to the second one , which is doubly important to the third one , so just to take that weight into account .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that would be like if we use something like the space material or the screen , things like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then ease of use was the third most important , whi so really , no matter what , we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel , according to this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how much we agree with that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes , shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there's preference for spongy , tight material .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so that brings us to my personal preferences .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "who wants spongy remote or one with fruit and vegetable padding .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "personally , don't really think that want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale , excuse the pun , in year , so even though this is coming from us as , trend watch , market research , how much of it we necessarily wanna take away .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "also , considering that the research has been carried out by real reaction , i'm little hesitant as to like , how these questions may have been worded , and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology edas ease of use is necessarily the ranking .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "personally , like might reverse it , but if we're working for this company then no matter what , we have to stress fashion the most .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it doesn't necessarily need to be spongy material .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that there's all kinds of scope for imagination in that one though .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't have lot of notes to share if you want them , that sums it up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do we have any some questions for this , let's see .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what can possibly enlighten on ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how to use fruit or vegetable or the spongy material ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like could we make like could we make spongy remote ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it would be easier on the hands .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if it's latex if it's latexy , mean an if my understanding of latex case is that it's hard to protect inside , but that it's covered with the latex , which is spongier and softer on your hands .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's and then it we would have to find way to protect like the chip and all that , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's there's something to be said , we got that thing earlier from you about not wanting it to repetitive stress injuries and things and , something grippable , we don't wanna go spongy , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so something , instead of necess , grip , i'm thinking grip more than like sinking into your hands , and i'm envisioning more like , the material that you have when you sit on like bicycle , so that it doesn't hurt when you're sitting down for long time , like i'm imagining that thing , what that material's called .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that given the list of materials was forwarded it's that seems doable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could colour-co-ordinate them , li the buttons could be fruit-shaped .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for , or like couple main ones being like , lemons or strawberries .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "could they be smelly ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it supposed to be shaped like vegetable ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "t's quite easy to shape thing like carrot isn't it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like , like carrots .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or carrot shaped , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or like potato .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or the buttons could be shaped like different fruits .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like large button , that's what was thinking of , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what about the idea of like round remote ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "instead of like vertical up and down one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like in terms of holding it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like that's shape of fruit .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it'd be harder to bu buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just to tie it in little .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "might would you think you do you think you'd be able to hold it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause the reason they're long is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it'd be harder to press button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "harder to push .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when you use remote , do you press the buttons with your thumb , usually ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or your fingers ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's ts how tend to do it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "usually hold it in one hand .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then the buttons would have to be very small .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or you want something that's shaped like mobile phone , so you hold it in one hand , and you press the buttons with your thumb .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause otherwise your fingers can't move around .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't you think ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no just thumb-sized .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but like love the idea of the wheel like the ipod .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but in order to get to all of them , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they would have to be within certain amount of space with each other .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if you've only got like four or five buttons anyway , then it's not so much problem , perhaps .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when i'm pressing buttons on my ipod , that's how do it , hold it and press the four .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you hold it in one hand and you press the buttons with your thumb and you find that works quite ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or in and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it wel , it would each version of it has been little bit different , but , you had one of the in-between ones , when they weren't doing that anymore .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that the button on an ipod , is it what is it , is it just four buttons or is it li more like scroll thing ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause it's like five , 'cause there's one in the middle .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's scroll , it's wheel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the one have doesn't have the four on like around it , don't think .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ts and you press the centre button , that's your all-purpose select button there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "since it's the one in the centre that's not marked , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's quite good design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like just the idea of like those so few buttons for main things , but then how you could go back to the menu and like , if we would want it on the screen there or on the actual t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "am wanting to say on the t_v_ , 'cause if you're changing the brightness , don't you wanna see it happening , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then you could still have that available .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "an screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it could be difficult in practice , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also , 'cause you would be looking down at the screen , than back up at your t_v_ and people don't wanna do that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we probably have to get going , don't we ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have we've about fifteen minutes left , so i'm gonna continue with my pres presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i've one more slide before we close , but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things , so i'll just bring that up and show you all before we move on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then like the covers could be spongy latex wherea but the actual model could be titanium .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if get any more information of fruits and vegetables , i'll let .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like , to make it different fruits .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in different fruit and vegetable colours , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you could co-ordinate with your house or whatever .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the packaging , it should be like lemon and the packaging is like the peel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "all these options .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so instead of opening the box you just peel it , and the remote control's inside .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the ipod packaging is me like was so that was like half the fun .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's like the way it all comes all cute .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "energy , chip on print .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "uh-hu , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "had skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get be necessary but alright , so decisions , what the deci decisions on energy i'm thinking is based on the battery .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's this is the agenda they gave me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so can you just explain what that is real quick ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", it would take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's good , as long as we consider the cost and the how reliable it is , but as far as know , the technology is good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "haven't gotten any , any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than regular battery , but if we're using an cheaper chip , then it'll even out , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but over time , it's but if you could scroll through the channels , and then the volume would just be and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as i'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker looking .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "got whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they're thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them , and di they're quite easily printed on by machine , which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't really to tell you as far as decisions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wasn't really given any options , was just given that this is how they're done .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'t can't really tell you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "tell you whole lot about how it works .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but any decisions on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if they're really options .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm , did .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "al all circuit boards are the same , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's fairly standard .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then we'll move on to the case .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "bu if we decided on like simple , regular , or an advanced chip , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here's the thing on the chips that got .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "simple , regular , advanced chip on print .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the chip on print includes an

chip , and an requires advanced .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do we want scroll wheel , or do we just want pushbuttons ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it might be for changing the volume .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it would be for changing the volume , but how useful it'd be for changing the channel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but don't would really work .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause you don't have control over numbers or we have five minutes left for the meeting , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you really need buttons for changing channel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it'd be handy for going through if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices , than you can scroll down on the scroll .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and otherwise , no matter how may buttons we have , we're gonna have like , black with red sticking out and no it's gonna inevitably start looking like those group of ugly ones that we saw stacked up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , have scroll for volume ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or for all those secret functions ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "when you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have scroll wheel to go through those menus .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "scroll wheel would be , but it's not necessary .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we could either go with simple or regular chip , depending and we could table that decision for later .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "when we go on to the une userface , we're gonna have to decide the interface we're gonna have to decide whether we're gonna have scroll or not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's think about that while we talk about the case .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let's do case .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if spongy is the in thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm little hesitant about it , because i'm worried about protecting the on the inside .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would be more with like titanium actual thing and then like mobile phone thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "could it be hard , and then something around it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "everything i've wha what i've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that there's like hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not too thick layer of latex , just enough to be grippable , like bike handles or anything that you've seen like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the inside is hard .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board , that that's done for us .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we do want latex .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and probably in colours , fruity , vegetable colours .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's go to the ufe user interface then we'll come back to the chip suppose .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we want curved case , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we don't really the difference is , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm thinking curved of some sort .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we don't really the difference good point .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "interface , the type and the supplements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so push or scroll , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , 'cause then we can have simple chip and it's simpler , it's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is scroll button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so in terms of in terms of economics it's probably better to have pushbuttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if we had sc an on-screen thing that you could scroll through , like you can use your buttons to scroll through things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", it's fairly simple .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for channel surfing scroll an actual like an ipod's scroll thing would be too fast , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information but have no idea how much more expensive scroll wheel is than pushbutton , but it's gotta be some more expensive , so it might be better to put our money into the like the kinetic battery and the case because .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that with you ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how you feeling ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and let's like see if we get anything else .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel , it's more just to give it different look , but if it's gonna be in latex type thing and that's gonna look , then that's probably gonna have bigger impact than the scroll wheel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it might be enough .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're gonna go with type pushbuttons , and then supplements , how are we gonna do that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what do you mean by supplements , exactly ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "assume that's what else we're gonna like ha the additional buttons we can use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're gonna have like menu button , so that we can access on-screen things then ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what are our buttons gonna be ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "on off so like one through five , or no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "on off , volume , favourite channels , and menu .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "about like , bit like radio presets .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like radio type sorta situation ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we wouldn't even need the numbers .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "pre-set channels and then we're gonna need numbers one through zero , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "numbers seems is old-fashioned .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but in order to pre-set cha you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're scrolling through .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", you can just and you need some , up down button , but the volume control could double for that , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "finishing the meeting now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our next meeting starts in thirty minutes , you
