"but now where it is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what is this ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and import this until one more .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on the desktop .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what the fuck is this ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "nah , nah .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's the empty one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and presentation of working design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here it is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "little later but here it is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so now have ten minutes to tell it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's little difficult what i'm gonna tell you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's about the working of the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "had an half an hour to study it and don't get it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ten minutes to tell it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it will be few minutes and first will tell you something about the findings , what discovered about the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the working bout it of it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then i'll have some map , and it's the top of the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "with little bit of science , you will show that in few minutes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then what i'll think about it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "first , the findings .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the remote control is very difficult thing to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen remote control inside .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's lot of plastic on it , because its not so expensive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and there are lot of wires , which connect the components in it , the battery , and there are switches and things like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's lot of small electronics .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it won't be too expensive to build it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "only twelve euro fifty we will make it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now and here have the top of the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "here's some chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on top of this , there are the numbers .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have all on your remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the teletext button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and here's the battery .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and when you push the button , it will be sent to the chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the chip will send it to all sub-components .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's what said , it's very difficult .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and after that it will be sent to the infrared .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that will send it to your television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's short how it works .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "make it difficult , but we all don't get it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's it won't be we shouldn't make it too big .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also for the cost , we should only put one battery on it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also for the cost , use only plastic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not other materials .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also because of the cost , not too much buttons on it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can also make button with menu button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then that you will see it on the t_v_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and on the t_v_ you can switch into the menu .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's it's easier .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the bleep signal , you told us .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we can also use it bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is bleep .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then you'll have to change it in week .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also the bleep , when what told you about when you lost it , and you push button , and then you hear bleep , and we will find it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is just .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you say one battery is cheaper .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we use only just one small pen-light , then it will be cheaper than when we use two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but when you use two , you can use it two times longer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then we'll have to make the remote control long lasting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's the size of the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when you use it on the television , you've you need the television , wh which can use it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but this our remote control is for the televisions we sell in our company ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or is it also for other company for other televisions ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have to use it also on other televisions though .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then this is an option .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so but don't it they are two different things though .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just menu button to use it on our televisions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then we make it easier for our televisions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and on the other tele televisions , you can also use it , but then we won't use the ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have to choose one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it has to work on all televisions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then the menu button will only work on the newer televisions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we will look forward and don't make remote control which for the older televisions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and have one more idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's one of your tasks .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , to have trendy remote control , we can also make something like the nokia mobile phones .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to change covers .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if you have trendy half with all red , yellow and something .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then you can put red cover on it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also different things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "will this add to the cost ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then it won't be will have just one cover on the original one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then you can buy the covers .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes but you have to be able to change it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "does it make it more difficult to design ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it will be little more difficult , but not too much .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just like with the nokia mobile phones .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but there are much more nokia telephones than these ones .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then we'll have to just put five covers on it , and see if it works .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it won't works then we'll get something else .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then we won't go further with it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but are their profits bigger than their cost ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "cover made in china , it won't be so expensive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but there are also design cost .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't think when you have remote control , do you change the cover ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would you change the cover ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but trendy people or like children where you can paint on it , and the children think , this is my remote control , made picture on it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that too less people would change it for good profit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so yes it is but don't think we have to do it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the other people ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what do you think about it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's good idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if it , don't i'm not if it will make profit enough to but it's original idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you're the project manager .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so now the user interface designer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes shall give short talk about the technical function design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the technical function design was to for remote control to have some influence on the t_v_ set .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "both audio and vide video in cordless way .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no cords attached .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , it all by pushing button on the remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that was from my own experience and the previous meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "find some interesting quotes on the web .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the same idea here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "message to the television .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and basic operations like on and off , and switching channels , and teletext like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "these are two remotes , and that's our dilemma .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we just heard from the industrial designer how difficult it is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but shall we make basic remote control , just swapping channels and volume and power button and nothing much more .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or more functions on the remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "more devices you can influence .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "radio or video recorder , v_c_r_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's our dilemma .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "any ideas about that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "basic or multifunctional ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we'll got back on that later .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the that was just on my mind .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so didn't what way we would go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that was my functional talk .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then it's your turn , the marketing expert .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this bit too far .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so i'm gonna have presentation about the market , about what people think .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we did usability lab-test with hundred persons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we looked at several things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "among them design , how did they like the use of it , what frustrations they had while using remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what will be our market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we asked them if we had some new featu features .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if that would be good idea or not .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they especially found them very ugly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and they also found them hard to learn how to use it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they also zap lot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so zapping should be very easy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so lot of unused buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there is more findings .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "on the buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which buttons find users very important and which not ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and how much would they use them ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the most used button is the channel selection .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we asked them how relevant they think the buttons are .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the power , volume and channel selections are very relevant .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "teletext is less relevant but also important .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not important they found the audio , that's not the volume but specific the pitch , or the left or .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the screen and the brightness .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and channel settings .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and they also are not used very often .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then we have few graphs about the market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "here we can see what the market share is of several groups .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as you can see , most users are between thirty six and forty five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and to come back on the swapping things , don't think , the younger will be most interest in it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but they are not very big group .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in the we asked them , how would you like new feature .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you have an on the remote control , what would you think of it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now you can clearly see young users say .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "will that would very .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and older user think they will be scared of change .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and they won't like it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and another thing , how would you like to have speech recognition on it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "here we see the same .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "young users think that's an interesting idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and old users not .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "found out that there are two several markets at which we can aim .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the first are the younger , the age between sixteen and forty five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they are highly interested in the features , as you can see here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and they are more critical on their money spending .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the second group is the older group .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "aged between forty six and sixty five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they are less interested in new features .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but they spend their money more easily .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about sixty percent .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the second group about forty percent .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the first group is bigger .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then come to my personal preferences .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the first question is also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but less of them will buy it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what , even young people say it's hard to use , remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if you make remote control that is very easy to use , that's especially aimed at this group , even the young group will also be more interested .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we can make special features .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it looks in the first time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but when use it , what's good thing of speech recognition .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's my second point .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "less important functions should be discarded from the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's about discussion we had earlier .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can find most functions on t_v_ set .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you don't have to have lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and such things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the design is very important .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one thing did not say , is that lot of users also said then would buy good looking remote control if there will be one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but they found most remote controls very ugly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the design of our remote control is very important .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it should be very zap friendly , as most users use it for that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that were my findings .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have one question .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we aim for the younger people , and there will be lot of features like or the speech recognising , the cost will be lot of lot higher .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we don't have that in our budget .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you think ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and don't think twenty five euros for remote is really cheap .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's , it's hard to get the younger group .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the is cheaper than speech recognition .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that can be an good option .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so but we'll come back on that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now , go on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what we go back on the decisions later .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now we have few new product requirements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first , teletext .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so not necessary .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "only for the television .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we don't look at the other things like the radio .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "only the television .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we look at the age group of forty plus .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , younger than forty .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is big group , and like you showed , not very much people buy our .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our corporate colour and slogan must be used .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "very important for the design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you can see it on our site .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to make our decisions , what we want to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so like you said , we need the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's good to put it in document .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now we have to decide what controls do we need .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you can tell us .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can first have discussion on the product requirements you just said .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the requirements you just said , we should first have discussion about that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , it's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "personally think teletext is good option .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not everyone who is looking t_v_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we don't use it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's new requirement .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , it's not my requirement .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll just have to do that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have to do this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no discussion about it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what controls do we need ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the separate channels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so but then both the separate channels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so zero to nine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "channel zero to nine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's easy to pick .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what was your one ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's the functional requirements .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we had no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "where was that example of the johan .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that was the technical hallo .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what do we need ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "zero to nine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to change to the next channel , just one button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to move up , move down .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the channel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do we make menu ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes the newer televisions ha do have menus .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it will be quite easy to use , to have four arrows .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the only one or two numbers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's ch yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "up-down for channel selection , and left-right for volume .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and menu button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the then to scroll through the menu and to change the options .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "on the screen , you mean ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that depends on if you have the menu on the t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or you get the menu on the screen on the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "t's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it has to work on all televisions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we need yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then we come to the costs .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if we have this so now we don't have lot of buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you aim at the younger market , as they as we seen in the usability lab , they will buy looking remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and also to find the easy to use part very important .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if we have sh screen , and not too many buttons , that will incre even when it's bit more cost , it will still sell .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is this enough ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in the menu ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then it's always more than one thing to do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then that's all .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this will be the buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's enough for the next phase .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can go on to yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but now we have only the buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we don't yet have to decide what
