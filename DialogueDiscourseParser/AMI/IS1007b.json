[{"edus": [{"text": "so we come again for the second meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for the aim of this meeting now is to make presentation about the work for each one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and take the decision about the design and the functionality of the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we have got new project requirement .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so teletext becomes outdated .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet , and we don't need lighting adaptive , so the remote control should be only used for the television .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we should have our image in the design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , let's start with the industrial designer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so have powerpoint pr presentation stored in my personal folder so you can reach it from here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or you can use the whiteboard if you want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just go to explorer .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you want to open .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because it's open you mean .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so will talk about the working design and will present my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "slide show , view slide show , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so can you go one page down , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve what we want to do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i'm thin i'll do survey about what is available on the market and what is the cheapest possible things we hav we can use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then will try with the technical team to build prototype and to see with how this little box would look like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and how an and we can start troubleshooting first com communication problems or things like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and when we are ready with this first prototype we can add some software functionalities on programmable chip like browsing by content or things like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so can you go down so , wha what for now is we don't want to have remote control which is wired so we can use battery for the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the communication with the t_v_ set is made through infrared communication so this is the schema of the future remote controls so you can see the components , battery and the two chips goes to the infrared connection to the t_v_ set .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "did you draw it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what is the other chip for ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the one on top .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the one on top is for the functionali the functionalities and the red the green one is to , putting things together , transform the data into qu into the format to communicate with the t_v_ set .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one is communication .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to the in .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , that's it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should use f_p_g_a_ for the functionalities which is easy to it's field programmable something array .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what is f_p_g_a_ ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's field programmable gateway arrays .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so why's it how is it different from the bluetooth ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "f_p_g_a_ is just chip you can pr programme it wi with wh whatever you want .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the bluetooth chip is just responsible to make the communication between the two devices .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this are the they have to work together ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do they have to work together or two separate choice .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the f_p_g_a_ will produce the data to send .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or it's something like isn't hardware the first one ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the second one is for the software .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is the software par alri .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to run to make it run .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you can control if you want , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "alright and that's it for the working design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if you have any questions ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and how about the battery power ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , we have to have embedded batteries in the into the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "into the more compact and , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and don't will need very much power to make it run , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can put it on the charger when you don't need to use it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's good idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "having charger rather than putting the battery cells always .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "people don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we just make small charger and put it bu our remote , we do not want to make it p_d_a_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because you are using because you are using bluetooth , if some people have p_d_a_ they can use their p_d_a_ to control the t_v_ if they want to , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's good idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ma we can change the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also , but the goal is to sell our remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so charger for is the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so is mine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "participant one , no ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have so let's move to user interface design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you can open three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "participant during the weekend .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'm working on the technical functions design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can you show the next slide .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the purpose is to find the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so found on webs on the internet .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "spent lot of time searching and found that the function of remote control is to send messages to television set .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not the t_v_s .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so found two very good prototypes for this interface from our competitors so can you , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this are usual functionality .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ours is bit different .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so these are two example .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one is from the other one is from , engineering centr .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is the most competing prototypes i've found .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but then loo but then found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and they are small .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "on the tried to play with the problem is that if have hundred channels have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and have to compose the number so it's very lousy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you move to the next one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so talk about the problem .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then look at the user manual they are hundred pages thick , so we don't want that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so propose the easy to use prototype .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can navigate on t_v_ screen and we can the user's preference and we need to have the t_v_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the t_v_ programmes by x_m_l_ and we need some to do some preprocessing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "from the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the t_v_ set than on the remote controller , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then we the speech recognition as harry says we may just put in we may k_i_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what do you mean by the pa processing will be done on the t_v_ than the so we should have specific t_v_ ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "all the processing is done the t_v_ is compu has some processing power the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we have to we have to sell t_v_ with the remote control too .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can use this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we don't , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because are you just wondering what controller .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there is al there is technology like show view who is already available on most of the t_v_ set on recorders or thing like that and we can try to get this information on to the remote control to do the processing on the remote control because yes , that's good idea , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the processing on the remote controller so it can be used in any t_v_ , any conventional t_v_ sets ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the next one ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so come up with simple design , just keep the navigation buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "keep the navigation but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we don't need really much buttons to if we have screen to navigate on the t_v_ so , four five buttons , it's sufficient .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's easy to build , it does not consume much power .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you have catch there , assume that if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then you go to the main menu and you have go to channel and then you can .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , because you choose by channel , so you choose by t_v_ program so you don't have hundred channels to choose from .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you go by channel , you don't have to do that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if you want to make big jump but you have to have device when you could , not mouse but something that says more clearly that , left , up , down , the to have the ability to write something to the navigator , directly , or so , we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you are .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we'll see .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how the this remote ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's gonna be small .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it'll beep if you wanna find it you just shout just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how bu and responds to you , and i- .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just give it name and we call him .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so next presentation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface , most of the points which want to are already covered here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put feedback forms in all the magazines , and the users send the feedbacks , and based on that these are the findings which we got and adding of speech interface is always good for t_v_ remote but the technology we already know that as discussed earlier an it does how feasible it is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it will be , yes , bit complicated to make speech recognisers runs on the small ts .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if you to recognise numbers it's well-studied problem .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you just recognise numbers is limited you have limited vocabulary .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we just have the it's not going to take much space also .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and this can allow to choose the program , without adding buttons so it's good idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's going to be very slim .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and next one was the size of the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it has to be very slim and small one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive , so this is an important criteria here is we have to look for trade-off .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but do you think what they sug suggested possibility .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the features and the cost .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no that if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and comes with reasonable cost .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort , extra features .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "little bit more if it's with extra features .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "speech is important extra feature , we are we just have to find mean how to add microphone or yes microphone into the remote control , so will be alright .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but is it useful or not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there is in the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for lazy they could say nine and the nine channel comes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or they say movie name or don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , this should be good idea , to put this features .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the fourth one was the teletext in various languages .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as discussed in the earlier meeting , but not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it's necessary can you can do that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what is the teletext ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can integrate small microphone in the remote so it's not really problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what about lighting adaptive options ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "according to the re to the new requirements we don't need that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you need special t_v_ sets to do that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or it's done via this remote controller ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's very complex .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's for the industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's bit complex too for our next product , our new t_v_ set with automatical sound adjustment light .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as discussed that four points would be good for marketing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then we can conclude that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it's quite possible but not in this project .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we have still we have couple of minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so any things to discuss ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or any suggestions ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the speech interface and less reasonable cost .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the lighting adaptation and the teletext .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and regarding the teletext these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you are watching an foreign movie , you get subtitles sometimes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if you are french guy watching an english movie you would like to have it in french .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if am german then would like to have the my options in german .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that should be good point .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but what about the new project's requirement ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should give up with teletext , no ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can we is the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can already think about way to access the internet via the television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because if , but we can think that in few years there will be t_v_ set that can access the internet .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "using the t_v_ to access the internet ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "didn't quite understand , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's good idea if we think about how to build up our remote control with this functionality in which will come in few years .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we already have some .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if we already have it in our remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you have to anticipate the future ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the future demand , market demand .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to desi , not to implement it , but to , to find way to add this functionality in , in an easy manner , if is possible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the functionality in the future .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because all the t_v_ sets will be digital , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "all the programmes , everything will be in digital than analog .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so let's go for the lunch break , and we will meet after .", "speaker": "A"}], "id": "xxxxx",
