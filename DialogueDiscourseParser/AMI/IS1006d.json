[{"edus": [{"text": "so , hi christa .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , now it's the hi sammy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , first mark and rama are going to present the prototype .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then sammy will propose some crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then , we and then we going to do some finance to see if it is feasible and at the end we will evaluate ourself as team .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's all .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so first , let's see the prototype .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here we have our prototype model .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you have some slides then ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have also some slides .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , and place some slides .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so in which .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is our remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's working prototype .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can use it now by switching all these buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so first , present as we came to this perfect model , and then we'll give some technical specifications .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's , so that's that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we analysed all the fruits and contacted nasa , and made some real good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you can see this , and the stars are showing that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , society will accept that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and making some analysis of different fruits , we choose the ultimate form , ultimate colours , and ultimate smell of it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea , 'cause it's the most of the moder the modern material we can select .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it's practical .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it's still say it's for our needs , so press something .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and as said , it's perfect .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "explanat see this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "everyone is really glad to obtain an such device .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can touch it with your hands .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can spongy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what do you say ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you must say it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it says will i'll buy it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if need so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "hopefully my daughter will like it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we got the answer .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it is , yes , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is prototype .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can have look at it , and that's all wanted to say .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now it's technical specification by our colleague .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there is button missing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is really flexible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can add your buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's in option .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so function , so , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so , we have buttons and using , or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the , and then do on and off .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then you ha you'll have volume control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we have some controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like , switching the display if you want to use , or you don't want you can just use normal button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we have speech recognition .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "here you have microphone , and then it date records your voice , and then it try to recognise .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it can also do the action .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and location finder .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we want to do the location using speech recogniser .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can just say , where is my remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or , you can just give some nickname to your remote control , like bobby .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then , it will say hi .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "hi , and then you can use it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , our team is now fruits .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , you can have and then you can see the look and all the switches .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "these are strawberries .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "material , we want to stick to titanium .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we will send , we want to , or so , we want to have simple and perfect shapes , like shown in these phones .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "fruit smelling spongy titanium .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "didn't exist , but that's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can have your own designs and you can feel simple designs .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you mean we can change the colour of .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's for the or for the titanium ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with titanium it's it is silver .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "tit titanium is , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we are still working on titanium .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , we'll start with .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can ask bob .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you're theme today .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "even you can configure your colours for its the depending on your mood , or and you can have many colours on weekends .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "black for sunday .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , wh what are the strawberries for ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "these are like sensors .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what do you think ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's location sensors .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , after this meeting we'll propose party for our success for so , if you are vegetarian or you have any options , let us know .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we can just some strawberry first .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , any specific questions for .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we'll see in the financial part if all gets into who is the five fifty millions we first make party in ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it makes sense .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's make party first .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then we can discuss we can , then we can have how much for how money is left .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , this is what design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so let's , let's see if it's meet the evaluation criterium .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's my turn .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's see if this , if you meet the evaluation criterion .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , evaluation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you made very prototype , and , we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it , if it fulfils our what we want to do , and things like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , next slide , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as , before going and creating and producing these strawberry remote control , it's very important to first verify if it makes sense , if we have chance to sell it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we need to evaluate it , try to do it in constative way , and as much as we can .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to so what propose is that we are going to have this scale from one to seven .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one meaning that , ye yes it fulfils the criterion , whatever it is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and seven meaning , no it doesn't fulfil .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we're all going to list all the criterion .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm going to go to that next slide , and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then we are just going to have an average , which will give us the value of our remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , we can have look at the criteria ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so these are the criterion i'm were important .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this can be discussed , but let's see , so let's vote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we have fancy here and we have the scale from one to seven with four in the middle .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , what do you think , is it fancy ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what's is really , it's really .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that fancy , we can say it is fancy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it is very fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or have you ever seen something like that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "am not the only one choosing , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what do you think ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what do you think ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "feel the weight .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it the weight is later .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now we're on the fanciness now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's quite fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's , so no it's one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can give at least five or six , seven .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's in the other .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one means it's , yes , very fancy and seven mean no .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's one or two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what do you think ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's say two , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so here , two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then we have technology .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we have .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , what about technology ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have speech recognition , we have location based , we have .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you change colours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "change colour of , it's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "change colour , that's very quite it's one for that , at least .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "at least one , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "still we need to cha , it strawberry .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so let's suppose my daughter take it and through it away .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you makes sense that it's going to live again ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not the prototype .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we just lost one strawberry .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how can say this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can easily plug it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's still working , and your daughter got bonus .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's not so bad .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would say three .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that does make sense , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's robust , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the question is does it have the minimum requirement of re remote control ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these buttons are it not clear .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", lets me try .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you have at least next produce .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what is next , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is volume control and channel changes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it depends on the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these are the main you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you can do di two sites ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you can do on using these going to scrolling all the option .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so but , because the is not touch control , touch screen , you cannot go to channel twenty five directly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if you don't want , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can , by using the you push here the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you go you so , the basic mode .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's simple .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the basic mode is you got just two buttons and jog dial .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "with two buttons , you do this like volume up , volume down .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's jog dial , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or if you go to the site , it's channel up channel down .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if you want to make to twenty-five , you push on this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can select .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you select twenty , you select five .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's much longer than that being two five , no ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "may not , we can go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you need to like press two and five and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's it's less .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's , because people anyway don't go there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but so what do you think for it , usefulness ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , we need to address we want we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "seems to be useful .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let me understand , because i'm not that's for that this one are two dir directional button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "up down or left .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and which what is that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's jog dial for controlling the cursor on the screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is jog wheel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's kind , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like , selecting the menus .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "see in , like you will have blocks and you select which one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would say then two or three ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now it's looks us useful .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "two or three ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so size and weight .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is it the effective size and weight that the is it real size , real weight ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or because it size is going to be that , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's size al almost , because it is the weight will be bit lighter .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it's going to be lighter , because this seems to be very heavy , for my daughter , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we will we use titanium .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "without titanium alloy , it's going to be light .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not if she can use it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but sides , the sides should be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , should be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "up to three for that , because i'm haven't seen the weight so must not colour and shape .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so colour , it seems that we have the several colours for the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the case .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the case is silver titanium , no ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's going to be titanium .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and what about the strawberries on the top ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm not convince .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but i'm not trendy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , but they're not useful .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's this fruit and vegetable year .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , usefulness is as rem just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "whether it's fancy or not now , it we have to decide .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then it's bit difficult to use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but this if it's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would have found more fancy that the fruits are useful .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , that they will that the fruit may be here instead .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not like this we're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction , too .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , think we can have rubber or some sponges , for strawberries and different colours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's even these buttons but it looks really not really good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , it seems we are not so clear on the shape suggested three .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , i'm not why if it was like this it's no , it's not fancy any more .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so these are rubber things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "even if you lose one you can just put whatever .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and moreover , moreover it covers all the end goals .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "even we can provide many different colours or different fruits , and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and different routes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see what , so you feel like it's something protection for the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "even if it is , it's very rounded , but still you got some rubber fruit here , and it's completely secure to leave it with children and that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we've we have sensors here and so here and here , so we just , so even if you don't put , it works .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but this is really fancy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because , everybody doesn't seem to be convince , although it's quite you have good arguments .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but and the last one is adaptive .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is not as important as the other one , but can we adapt it to each personal use ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", just look at it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's full adaptable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's yea , it's fudge titanium .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can fit it into your palm , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can fit into your palm , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that what else can we need ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's fudge , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's two point one seven .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "fruit titanium , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if this is if you are ready to do that , then it deserves one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's go for one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now we have to do the average .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "three , six , eight , eleven .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "who is good in math ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "two point one seven .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "two point one seven out of seven .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have good thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's all had to say about the evaluation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it seems to be good , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's good evaluation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "two one seven , we have .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so financi energy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so now , it has to fulfil the financial criterium ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , have an here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so how many batteries do we need ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we use bat one battery .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we just need one , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , ne never install .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "two batteries or one ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , number is one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we need only one battery .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the price is two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but no , no .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , you just number .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "number , number .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , no way .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you never use excel ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , never .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how what what's the limit ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's that , 'cause it's not my field .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's twelve bucks .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "twelve and half , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we have sample chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "check that number also .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's simple chip ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like simple chip , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "simple chip , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "four buttons at least .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then we have the sample speaker sensor for speech recognition .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and for the one also .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one or two ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one to one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the case , which one is it in the end ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we will go for single curve , no ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let's do single curve .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's flat , and curved .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can curve somebody .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it is flat , you look .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's curvable , but it's not curved .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there is supplement for that , no ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's only curve ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "see , that the price is this one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this , you we tried , we tried .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't chip on me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , what is it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but she wanted the fudge titanium .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , only one , no ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's five , but you don't say .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's stick to titan .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "again , i'm see it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "special colour , or it's only on the , but there is no colour here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , in display .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so put it here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how many push-button ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "scro , two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "three or two ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is there the scroll-wheel , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's going to be expensive .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one scroll wheel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's not we choose this one , and not this one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", no it's , is it scroll wheel and pe push button , this centre one ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or only scroll-wheel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or only scroll wheel , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "only scroll wheel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's already .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you are trying to make up make us up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you try to no , no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because how do you do to select ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , but you select with the two the other two buttons , no ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you go on the location with your scroll wheel and then you stay longer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then it automatically we can just do like you feel , it goes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it will activate , plus , it's price is really special colours , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it should stay .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "buttons and strawberries .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , buttons just normal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have all of these , no ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "she's very hard on this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not this one but , so not special colours an interest in ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have titan .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's for buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but buttons are standard .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "buttons are the standard buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's only buttons , these .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we are at seventeen dot eight .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , the colour is in the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and buttons are not colourised ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they are boo-hoo .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", because you can just go for good colours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can just use this red .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's so what is are we supposed to cut things out now ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's already too expensive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "until we get twelve fifty .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so think of what we can cut here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if look at what is the most expensive things , it's the and the speaker .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have to choose one or the other .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as you may know there's some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng , producing electricity from mechanical energy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , the point is that when you take device and push the button , you produce enough energy to make electricity .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you don't need battery ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that you don't need battery .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , it's something like hand dynamo robot .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "real high-tech version of it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that would so , but if we select the hand dynamo it's , we only we win one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's like the hand dynamo , no ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the jog wheel can be like hand is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but why not .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's already that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's do that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's do that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so one here and here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and propose to so , about chips .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "advanced chip on print , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , put minus one there , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm not if this is legal .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "minus three , no ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , was there result ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's not changing , no ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let's have look .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it you don't
