[{"edus": [{"text": "welcome to the detailed design meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and looks like we've come up with some ideas .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we also talked about materials we'd use and what chip would be necessary .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so for later in the meeting i've done spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take look at that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and see if it's changed from when we last discussed it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so actually you wanna give prototype presentation of is that broccoli ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so our design looks something like this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this being the wheel that you use to change channels or volume or whatever .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it brings up the menu .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the base of the remote control , which has squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it comes , change the vegetable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you could change the vegetable , or fruit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this one's broccoli .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is mango .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you don't have orange , you have mango .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "strawberry's not as trendy , but so we'll come up with variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'s very bright strawberry .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's been little bit difficult to make that it's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , it's not too big .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch out .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we think that this , this size will be and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was or design yet actually , would be the thing the locator .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how so that's just so you have to have button on your you have to attach the button to the we have that has yes yet to be designed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the locator is just chip that's inside there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the beeper's also inside there too somewhere .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we didn't design that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it would be coordinating with that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that could match the handset .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you could have broccoli , or you could have mango .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an excel spreadsheet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the only one that's in there , production costs .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if you open it up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i've just stuck the numbers in , it was real challenge there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if missed anything that we've gone over , or if you see something that has changed , we decided on batteries , and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced ipod-like button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "said uncurved or flat .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's what you have there , is that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for the plastic part would be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my impression was that flat meant like one of those square remotes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it's really not very clear , because you got single curve and double curve and what that means .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one side is curved and then the other side is curved .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we're talking about the area just .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what else ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's plastic for that area around the button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then rubber would be the squishy like thing ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and lots of special colours actually .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you see anything that i've missed ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no that's alright .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that would make our total of eleven point nine , which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of profit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if we sold lot of squishy things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did what did you work on ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you wanna .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i've got presentation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's , the powerpoint one ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so need where's the cable ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what happens is we have to decide whether this whole project we've been working on actually meets the standards we were set at the start .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the method is we 've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the findings were that we need it to look in certain way , feel in certain way , and this is everything's listed down .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "look in certain way , feel in certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these are all things we looked at the start , and criteria that have to be met .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have to use table , i'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we have therefore in total we have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the cri the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would like to show you the table we have to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is the table .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can you see this here ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the que the questions i've given you could you write that down ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "true is one and false is seven .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we'll just go through each point together , hopefully .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how it works exactly , haven't been told .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is it possible that we can bring this up on our own is it meeting three minutes ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's in the it's in the project documents .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no it's not minutes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's called evaluation criteria .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it's under evaluation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you've found it all ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it was true's one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "true's one and false is seven .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can do it separately and then discuss it if that's what people wanna do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's actually scale .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one is true and so these are the questions we're answering .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes it's if it's fancy you put one , if it's really unfancy it's seven .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and one is one , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if it's somewhere in between you put four .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does it feel fancy ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "feels like play-dough .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they shouldn't really be questions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "should be more like are the batteries easy to insert ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm gonna say yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "imagine they're somewhere on the front .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have little case that you slip in .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "are we just about ready ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm supposed to use the whiteboard .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do we is it necessary ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's the marker thing kinda stopped working last time we our animals will forever be there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll just do .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "un unless you feel you need it to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't feel any so one point one ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we'll just go in circle .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so do we just add it up and divide it by four ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is that what the company does ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's four if you wanna do that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it adds to sixteen , so that's four .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it adds to thirteen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one five two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "she said five .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one five two is thirteen , over four for now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "wasn't cheating swear .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one point three is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's one was true and seven was false ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you really didn't like it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it was the other way round .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it was the other way round too .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we do have about the same thing , we just have it the other way gosh .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "sh was thinking one means no points , all the way up to the top .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it was one is true and false is seven .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "should've kept the table up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll just reverse them all .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's no problem .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'m glad this came out .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was like , why did you design it that way if you hated it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you hated it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's quite funny .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , starting again , one point one ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one point two ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one point three ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "two point one ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "two point missed two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that two point one ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "put it down as one point four for some reason .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one point four , one point five .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's have two of them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "mine has all kinds of problems .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "two and one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "two point two , which is one point five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "why did put three ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one on mine too .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "three point one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is that correct on my slide ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "three point one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one , four , three point two ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "three point three .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "four point one ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "four point two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "two and four point three .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one , two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so put one on that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll just do the calculations now if you want to continue .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or is it tedious ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no that's we should look at the ones that like where people said four , where it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm this was so tedious for everyone .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "didn't know how else to do it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the worst ones were three point one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do does every ones have the slide ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "three point one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the that was material .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "material technologically innovative , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you want to change it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what are the suggestions ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which one is that again ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "three point one ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that it's three point one was not that good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "four point one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "does the shape see i'm having trouble imagining the is it gonna be the size , like the controller ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "four point two ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it or bigger ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the wheel would probably be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and like then it you could hold it in your hand better .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the base would definitely be larger , 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they're kinda smallish .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no but imagine even if it was bigger , like if it's round and it's big then you can't get that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb so they could all be bananas and cucumbers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the flat one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but don't personally don't think this is comfortable to sit there , like it's an awkward position .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but like if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat but it's still too big , in your hand .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they're that stress ball they would be pretty squishable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and would it even resemble fruit that way ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like certain ones you'd have to limit the fruit selection , like you could probably do strawberry still .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the broccoli would be out .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you could do , although the broccoli is quite comfortable , have to say , like sorta like joystick .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that when you were holding that before , it actually looked .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that looked really good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are there any fruits that look like broccoli , no ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not that think of .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "these obscure fruits .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that broccoli is my favourite actually .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what if the it was just patterns on like we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like design on the rubber .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like just printed or coloured .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's just colour , and not necessarily the shape of strawberry .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that could work .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or we could even have fruit like around but if we need .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and just have the colour match .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if we wanna incorporate the fruit thing somehow , there might be if it in if it conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause no-one wants to hold remote that's uncomfortable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or like , some of you can think see as like you could if it was only this , if it was shaped like that , and it just had that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you see the problem is you have to attach that , and this has to be detachable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so like that's just too big because it's sorta like joystick .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "see the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that , which is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but is there some way we could make it this shape ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause like , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could make it that shape but just have different colours , and call the different fruits .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or like even or even like you said , like joystick like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like we could do i'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause that , that fits the whole round ipod idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you still have the comfort of holding it like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you could like if it's like this , you could put fruit designs and on that part .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it do we have any other ideas about that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "think the critical ones came out to be that one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could tr .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "batteries easy to insert for some reason , which can be easily that's not problem any more .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the batteries are going in the back ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that everyone gave that one or two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the reason ga didn't give it one gave it three because you'd have to like unc clip no you could just like any other one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no imagine there'd be hatch door , like on normal remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it would probably either in the no it can't be in the front 'cause the i_r_'s there , but it'd be on one of the sides probably .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "everyone's under three anyway .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's those are the only two points .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the broccoli wins .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'd agree with changing the shape .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was just having fun making strawberries and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we were bit off task .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so 't think of any so we'll have to like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you could make the touch pad in different shapes , but then that re-designs the whole project like , but you could do like that's true .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it might also annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it would probably cost more to produce , 'cause they're irregular .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "bet having different colours is lot cheaper than having different shapes too .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is why printing might be like just printing the fruit on fruit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not really 've done finance evaluation criteria , production evaluation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so project evaluation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you want this and we can all no .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're supposed to discuss the prod the process of the project and how satisfied , it's alright .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did you feel there was lot of room for creativity in the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "fruit and squishiness .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how more creative can you get ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the prototype making was very creatively stimulating and we've come up with product that's fun and meets all the criteria .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and how was our leadership and teamwork ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it was good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we knew what we were doing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it was very democratic process and everyone got to contribute .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "thought my leadership was crap personally .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "excuse me , am allowed to say that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you told us when to start and when to end , and that's all that matters .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you were fine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you did good job leading .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'m never gonna do management position , know that now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we all worked very together .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we didn't we it all blended quite .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it more than anything we didn't really have our set roles so much , as we just would be like , all had ideas about it but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no spats , that was good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the means for like the materials we used , how convenient were they ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like the pens , the whiteboard , we used are you mac person ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'m not big fan of any microsoft , powerpoint or any of this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no never touch macs either .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "use the unix or the off market , wordperfect and all these other things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which isn't very user-friendly though .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the problem is if you don't like my new computer never has wordperfect so have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then have to reinstall it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so have all these documents 't use now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "felt like my if it was just my role , but di that my the information that was available to me was just like or it was just the idea that we had .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but there's kinda it was kinda like , don't really think what i'm doing here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so didn't really was helpful .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so just made up my own and didn't really like the powerpoint presentations , so wrote lot of notes instead .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but don't really like powerpoint personally , t's kinda stupid .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "never use it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'t say found everything particularly helpful .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like it really ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it didn't really .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "though it was brilliant no ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "my first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how remote works .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no mine was really helpful as in my was quite helpful .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so like so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "my problem , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it depends on the role no ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it probably does .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause my problem was , you had access to like they'd put send you to sites and ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see couldn't do that , so didn't really you were doing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and when you were talking about it was just like that's wh that's why seemed so ignorant when you were explaining things , 'cause .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "mine was mostly made up except when they told me like titanium costs more than wood to make remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as if you'd wanted to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it must have been quite difficult for them to build whole system , 'cause they can't give you anything comparable to the internet for the , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it kinda thought that felt like would go and like try to use my information , or like i'd make this stupid little presentation and then like would end up talking about something completely unrelated because felt like was off-task all the time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's interesting how it all went together , like had the about how me how rubber's cheap , and you have how people want it to be spongy , and it seems planned .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we really got into talking about like personal practicalit like it wasn't necessarily what was like we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if hadn't been told that fruit was they're pretty .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "given certain information or just .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like if everyone's given the same input don't have clue , anyway .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "looks like no that's not it's quite .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what do you think of the pens ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it asks about that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they're kinda hard to write with though .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wanna i'd like to see what it looks like on the i'd like to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and i've forgotten once or twice to check the box .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they're nicer than the pen that i'm using , because like your actually shows up here , rather than having to look at the screen and write .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but even so , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and new ideas found ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's all very new , no ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's all very new .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like it was the microphones are when you're sitting down , but like they're kinda clumsy when you're like when you're going up to the whiteboard like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they drop off if you like move too much .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but don't think we're supposed to be testing these microphones .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that all this technology like some people must be interested in using it but 't imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone's notes , or like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the thing is , like actually worked in company , and had role and had to go to meetings .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and like the last thing would have wanted would be to have to watch video 'cause missed meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like usually missed meetings deliberately .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's just there's really not that much information that actually goes through real meeting , like when you're actually at real meeting in real company .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's mostly like rehashing old .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you're going over general that anybody who's on task should already know .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's like the there's just really not lot of information that goes through .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "seems like an excessive reiteration .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it seems like way overkill .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like if missed meeting could probably get it summed up in like one sentence .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wouldn't need to have to watch like two hour video with the sound and the transcript and i've learned not to bring play-dough to meetings .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it would be it's gotta be worth it to 'cause i'm just mostly curious about like what person or like company would really find it useful , 'cause can't really imagine , dunno .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "does anyone wanna talk about fruit more while we still have time ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "any other ideas for we still have time if there's any other input .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what what's the end ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are we supposed to you supposed to write report ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or we ending ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is that the end ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the we did really personally , which is why we've , gone through this so quickly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause we've all we all our product is satisfactory , it fits the budget , and it's trendy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "end of meeting .",
