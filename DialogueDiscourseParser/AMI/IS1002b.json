[{"edus": [{"text": "so we are here to talk about functional design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now hopefully we've all got better idea from than we did leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so here's an agenda .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you should know that i'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , as was struggling to our last time and that'll be easier for me now because i'm not actually giving the whole presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the additional points are just the that we sent and that forwarded on from upper management having few bright ideas to make our lives painful .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now you can all give your presentations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can talk about the requirements and hopefully come to some decisions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "forty minutes for this meeting , so bit more time than the last one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here's the additional points wanted to put those in there to see if you had any comments on them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did you all receive that email ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so does anyone have any overall .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing product that is going to be having no teletext , people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext , and so we're not we're gonna be new product without something that people are very comfortable having now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's , from marketing perspective see lack .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so we have to go , in the other direction .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what are we gonna have that makes this thing better than .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "tha that first point could also be an op opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated , some sort remote control that can work with the internet there is the opportunity that's presented , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , agree with you .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what i'm talking about is see that one side we're eliminating something so we have to come up with another side which is , what are we gonna be targeting our market that identifies our product as better than because it doesn't have teletext it has ta-ta-ta-ta-ta .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's that was my reactions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we are being dictated that this should only be for the television .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're quite fixed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're really probably , in terms of marketing , are looking for that's cost winner rather than fantastic new feature product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "bu but we we're designing only the remote , we not design the t_v_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any t_v_ that we people use our remote with .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we take with you .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's stupid decision .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but there's also the potential for mark there's market here for our lost teletext .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "someone that just goes to the shop that wants replacement wants it as cheap as possible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "twenty-five euros is the selling price , we really have to innovate here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's what i'm that's what i'm talking about is that we have to find something that is gonna be very attractive about this product 'cause somebody , some people are gonna be hap unhappy 'cause it took they can't ac access their teletext .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause we're talking about eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety-five percent of the televisions out there are teletext .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's not that i'm criticizing the product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what are we bringing in to take the place of this , and we have to in my opinion we have to double up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we lose one we need to bring two or three .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that the last point is probably quite straightforward .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the it has to be branded .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so then the double will be our tho thou rol ro rolls-royce might mind , but don't worry .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on the product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one of , one of the things that we should also keep in mind when we're doing this our company's slogan is we put the fashion in electronics , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can you handle that black and yellow ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so our target here is to have some very like sleek look remote and we want it to be functional as , but one of the main selling points is that we don't want it to be clunky like this thing here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we don't wanna big clunker .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we want something that looks and it's fashionable and so that's fine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you have this ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we have three presentations , and we'll go in order of participant number here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can have look at the working design first from participant two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you all know me , i'm the industrial designer .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but click it on off ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we've some basic components that our remote is gonna need , just every remote'll need .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we need some kinda of power source .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have to decide on our user interface , which is his department , but the in user interface is also major component .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we need programmable digital signal processor to take the input from the user and translate that into electronic signal , which we pass to the infra-red l_e_d_ , which you aim at the television which and it receives that signal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you need on-off switch how that got in there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we also need to have the if we want universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of t_v_s .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we need to know all the different all the different signals and so that'll require some memory as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so here's just basic layout of how the remote would work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you ha the power source is in the upper right-hand corner there , and you can see that we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing , and then passes that signal on to the infra-red l_e_d_ and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo-transistor .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so those are the basic components that need to go into this and everything else is open to move around .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now is would this be considered just standard this is not this is not cutting edge technology we're talking here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "any des no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're talking about existing technology .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is just this is just basic layout of ev of all the components that are gonna be necessary to have working remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "nothing is being modified or upgraded or new discoveries .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition , that you can kinda say would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do we have an idea of costs of different components ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the most costly components are gonna be the chip and the it could als the user interface and the casing are gonna be expensive as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the l_e_d_ and the transistors and everything else are they're pretty cheap .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so depending on what we want our functionality to be , the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "depending on the amount of memory we need in there and like that and how much power .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do we have any ballpark figures for that yet ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't have any figures now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have to until we get to more specific design phase for that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but and significant part of the cost could be the actual casing itself and the buttons and things like that , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's all have really .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we have participant three , which believe is pedro .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "give you that to click on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you wanna get view slide show , that's what you wanna do , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when we're fighting over it's also more lot more fun .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just go up to view .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "click , don't .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but what the management recommendation was less that there's worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this doesn't work .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so function design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you know me , pedro , and what found is we want to do fashion and , honestly , we should keep technology low and just simple and try to aim for design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if case will cost the same if it looks good or bad so we ma we have to make it look good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "something cute and small .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the big chunky remotes are died in the eighties .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we should just go that people will like to actually look at .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and although mo most people will buy televisions and everything for that have loads of little functions and everything and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things and most the people won't get too mad of actually having to go the to the television to , tune in their the stations .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's no need to have that in the remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so as for what would recommend for the interface design , and will change the colours on the logo , but we should go for the user-oriented device , so simple controls and good ergonomics .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and although i'm still here recommending the teletext so i'll remove that , but we should go for the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so still it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include , it really should be in there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because otherwise we're just going to even if it's necessary or not , if you if you're given the choice between remote with teletext or without when it really if it isn't more expensive for us to make because as far as understand it , it can be operated with the same set of buttons , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as far as it's just the cost of an extra button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it should be in there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "software-wise there's really no difference .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "isn't what we're getting into here is the idea of internet through the t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have silly question .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in the very beginning it said with the advent of computers there's gonna be the it's gonna be out-moded teletext .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't understand how those two things are connected .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how does computers and teletext how why is one eliminating the need of the other ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't understand that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that might play on what we can do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the they're aiming at saying that you would use couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for the scheduling and the next programme and like that and now you can look it over internet .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to find out what you're watching even if there's commercials .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but still think teletext is way more convenient until we have the same commodities .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause , don't see the cross-over between computers and television .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do see the cross-over in some sense , but with the remote is used for television , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's not happen yet .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have digital t_v_ still already .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if we make the cross-over and we're gonna view television on computers then we're losing the necessity of the remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "unless you have .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there is on digital t_v_ systems you have you can press button and you can buy things in adverts , and you can view through catalogue .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "family member of mine has got system where you just you can , and there's other features on other systems where you can pause live t_v_ and things like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they're just features from the internet from computers are coming into the t_v_ under the covers , but you still use it through teletext .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so now the things to think here are that there's gonna be more functionality , potentially that we can handle .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we don't we're not aiming command for that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and but we would increase the price to try to make it trainable one , so dunno .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "lot of that's proprietary anyways .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you're not gonna be able to , you , like command tivo with our remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but still there there's an opportunity .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if it's , trainable one then we're just simply having like an up , down , left , an button like that might do as future proofing it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one way the other teletext was there but we can remove it or , make two separate interface designs .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it's possible you should try to have talk with management about that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just it's just not .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't see the logic .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't see the logic in elimination of teletext , but i'm not tech-mind either .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and neither do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't see the cross-over between computers and 'cause we are designing something for television , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll communicate that back to those there and the message really we wanna be sending to them is that , although teletext may become outdated there's no logic in not having it in there anyway if it doesn't affect the price .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we are selling it to an existing market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but what they're pushing us towards here is in terms of thinking of ways to future-proof our system for future systems that have something else other than teletext .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we're not putting some there's no putting anything in the place of teletext .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's , and we're also marketing product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's the problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's what i'm seeing is mid-range cost product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we can't go and pump whole bunch of technology into this thing because all of sudden we are gonna have cost overruns .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if we drop if we are gonna choose to drop teletext , again what are we adding to the product that makes it marketable ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if we're keeping it basic we're loo what we're looking to sell it is it's just being very easy to use , looking exceptionally good , that thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause we really don't have anything else there , do we ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't see it , and to me if i'm gonna market product for beauty for design i'm gonna try to market it at much higher price .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "need to make it special with high price tag .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't want to make it economically competitive .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "want to market it as exclusive .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so would market this product it at eighty-nine euros and come up with some really beautiful exterior design but don't think we have that flexibility .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but if design is cheap and functionality is basic , then twenty-five euros is probably high price for commoner garden stan standard t_v_ so the place remote the then the place we're going to justify that cost is through design through making it sleek elegant high-priced basic remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does that make sense , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no understand what you say , but what i'm , we probably need to move along , but my concern is trying to find marketing niche for this product , and if i'm coming in with twenty-five euros , which is mid-market price , then what am going to give these people for this ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we probably should .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we we're doing alright for time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's just my question , but we can keep talking .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that kinda cut into you there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no just would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as for , the case design i'll come up with more concrete ideas .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now it's just the idea of simplicity and slickness , cute and small .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm just thinking with all these universal remotes that are out there , how many people how many people actually use every feature that ar like these trainable remotes and things like that , where , it's just so confusing to do to use all these functions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "where the largest portion of the market is just gonna they lost their t_v_ remote , they need another one that'll work with their t_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they want something that looks , that isn't gonna break when they drop it , that it's ergonomic , it feels good in your hand , something like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's gonna be where you're gonna find the biggest , market share .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we are looking that looks good and just works , rather than looking for any special features .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the more bells and whistles we add , it's just gonna cut into our profits .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because as we add costs for things like for like if we add the voice recognition and things like that , what percentage of the market is actually gonna use that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "five percent , and how much .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we can talk little bit more potentially in the marketing presentation about this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "be good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "didn't mean to cut in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm not the boss .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "pedro , want to say quickly would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "sell things come to my mind is something that's voice-activated .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "know we're getting into some , hope , some big money on this thing , but is that for over here ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's probably question more for this guy here , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "t's kinda both of us .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "us user interface .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's 'cause and of voice-activated of how many times i've lost my remote and 't find it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so some way that find my remote by clapping my hands and so but this 's just something .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was thinking about that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then your lights would go off , though .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm trying to find some bells and whistles 'cause when they talk about tel taking out teletext , it's like , what are we gonna put in ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what makes this thing attractive ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it's only for televisions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we everyth our competition out there has got these multiple adaptors where they can use for their v_c_r_s , their d_v_d_s , their televisions and we're coming out with one remote for television only .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so to me we have to make this really special product don't really have to say don't see the market niche for this product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "at this price don't see it yet .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm go along with this , because this is what we're given to try to market , but don't see the market niche for this product without some really something really special to identify it as unique in the market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we that should be design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that should be the design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "technology we'd we we're not in the price range to do it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we don't have the money to do it towards technology so we should aim at design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have to do you have to do it in the box ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's up to you then to make this box in something that's extraordinary .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "make it in the form of gun .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can sell it in united states .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have question for you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does any of the features that pedro's spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about on in terms of just pure functionality ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in terms of making it work or the cost of that or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't all these things are pretty standard .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "onto participant four .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for marketing for me is and how do go here ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can just click .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no you just get off that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you just click anywhere .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what for me is it what i'm marketing now , 'til you spoke and when wrote this , what i'm marketing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "know that was identified as we identified ourselves as developer , as manufacturer , and as distributor to other wholesalers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so the twenty-five euros that we've identified as the sale price is wholesale price rather than retail price .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's what we decided here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what did is decided that this needs to be product in sense can market itself .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what we've identified here as our main marketing stratagem is in design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're making the most beautiful attractive whatever we decide it is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that means we have about seven more minutes or ten minutes left .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so would like to have product that we can sell easily .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so say inspiration , so having something beauty , something attractive , something that in sense will sell itself .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "innovation fits into what we're talking about here with design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "cutting edge technology , don't think we're gonna have that , these were ideas was putting together , unless we come up with some new age product as far as the casing is concerned .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "wanna make this thing something that identify as special in some way , so we can have some talked about environmentally sensitive , we have product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in home .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these are just thoughts .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "wanted to talk about who we are as corporation , that we're new , we're aggressive , we're competitive , we're trying to provide product from new perspective rather than from an old corporate line .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so to me it's about selling our identity our corporate identity along with the product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what found is that the projected costs are competitive .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're in the middle of the market , but what i'm seeing is that the market is ready for identified new technology , but again , because what see is budget restrictions and limitations , that we can bring any new technology into this thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we could have technological something .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have an idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it's along the lines of environmentally sensitive , and it may even fit into ergonomics , and even address the issue of losing the remote , what we were saying it's common issue .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what we can do is , that batteries throwing aw remotes run through batteries like crazy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and for some people .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not solar remote but instead what about if we had like power cradle ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but solar blah , like it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like cradle that is there to hold the remote when you're not using it , so you'll always know where the remote is 'cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote , and we can , instead of having instead of having , replaceable batteries we'll just have power cell that stays there for the life of the remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you never have to get go through the go through all these different batteries .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and also you can it's good opportunity for the user design or for not just for the user design , but also for the just for the look and feel of the remote as whole .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you could have some neat little , sexy design for cradle and the remote itself .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like the idea , but we're talking about in cost is gonna probably double .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it would increase the cost .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but boy , we can sell this thing , because there's no batteries , it's environmentally sensitive , we can identify it as safer product in some form .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and you could page the remote if you lose it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's button on the cradle .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "really see but the cost no .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now the question is can we make this for less than twelve-fifty per ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , we have to change the end cost .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there's don't see it anyway .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we do we necessarily have to change the end cost because can we dl can we do that without changing it twelve-fifty per product , if we can sell more based on this ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's gonna be up to these .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "my reaction is no , but , see i'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what do is look into ho pedro and look into how much this might increase our costs and you can look into what effect an increased cost is gonna have on our final numbers .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can certainly push for more expensive product if that's gonna be nah , we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's sell this wholesale for fifty euros , sixty euros .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's make this thing really exclusive , environmentally sensitive , high-tech design , ergonomics , all of this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just make this thing , the rolls royce of remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "every home's got to have it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you don't have one , what remote do you have ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you've got one of those , fantastic , want one of those too .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't have enough money now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "about that , because in order to do that in order to price it at that level we'd need to have every functionality the other competitors are offering like being able to operate , the d_v_d_ player and , the stereo system and all that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is pretty basic function that we've opted out of .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and additionally we're not supporting teletext but do think there are some basic features that we don't have that lot of other remotes are going to have .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one thing don't understand is they've given us this package , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now in my opinion we need to give them package back , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they say here you go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they gave us fundament foundation of what they want , and it's our place to kinda analyse and evaluate .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't t's our place to create their product for them , it is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what role we have in this in the corporate ladder , but to me it's like , you have got your here's our ideas , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then let them look at those ideas and they say , we can raise the price twenty percent , we like this idea , this idea no , but to me it's about choice , do we follow their directives or do we make presentations back and then discuss ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "beca do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing us now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't see it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don have to disagree though .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "our market niche is people who need who have lost their remote or who've broken their remote and don't wanna send back to the manufacturer , they just wanna run out to the store and get remote , and then they're gonna look on the shelf and they're gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it does what they need .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "these aren't that it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and to get to back to another point , for cutting in but , it's important to remember that this remote has to work with multiple t_v_s , 'cause it's selling on its own .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not going to be specifically for hitachi t_v_s or whatever .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no understand that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so technologically , if understand it , t_v_s t_v_ remote's working exactly the same way as video remotes and d_v_d_ remotes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "all you need to do is train them to the individual one , all you need to do is know the like some four-digit code .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so saying that it works with all t_v_s is equivalent to saying that it'll work with d_v_d_s and other things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "nope , they've identified the product as not working for anything but televisions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you wouldn't the interface will be different .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they've identified this product limita that's why say don't see the market niche for this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have done this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we were going to have product that worked for d_v_d_s , v_c_r_s and everything , then see the market niche , but we we're only identified as going for televisions without teletext .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it's like whoa we ha in my opinion we have to go with something that's extremely exclusive to make this thing marketable , because who wants just television remote ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we he here's my thing about that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you're in the market for this ultimate remote , you're not gonna go for just television remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it can't control if it can't control your d_v_d_ player and al if you can't get th-in-one ultimate remote , that just you can throw all your other remotes away .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm not gonna buy seventy-five euro remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have tendency to agree with you .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we really can't chase that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's why say quest question the marketability of the product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "really question where we create the demand .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what we so that's what i'm saying .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're really looking basic .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the one thing that you said really struck chord with me here in that we're carrying the corporate identity with the product , but we're actually looking for large profit at the same time where i'd be inclined to go back to upper-level management and say like let's just cut down our profit expected on this product because we are actually branding our company here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're selling more than just the product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're trying to get mind-share about real reaction to the people who are gonna buy consumer electronics .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we want people to eventually say , that's real reaction that's good make .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we're gonna make it we're gonna win mind-share by either being fantastic product or for it working , it just being good , reasonable-priced , and solid .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if we can make if we can put an emphasis here on it not breaking that's in itself an extremely big thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you drop the cost , now if you make if you make go to the other side of the cost scale , and you make it less expensive , then all of sudden now we're going into an new market area .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we can say low-cost good design , beautiful , wa-da-da-da-da-da .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we only have few minutes left .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but what i'm saying is now we're middle market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is twenty-five euros mid-market price for remote ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for multi for multi-function remote , that's mid-market price .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in discount now you can buy on sale sometimes for about eighteen , nineteen euro , and that's for the multi-functions , d_v_d_ , v_c_r_ , catch-alls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and they have in little box in the middle , and this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so to me , to market this only television remote control we have to change consciousness .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have to have something that will change people's thinking to identify this as advantageous , and what that is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's gotta be low-cost or high-cost with special design features .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'d be inclined to say , if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost , then that's the way we really should play it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we can take it down to fifteen rather than twenty-five and make low profit-margin on it , but we're really doing that to sell the brand .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have five minutes left .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "rather to sell for real reactions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or my we're talking about the other end now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and communicate this to the more senior people within the company here to get reaction .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what about the idea that had with the cradle ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how do you feel about that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or how does everybody feel ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how does everybody feel ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the other the problem with that in my mind think off-hand as consumer , would wanna buy that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like the idea , but we have to find out .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , but that's the thing don't t's necessarily the other end .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and not because i've got remote and i'll take it to different chairs , i'll take it to different don't wanna go over somewhere and put it down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it if it is gonna be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair , and that implies that there's only one t_v_ user .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's very good for some people but it's not like but it takes away the ease of use of the remote to certain extent .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "lasts it would last for several hours on its own power , but when you're done with it you put it back in the cradle .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have to remember .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have to shift down the side of the couch to find it and put it back and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it in my mind it doesn't seem like something that i'd really want because of that fact .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , that's just my opinion .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "again it's it we have cost issue here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we're gonna go in this direction , to me we're going to the other side of the cost range .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are we gonna make this selling the cost as high high-tech environmentally sensitive whatever , or are we gonna go to the lower side of the range ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "again don't see our market niche in the middle for our product yet .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't see it yet .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what do we think we should pedro , do you have any opinion on it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we should keep it simple , medium-low cost mar cost area and make it look good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "question have in 'cause agree with you on , we gotta make it box .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the box is gonna sell it , the outside , the casing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "really need to wrap up now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can we have multiple designs ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have modern , have traditional , have , and so instead of them all looking the same , people can have four or five different designs they can choose from .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what that creates cost , or one over another .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the problem with that is we may end up with whole bunch of inventory of poor design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", hear that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so but what we could do is some we need to , have few designs to look at and then come up with something that we all agree is , the best fit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what's really important is it has to look good , it has to feel it has to feel good in your hand , it has to be durable , it has to and it's really important that it doesn't look cheap .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have to make people look at it an and feel like it its like quality remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "even though the cost may be low .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what ab what about remote that's that doesn't look like remote ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just an idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just 'cause we all remote looks like on the outside .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they're selling these things everywhere .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that could be part of our design exclusivity , is we make remote that doesn't even look like remote it opens like telephone .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or what if it looks like pen ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "doesn't matter , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm just jus talking about some something to make this thing unique .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it that's the thing , i'm gonna keep thumping on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll sell whatever you design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't have problem selling product , that's not the issue .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "give you ideas , you create the product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "once you have the finished product i'll find way to sell it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't worry about it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "give you these things now , because these are my thoughts and feelings .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so just to touch on my point one last time that had brought up .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "really un unless you are die-hard against the fact that it's possible like it reduces the usability of the remote and the fact that you can't lose it on your own , it still might be good idea to investigate having like power cradle .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because really in certain sense it almost like for me would want to have that just , because know at the end of when i'm done watching t_v_ that when i'm done , better go find the remote and put it back where it belongs .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's just some people that like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's al there's also remote controls remember that worked , this hasn't been done in while , but as watch .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "lot of people as watch ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there is remote control watches , but they're sorta eighties thing , so it might not be easy to market in it but the technologies came along and it might be cheaper to make now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they are not simple .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "those things may have been inexpensive for all know .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one thing thought about when you were saying that , is that the our target market is gonna be someone who has lost or broken we gotta stop ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's what was saying .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "who's lost or broken their remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "gotta cut up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so how many remotes do they wanna buy ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can we sell them remote that can guarantee they will not need to buy another one ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so with this system or locator , to think about , how have people been losing or breaking their remote ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how does this happen ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the last remote you'll ever buy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and also presumably they've exactly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then design the product , some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you'll ever need to buy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we're going down that then we can we don't need to go the it strikes me that the locator feature might actually be quite expensive to make .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "whereas actually just putting it in power cradle might not be too expensive because that's just done with mobile phones you can just we have said we have actually similar products that we can take from and potentially cut costs there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the locator'll definitely be more expensive .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "need to look into whether we can do that but we have some mobile phone-based products checking quickly our internet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we really need to finish up here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can make it in the shape of coffee pot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we have the power-adaptor products .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we sell power-adaptor products .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so there's nothing stopping us using that technology .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's just it's that it's telling us to stop our meeting .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we have the we probably have on-line in our system , we have the ability to create this , we're talking about .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , without it being too we can cut costs through using the manufacturing that's already gonna be in place here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we can create this we have probably five or six or seven really strong marketing characteristics .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one of the things that we can put on the box is , never buy another battery .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "something like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no that's not what want , want look it here .", "speaker": "D"}], "id": "xxxxx", "relations": [{"y": 1, "x": 0, "type": "Explanation"}]}]
