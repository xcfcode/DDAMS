[{"edus": [{"text": "so now we are on the conceptual design meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "getting close to the last is the penultim meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how was lunch ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't be sarcastic .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so will again do the secretary part we will have three presentation first the industrial design , first rama then mark and then sammy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to take decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the first on the component concept , so what energy we use what chip on print and one ki case .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and also on user interface concept what interface we use and if there is some supplements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and at the end sammy will give trend watching on what he's been doing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's so , let's go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first with rama .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're to mainly design mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for energy there are two or three possibilities .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "first one , we can use simple battery , or we can use traditional solar cells or and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this r_s_a_ and then titanium , which can be which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal display .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we can use some , moving thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , as we discussed before , we need to we would like to have some speech recognition chip in our remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this can be simple programmable chip and which can use microphone sensors .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we also want to look at our remote control , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "still we are looking for possible technical specifications and how easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to in our twelve euros or around that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in room or in house .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we discussed an excuse me .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic to have enough energy with the solar cells and so we would like to just use simple battery .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or and the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what is double-curved shape ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like you can have two curves .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's in manufacturing it's problematic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need simple chip and it's really lesser re really less expensive compared to which are which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive , since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition we want to reduce cost .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "want to know why it just but for the point before why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and also like in if you put it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you titanium it's more yes so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can use something like the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or some rubber parts like to make it feel better and to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like in cell phones recently these you can with the rubber in four directions and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but full assembly we'll use mainly for titanium rubber is expensive and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and this push buttons we would like to use push buttons instead of l_c_d_s and so we want to mo we're we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money for we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology , so it's like we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and because the speech recognition technology will take at least five euros or so we want to reduce the cost on display or this inter , that can we can consider , because like it won't take much money , because , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , so simple button and speech recognition for the more complicated .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and still we have can we still include the l_ l_s_d_ display ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "seems not , it's either or push-button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , it's not gonna be no touchable but still like source of information or source for menus .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so let's try it , let's , it's not gonna be touch pad , just display for giving you information .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the would the display would only be display and not touch sensitive you mean .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just for output , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you have any further questions or ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the batteries are going to be very light .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're to go for li and now we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries for really light batteries and with good price .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this device on that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just the finding it , instead of clapping why not just be ask .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's then the one thing we want to like because remote control is used for like in the household so it will be it at least five , six people want to use it so how to define our re speech recognition whether we want to do speaker independent or speaker dependent .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really more technology and so , if everybody in the house to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for the location .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so let's now go to the you don't have more question ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , it's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no more questions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "puts less of constraint on what we can do but it's always like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have dreams and the in the end we find out that it's not feasible .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have some limitations .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but still l_s_d_'s already quite , l_c_ i'm an artist , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "l_s_d_ is something else , and it's quite as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , go on artist .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , that's not hope that's not too much .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now let's talk about interface .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "participant number three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have look at this no it's .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the concept of the interface .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "generally developed quite broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user's manual and all the complex things that come together with your t_v_ and remote controls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so let's start with this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we got our perfect remote control with lot of buttons and we got explanation for every button and you can use your time and it will take some days to learn all this buttons and the is going to be somewhere here and go back button , really where it is , one of this buttons , and power on and off don't remember so it should be this button is power on and off ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's our concept .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's called the millennium remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let's change millenniums .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you can use in the end and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "doesn't make sense .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is very ugly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you like it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , too much concept .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just press the button , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we will not use this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we will not use this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but instead of this will devise that's our concept .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it's got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this we already discussed .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and what will people say ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they'll say it's perfect .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or what will say ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they will say it's splendid .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and everyone will say i'll buy it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and everyone's gonna be satisfied .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you can come in several colours ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or did the but not the case .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would make backlight of the screen with different colours .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not the case .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the case would only be in that aluminium titanium , like , they like something which is , so that would be the option .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because from your survey people like colours , no ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so let's remember there's nokia phone which changeable panels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you like it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't have nokia phone , but don't use that but again , might , bu but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's but it would be expensive , no ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's why you don't have it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's why , 'cause it's nasty .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you use colour .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "instead of that we can change the colour of the assembler .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can just if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this the shapes and they can have different assembly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so users have different they have their own interests , colour interests and so we can just if they want they can just pay another two euro .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", so you propose something with option that increase the price if we if you want more colours on , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if they want like so that we can .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "upgradable remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just they'll get few more things and few more colours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what there's one more decisi one more solution , 'cause there are some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and thermodynamic also .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can make it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that's mo too much expensive , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it can be in an gradable version , but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because there are two kinds of people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "those for which the remote control is to be something useful i'm going to talk about this later but and those for which is something that is specific to them so it it's like signature .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "my remote control is pink .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "nobody else than me has pink remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that makes me special .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and you think that we don't have to make them pay more because of or this is , so it's not base service it's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they would be ready to pay more for that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "those who wanted to have it pink .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , be an option , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it might be optional , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but those people will be really few , no ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so like we can those .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the young people the young people want to be different from their friends .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "although similar but have something just slightly better .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's if that it's selling point it has to be the base .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it makes you different , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you'll be different .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you always have your remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in the train , hello no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "anyone has their remote controls here ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you don't have your remo wh you like take the ipod .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "want to change my neighbour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's white and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it has this distinctive look and feel and look which people seems to like just because it's colour that we don't usually see in remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that they can use it in darkness , like .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "glow in the dark , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "hand light , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like the infrared like we can put some radium chips so that like at least .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let's go on with the presentation .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the remote control's going to be smart but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that's question to you and to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so heard that it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done so that's the smartness of the thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or beer cans with speech recognition but we may have remote controls with speech recognition .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so just think about it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't touch the remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are you saying here that the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesn't want .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "want to say it should be real smart .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like with some fingerprint recognition or .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "voice recognition is quite tough .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "say don't use it , and the control just looks .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause ordered jus to lock it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that could be feasible , like so since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition so we can use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it could be smart in that way .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but i'm thinking about the other particularity that the remote control could have .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "since it knows who is using it , it might also record the channels you are more often using and levels of volumes that you're more often things like that and provide you ways of using them , somehow , that might be expensive but that might also be good sales pitch again .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the remote that knows you .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's , marketing expert .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'm going to talk about trends and hope this can help us to understand how we should design our remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , next slide .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so first just small recap on how do we watch trends so it's not so simple you might think that it's easy but it's not so simple .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "anyway these days the best source of information is the web as , so have to go often on the web and look at what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day or any other tool that is similar to remote control which is small device that people have with them , always , like phone .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can use the phone as good example of where to in be inspired .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "those tha who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired because they're not only watching the trends , they're inventing it , they're creating the trend .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "hope i'm going to try to help you on that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is more risky because you're not following the trend , you try to invent it , which means either you succeed and you make lot of money or you don't and you're out of business .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so anyway next slide .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to be quick there's lot of words here but there are in the market of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have fancy look and feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and interestingly this is the very most important thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it has to be fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically innovative , it has to be new with some of new technology inside and this is also more important than the last thing which we may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so as you see it first have to be very , something that people are proud of that they can be id identified with and then something that contains very novel that they can talk about with their friends , mine has this and not yours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and finally it has to be useful as remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and now in more general broad way of seeing the thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we look back and not look at only remote controls it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so currently the trends that we see in big cities like paris and milan , it seems that this year things should have fruit and vegetable way of look or feel or so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it applies to everything .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's the thing with trends .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it can travel from clothe to furniture same idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fruit and vegetable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "think fruit and vegetable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what is spongy ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this so when we were talking about rubber , the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so titanium it's not good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "seems not , seems not .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we need to think about .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so think more of something in the colours of like fruit and vegetables and spongy , as even in the shape it has to be more round and more look natural somehow .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it seems to be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and not those futuristic remote control with angles and titanium like .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's what people seem to t's quite far from what you thought but that's fashion and that's all have to say .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you have questions ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or it's this you so did you where ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have people listening to the trends everywhere in the world , as our company is quite big and so i'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask their friends that are also .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's not from .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's more general trend it's not particular to the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , it's not this is very general , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it seems that trends travel across things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the what we .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but some materials they're to be they're to be something like solid like they can't be really spongy or .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have to we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables but we still have to put our chips inside , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "sponge , at least that's that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is your problem .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is not mine .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these things can be easily incorporated .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can have colours or this shape or at least .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in the colours and in the material .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it's something like rubber made or it it's also going to be good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no more question ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we will have next meeting in thirty minutes again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now you have to go straight on this individual action which are for rama wil design , mark the user interface design , and sammy the product evaluation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "look and feel de .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you will work together on new on prototype using modelling clay .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , can we highlight the specific features of our , so we want the speech recogniser and we want some buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , that's we want to follow general trend .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you're , you have to so you say do we agree on that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , do you think .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we have to for so are we confident enough on creating trends ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , we don't have to , but seems it's the trend .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "again , as said we can also try to make it , to create the trend .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so there's no , that's you can try to convince us .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can make it smell like fruit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's so what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's good idea , it's again in this what said first it has to be fancy so if nobody else pro provides currently remote control with that and if we can provide it it's good sell for us because we have it and others don't .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so titanium smell like fruit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or they really like they more want these fancy features like feature .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "agree with this now we have to decide on what fanciness .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy fruity-like .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we will try to explore these two options and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you could explore the two option .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "could we make titanium shape ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "at least like we can make banana or it's that's we're to look for and we're to see the whether rubber is expensive and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't you say that you cannot do double shape curved shape .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but doub double-curved .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "seems to be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to make the like titanium panels on whole rubber body .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you explore now that you're going to work together these two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or spongy an .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one titanium .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have only the plastic or the chippy fibre chips or .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you have time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't think we have to choose .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we choose titanium or if we choose spongy but it cannot be both .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "really don't like this modelling clay 'cause it makes some for we'll look .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can pretend that it's titanium .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can paint it afterward .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have very large department of paint .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do don't worry , you speak with .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you will do it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright , alright .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so explore shape .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so still we want to keep ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's what we say , that we have an with information .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the thing is that if we want to have as he says if we want to have small number of buttons we need to have output that says currently what their actions are .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then we can , that user friendly or .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the converse to having zillions of button where each button does only one thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or , because .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "classical , we stay classical in that we don't reinvent the wheel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "anyway it's very in general people change t_v_ more often than batteries of their remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because the trend goes faster than the life of the so it's very .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so are we .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so see you in thirty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}], "id": "xxxxx", "relations": [{"y":
