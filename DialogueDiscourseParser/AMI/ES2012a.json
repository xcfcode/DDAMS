[{"edus": [{"text": "welcome to the first meeting of real reaction's development meetings for our new television remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this follows our very successful entry into the consumer market over the last year or so which we want to build on , taking advantage of the latest developments in technology and the latest feelings in consumer design and demand and we want to make this the very best product that's possible for everybody , one that everybody wants , at good price for the consumer and at good price for the company .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and to that end we need all to work together to do that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and in no particular order because ev everybody is just as vital to this project i'll just go round the table , andrew , marketing , kendra with the designing the user interface and kate with the industrial design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what's the project is here to do , is to get this project up and moving , ev everybody is free to say wh whatever they want , everybody has contribution to make and everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to say what you want to say .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in terms of the immediate meeting the everybody knows everybody else , everybody's worked for the company for while , if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves do , if anybody wants to briefly give their background so that everybody's quite clear what everybody everybody's experience is do so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'd welcome anybody to say something briefly about themselves , we will do that by going round the table quickly and saying what contribution you you're looking to make .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we'll start with andrew .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my name's andrew i'm the market research person for this meeting and this project for creating this new remote control and i'll be presenting information statistics on what people want to get from this new design , what people want to like and from fashion point of view and the practicality point of view .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm kendra and i'm the us user interface designer and haven't had whole lot of experience in this thing before but i'm so i'll be working on the design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "at least means you haven't got any preconceived ideas so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm just open to being creative .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm katie , i'm the industrial designer and i'll just be presenting about the inter workings of our little remote control and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "very quickly , this don't want to make this meeting too structured because the whole idea is that it's think tank .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "everybody says what they want to say , and we don't want to be constrained by convention or slides on screens or anything else but briefly this is what we want to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the remote control needs to be original , there has to be something about it that other remote controls don't have so that as soon as people see it they think yes that's different , want one , and that goes along with being trendy , the want it scenario .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "user-friendly as we all know , remote controls can be very user-unfriendly so we want to make ours one that people can pick up and think yes that's it's obvious how that works , and they also want to look at the price and think that's something that may not need another remote control but it's such one i'm gonna have one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and last but not least , or first of all , it must make the company money , and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the further work to be done is the functional design , what it must actually do , the conceptual design , how we actually present that to the consumer and the detailed design is how we get that into production .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is the white board and let us very quickly do what it says in the prompt slide here , suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the wires , that we don't do that , so everybody knows what whiteboard is so we'll do virtual drawing on the whiteboard of your own favourite animal , but le let's go round the table , your favourite animal .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's got contrast with black and white and feel they're underdog status and they're , the make mobile phones and t_v_ remotes to make t_v_ remotes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "my wife says my beard looks like badger's arse 'cause of the white streaks in it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "probably duck li like the way they look and they're just animals and like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'s horses , no particular reason why .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm not that i've got any favourite animal to be quite honest , homo sapien because of their overall ability to ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , tha that's and we need to keep in mind here that the we want to sell this for twenty five euro , we want to make an overall profit for the company of fifty million euros so we're looking at selling lot of these ag across the entire planet and we're looking at gross profit of fifty percent .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it needs to cost twelve euros fifty to make .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're not only looking at very trendy original product , we're looking at making it at very good price .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", would anybody like to start by giving their quick views of current remote controls .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "find lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and it's handiest when you have one that works both the d_v_d_ player or whatever and the t_v_ as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that it's easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press bunch of different buttons and so it's is best when they're clearly labelled and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "any thoughts about buttons or any oth other way of approaching the problem ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or anybody else , strong feelings about remote controls ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are there , bad ones they've used or good ones they've used or ones that they've lost and never found again ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's important that you should be able to when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from anywhere and you shouldn't have to like contort yourself and twist your remote control to get it the t_v_ to actually pick up the signal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "think lot of the time , remotes that come with t_v_ players and t_v_s and d_v_ players , like they aren't like an area that's put lot of effort into , they're very boring , very plain .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like it's very like making stylish remote control would be very like easily put us one step ahead of the current competition .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what so wh what's in what particular style features are you thinking about ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "something that looks doesn't look like remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if you want , something that looks like something that makes you think what's this ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like this pen doesn't really look like pen , but it makes you think .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , that's bit vague .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no do you think there's risk if it doesn't look like remote control , people won't see it as remote control and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "suppose that's up to the marketing to make people aware of the product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "any other thoughts about the physical appearance of remote controls ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "something that's comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big , rectangular things and they're awkward to hold onto , so something that's more comfortable that fits in person's hand better .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the thing that immediately comes to mind is computer mouses which you get all sorts of shapes in the shops and some quite fancy ones than the some from personal experience which look but aren't particularly comfortable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "any thoughts about buttons or flat screens or yes , the only thing is if you're watching television in darkened room you need to be able to fi find the button buttons easily .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "from the mouse idea you could , remote is piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it which you press , whereas if you want could all be flat and the buttons are very almost subtle that instead of being raised out of the device you push into device you see , like mouse button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be down so you could feel them better .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's must admit don't 've ever seen one with concave buttons , that's certainly be different .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do we need it to 't think of any re remote controls that know of that actually light up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do we want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would be good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like mobile phone ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that would be good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something which there are already millions out there and that we want to take over the entire the planet with ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "especially if we try to sell , what two million of them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "four million of , but if we market it as not this you could either market it as the point of view we could have the two we could have parallel marketing schemes where you've got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks , is fashionable and like you just it's like it's one that rather than ra wan want rather than need relationship with the device , but that might considering the act what the device is for and the nature of some people might not like respond to having device that they just looks , therefore they want it so make it practical at the same time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room but also device that is practically sound .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , we'll have to decide which angle we're gonna go to or both .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", an any facets that we identify we aim need to aim for all of .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first thoughts on the industrial design side .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's remote controls are unique object 'cause it's you depend on them so much , but you don't it's you just assume they're always gonna work , you don't think of them as comp like computer can break down and you're kinda like fair enough there's all these complex things going on , it's gonna something's gonna get messed up eventually .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they just need to be very dependable because people take them for granted and then if your remote control breaks it's forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel it just it needs to be very effective , very always dependable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't think we should make it too small 'cause it needs to it can't be too big like you were saying big an and huge and awkward , but also if you make it too small kinda like how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller , it's just gonna end up under couch cushion somewhere and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but so yes dependable , and have good medium range size .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and colours , materials ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "kendra , anyone ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey , so we should go with something different or be able to was just thinking of what they're doing with mobile phones now how you can get the different what are they called ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like the face-plates that you change so we could have if it would be feasible to do something with that , where you can change the face-plates or have variety so people can get different things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have it look how they want to , different colours , things like that , probably just plastic because that's always the lightest .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's again don't think that's ever been done before , it's the thing that would get people thinking yes that's something that haven't got and might need so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "andrew , any thoughts about how we might market interchangeable fronts on the remote control ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "could either market it together by getting control in set colour or with like you buy it with several like you ge you get the face-plates with it when you buy or as separate thing , but thinking of that , it's considering the nature of the device , second thing like second campaign to market new facials for your to your might go bit astray since it is the thing where you generally get one and then forget about it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "unless you were trying to .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you could come up with like novelty ones , like they've done with the mobile phones , you can get like different scenes from different movies and on the remote control and sorta stagger the release of them and get people like want that cover on it now and that'll keep them spending money .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's that's good idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we've got good idea now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we meeting is needs to be wrapped up fairly quickly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we've got thirty minutes to start looking at the design in more detail .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we'll we will reconvene in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas more formalised .", "speaker": "A"}], "id": "xxxxx", "relations": [{"y": 1, "x": 0, "type": "Explanation"}]}]
