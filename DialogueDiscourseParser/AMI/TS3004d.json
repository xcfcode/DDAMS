, or wrote down .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we have to discuss about , if we give it one or seven .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you have ipod idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it quite beautiful .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's we are actu we are the flashy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the difference be between beautiful and fancy look-and-feel is the outside beautiful like the ipod .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and fancy's more like the flashing lights and the colours and that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we do if it's really , if you can if you can get the ipod look , then it's beautiful , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and what ki what basic colours were you thought of ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's black .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the basic colours are black or green or yellow ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or you haven't thought about ho how do we make black and yellow .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "basic colours , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you didn't say .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "bit of yellow .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can black white , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do we have yellow light ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , not really , but it's possible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not yellow , but just bit of light yellow .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's , different colours .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like white , also ni or always .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and what colours should the buttons be ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because , so what number do we give beautiful ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is , the same as the cover .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but also the light behind it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but can you change those too , with the switch ?", "speaker": "C"},

"it's ju so subjective .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it it's at least it's lot better than current remote controls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just give it two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the fancy look-and-feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's about our flashing lights and the background lights from the buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we can change the colours , so that's really fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one more thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so slide panel ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are we changing or are they there backlights on the slide panel

"just only , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , that's how .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's very fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so i'll give it , and you can also choose your light , so it's one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we've done lot of detail in light , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ye , this it is one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is difficult one , because we
