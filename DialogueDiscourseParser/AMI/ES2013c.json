[{"edus": [{"text": "just carry on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "alright this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting , have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared drive at this point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we should each have presentation to make .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , which i'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there are the decisions we have to turn to , but we'll come back to them in minute after take us to the minutes of the previous meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as we remember , opened the meeting , the four of us were present , the meeting the first meeting's minutes were reviewed and approved .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "sarah , you presented marketing research report which rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds it has to be hand-held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly speech recognition .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then steph did second presentation that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "all of us with those things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "kate presented working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard that it should be simple mass-produced device , because of the twelve and half pence cost .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having docking place as selling point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the new requirements that it for be for t_v_ only and that it include the so slogan and colour of the corporate design be included .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the corporate image .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alternatively it would be manufacturer to enclose it with the t_v_ , but it still should meet those parameters .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that the function we was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "at that point we that sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what do the current ones sell for .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and was to type up these minutes and work on the final report .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is this fair presentation of what our last meeting was ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're ready to close that and go back to our that one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're up to the point of the go back .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the three presentations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're going to pull the plug on me and turn to sarah .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that alright with everybody else ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "especially since kate asked to be last .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "sarah , i'm if misspelled your name , didn't know whether it was s_a_r_a_ or s_a_r_h_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "respond to either .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you respond to whatever you get , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did you do your hit , there it is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first thing want to address is one of the points that florence brought up , which was current cost of the competition devices , similar to the ones that stephanie showed us and they're twenty to sixty euros , depending on branding .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "some of them that have higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that with the current price that we're searching for , we're within , even on the lower end , of the market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but i'm going to move on to more interesting more vibrant things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , investigated the remote control market in greater detail , and my the theme of what was to work on was trend watch .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and know that you all are distance from cutting edge marketing research , so , i'm just gonna try to cloak it in really professional terms here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so spent on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what's hot , fruit and veg .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and this is all over the catwalks , paris , milan , and i'm talking about clothing , furniture , shoes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is really interesting change from past years , because it is much more organic , some would say approachable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if we're to refashion our view of what we want in remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into simple handset .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "also did little research on what again are the most important priorities in decision making about purchasing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "functional is out .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the fancy , and that's exactly the term , i'm thinking polished , elegant , innovative , but cut above .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is twice as important as the next finding , which is technologically innovative .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is interesting , 'cause in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important , but what's innovative is having it simple with technologically superior fabrics or , designed in interesting substances .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ease of use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "again , pretty low , it's the top three , but each of the fancy and technologically innovative are far more important .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in series of fruit themed sleeves .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's good idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it sounds like the covers that they use for the remote , your cell phone .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was thinking though that instead of having something like patterned , so , something similar to summer dress .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they could be ini initially we could start with fruit that would suit long hand-held , so banana , pineapple and pear .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it could actually the sleeve could take up lot of the development and the remote control , we'd just need to get reductionist on it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they could be interchangeable , they're spongy , that goes back to ergonomic , and the youngsters love , fun for the whole family , everyone can have their own .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what we're talking about is changing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "everyone has t_v_ remote , but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's what's hot on the catwalks .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , this is my this is what i'm thinking .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in most families , don't isn't the remote is remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but what this would allow is perhaps person in the family who had the most opinion about it we all need remote , but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , i'm thinking the teenager , the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so when your dad's sitting there , overriding your decision , going no we're gonna watch this , you can bring out your own remote and be like zap , no we're gonna watch this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "actually some households do have three and four t_v_s and they would have remote for each one , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is an idea and , this is exactly what the research has shown .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so really open this up to any other feedback .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this spongy fruit and veg .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "spongy is gonna be difficult , i'm afraid .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and as for budgeting as , if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable components .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have my ear to the market , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is this to the market ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "suppose rubber is the closest to spongy , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is spongiest , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that would add .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was thinking titanium myself .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was thinking titanium , was thinking it's just have been influenced by pictures of ipods , and they're also minimalist and shiny .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they are and they would fulfil the first priority , which is fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "many of us would associate those with fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "something else we could do is call it something that's fruit and veg oriented .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could call it the name .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are we talking about the device itself or the or cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as separate product ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would be very simple product that would have spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management and perhaps go to another group to actually design as separate product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that , that might be and then we could keep it titanium .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's pointless , isn't it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would that be agreeable ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would it be helpful if described the components bit , because it would give you bring this discussion back to earth of what we can actually physically do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or possibly it might be more useful if kate went next .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you wanna be next or you want kate to go next ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll move the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can even have them in different flavours as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote , it could be like pear flavour , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "scratchy was really thinking lot about the imac gel gem tone .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "scratch and sniff .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's hot on the streets , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "some of this you're gonna be little disappointed with some of the things have to tell you , but i'm afraid this is the real world .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so i've been looking at the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate , and i've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division , who have told me what's actually available , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they've got , but i'm not that it's quite what you want .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now this isn't very good overhead , but this is just to show you , this is the innards of remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "really need pen but does my mouse work ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can you see my little mouse pointer ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is the remote that's been opened up and that's the back of the interface .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and this is push-button one , so you see these little buttons here , they're little rubber buttons that go through onto the board at the back and they push these buttons here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we that's the basic construction that we've got to accommodate .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we got to have something that pushes the little buttons that talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the message to the receiver .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so wan wanna go through not just addressing the points that you made , sarah , but doing my presentation in the order wrote it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so first of all wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can have your bog standard double batteries in replaceable little compartment .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can have hand wind-up , which is quite an interesting concept for remote control , but it is doesn't quite go with the fruit and veg .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one that is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source , where you actually get the energy by moving the device , which is quite ni and neat one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "remember , we only have forty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have to it means that if it's sitting there for long time it probably won't work , but you have to throw it between your hands every now and then , it'll work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or we had talked about solar power , but thing that we that that's not so good in the dark .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now i'm afraid this is the options we've got on the case .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it can be made of plastic , rubber , wood if you like , or titanium .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there is rubber , but i'm gonna come back to the advantages of titanium , and it can have flat surface , curved surface or double curved surface , but if we wanna use standard components , we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what does the interface look like ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "push button , that's the one we're all familiar with .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can have scroll buttons and the scroll button can incorporate push , so you can have it like on mouse where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel like that and push to select something .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can have multiple scroll buttons , this is getting little bit complicated , but it's it the technology is there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we can also incorporate an display in the remote , but this will increase the cost .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the electronics that actually makes the device work , we've got three , simple , regular , advanced , and the price goes up as we choose each of this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we want the cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "all the other fancy interface designs go out the window , i'm afraid .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "pay little bit more for regular chip and you can have scroll buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you want the advanced chip it costs more , but it that's what you need if you want the display .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed sample sensor sample speaker devices .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now what that is , but they t's quite important and we might want to incorporate it somewhere .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ou our real expertise is in push buttons , have to say , but you think that's old technology .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we've got two options .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can either go for really cheap model , keep all of the costs down , which means flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or we can have something that looks bit nicer , it , won't necessarily look like pineapple , but that may or may not be good thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it could have an screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons , and it could have the company's new development of the sample sensor and speaker .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that sounds good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "any idea you mentioned that there would be cost difference .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you have any idea if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve euros fifty ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm afraid don't have that information available .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "manufacturing didn't actually give attach any prices to any of this , i'm afraid .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because , what , i'm being quite serious when say that the things mentioned are hot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the important thing might be to choose one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if what you're telling me is some of these things aren't just aren't feasible , we could something about naming , we could call it , blackberry .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's alright , let's see then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company , so what had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with logo on it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the real reaction company .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's just what i'd understood we'd be doing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's before heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit-wise .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , i'm trying to streamline mine little bit .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could do double curved rubber one , which would allow say banana , but unfortunately see from my notes that if we do that , we have to have push button as the interface , we can't do anything fancier .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "shall we 'til i've showed you what , my extensive presentation on what interfaces are available .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you did seem to include just in more detail what i've got though .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so mine's bit pointless .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "f_n_ and eight , did you say ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't have it on mine though .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "florence resolved it by eight again .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you do f_n_ eight again , it's it'll it , you will do an .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do it again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "keep doing it until you get it in both you get it there , you get it yours without that one , and then you get it with both .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should do it again ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this time it should come up both .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't actually have huge amount of different information then what kate says , just that my method was to look at the , my inspirations , which was big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use similar thing , including m_p_ three players , like , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "having think about the feature of ea the features of each ones , what functions we actually need , and then how to group and arrange these on the actual plastic or rubber hand-held piece .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've been especially interested in the ipod style scroll wheel , which , couldn't find the picture of the ipod only linked to web browser , so couldn't copy and paste it , but it had similar thing to this thing on the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it has scroll wheels without display , but they scroll like computer mouse .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so was thinking that really simple interface with just couple of scroll things on it and then instead of display the display could appear on the television screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like an existing sky or cable one does .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like , you press enter and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment , and you can do you can scroll along and it'll show you what's on in the next half hour , and you scroll up and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching the same channel on the screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but i'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote , which is really and fun and good to hold and , big , easy buttons to press , but still quite simple and quite cost effective .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what seems ideal for me would be to just have fairly simple , not fancy but not minimalist , just pretty simple plastic , probably , was thinking , yellow and black , just because that's the company's colours , with very few buttons , but that would correspond to screen that would appear on the television screen , like , just small along the bottom instead of having the ipod style display screen on the actual remotes , which is far too expensive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and when you've got screen sitting there in front of you , you might as have it appearing on the screen in front of you , it doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so on that you can , just much in the same way as an existing sky remote , scroll along , scroll up and down .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'd certainly support that idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and definitely support the use of plastic and or rubber .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "titanium would be , but it might be bit too expensive and too kinda spacey .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we're trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic , then titanium's too futuristic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as , we can't have double curved case in titanium unfortunately .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "whereas plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then and it's little bit pointless as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the having the screen on the television screen is good idea , 'cause otherwise we're putting up the price not only for putting building the in , but for the electronics as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like when you've got when you've got the screen there , it doesn't have to be anything fancy , just little menu showing , menu , you go into one menu and then it can have your different options , whether you wanna change the settings or the , your information about programme that's on at the moment .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there is that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't think that's to taxing to engineer .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but as for actually arranging them let me go back to the picture of the kiddie one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and quite like it , 'cause it's just smooth and hand-held and it's got these easily reachable buttons that quite nicely spaced out , so something bit like that with buttons arranged in circle .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "up , down , left , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you want scroll buttons in that as ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was thinking not actually scroll , like mouse scroll , but , 't quite describe it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you see on the one on the , down at the bottom , is the mouse .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "see where the mouse is , like this style thing where you have up , down , left and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and enter in the middle , so you pick your menu and then your different options and when you click on each one , it you can go into new menu for that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm getting bit specific here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "really we'd have to use something to show you , but if don't think get it up on the screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's clean design , it's playing to our strengths which are in push button technology .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to make it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "here we go .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the ipod spinning wheel is really complicated .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it does scroll , but it is hugely complicated .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what else have we got ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "them , they're terrible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but they all have this feature of this it's not quite scroll wheel , but it's selection in this circle , which is really good idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's selection wheel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we can implement it with simple push buttons , which is much cheaper .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like up , down , left and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which is good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then , so either channel up and down , volume up and down , next appearing programmes up and down , and then also when you get into the different menus on the screen , it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that's it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "look at this one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "almost impossible to misplace or lose .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you think with it seems that you are quite keen on the plastic , perhaps the something reminiscent of the child's remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "might take up your whole living room .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you think we could put it in fruit colour ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and have it abstract .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could call like fruit name , but it would be little more abstract .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that also is possible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather if you feel if you like the spongy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm just throwing out ideas .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just something else need to bring to your attention is have you seen these on remote ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or call it or call it banana and have it in yellow .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm thinking we need to be little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is actually the volume up and down , but they both say v_ on them , which , when you first look at it , you expect that to be the down , because it looks like downward pointing arrow , but it's actually the v_ to indicate that it's the volume , so we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we wouldn't have specific volume up and down .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we're having the scroll wheel , then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then , that's complicated .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wanna all for all your presentations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have about ten minutes left , in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you all have been self-stimulating of working together .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we need to come up with some specifics of the components , the materials , things like making the decision on the energy and the case and the interface type things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use , which the choices that we've discussed were battery , kinetic or solar .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is where kate's expertise comes in , and our decision making will be little bit guided by kate at this point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the you were saying that the kinetic would be useful , that is you just have to move it some and you'd be able to use it as opposed to battery that you have to either put it in recharger or keep replacing the batteries .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's dark day , that it'll die on you , and no way to do it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's the day you wanna use the t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what's our pleasure here , what would be the cost consequences of each of the three ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "unfortunately don't have costing information .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in terms of workability , the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic , but i'm don't figures on the difference in cost .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what's the feelings of the group on the kinetic ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i've used kinetic in terms of watches and it's very handy , you don't even notice that it's there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i've never come across it before , but it sounds fantastic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "sounds like it could be really good economical it would make the whole thing lot lighter , more convenient .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it could tie in with the fanciful design as , throw the banana , just gotta keep it moving .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause it's really quite attractive thought , isn't it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's like , good selling point .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's possible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it does depend how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and how much you do have to keep it moving , 'cause i'm conscious that watching t_v_ can be quite sed sedentary activity .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but could market that as was thinking actually cost saver down the road , in terms of battery , .",
