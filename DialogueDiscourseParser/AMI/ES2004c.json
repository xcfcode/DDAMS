{"text": "this is where we talk about properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we've touched on few things to do with that already , but we'll just go over it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the minutes from the last time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we had couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have decided on leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being flip design and different shape from what's normal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we were thinking shell , but something along those lines , just different shape from what's normal , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost , things like that , and our market was going to be young , business , range .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so shall we start with the first presentation ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes if you feel it's .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we just connect up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the methods we used to decide on current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional our usual market research study with hundred subjects and the general feedback from them is that the most im i'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , project manager .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we decided on the most important aspect required in remote control device and we'll come to that later .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that was one of the first things we did .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "also with our company being forerunners in putting fashion into technology , we also looked at fashion update using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the general findings from that was in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want fancy look and feel , rather than the current functional look and feel of remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they also want remote control to be technologically innovative , and , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the subject group we looked at .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , we found from our consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there also seems to be trend towards spongy feel to materials , again in contrast to last year .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "be interesting to see what our design people make of that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's start from the inside and work our way out .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's with me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "unless anyone has any questions about that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't , not yet .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that screwed in ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "hate those little things especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "first the into the method .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the t_v_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also in this study i've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "findings , i've got my little picture there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is the chip called the t_a_ double one eight three five which is what's used in every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and it's used for all t_v_ remotes at the moment .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then we we're loo looking into battery options .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's actually no rechargeable option available , so we saw the standard double and triple which we thought were bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , that might be bit silly to be honest , people won't it's like wind-up radio .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wa can you explain that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you wind up your remote control before you use it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how what how long can you get out of that , can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it might you , presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long , but don't t's really necessary when you think of the next two options , like the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when you got t_v_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or that doesn't count though does it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "does light charge as sunlight does ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it was u_v_ like any , any i'm pretty that solar is from the sun .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "alright it would the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need physical handle to wind up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "has to be solar .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we have to take into consideration size also , so standard triple might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't counts electric lights no , but not many you don't want to limit your market .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "artificial light , no .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's going to know , different parts of the world too , if we're marketing internationally .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "people who live in basement flats there's not that many people , but there are people .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but and most people also watch t_v_ in the night anyway .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then it would be charging through the day , the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the next one's the best anyway .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the kinetic charging which is like you get it in you get it in wrist watches and you don't even notice it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've seen but then if you think about watch , it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time so you're walking around , you're doing things , it is moving lot of the time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would charge it up , don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and are these like what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's it charges into some form of it's smaller cell which it charges into and the si the size watch battery , 'cause they use them quite frequently in watches .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that'll that would last for do i'm not entirely how long it would last but i've never seen one run out .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we solar would be slightly expensives .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and but then again it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it's only tiny amount it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you'd you switch the t_v_ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it really gonna be enough ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and for the same reason , you're only using it for incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it and you put it no do don't think the draw on it would be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's not the draw on it isn't .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "could ask referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with standard batteries ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "could people put standard batteries in but with they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging or the two things not compatible ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ye you could have dual power thing but the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because , if you lie on calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all look identical .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that affects the exterior design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they're expensive , they don't the normal batteries would be the cheapest i'd presume then it would actually be the solar charging ones , but the it's they're not very resistant to dropping , 'cause if you drop if you have the size you'd need to charge remote wouldn't be that big but if remotes always get thrown around and , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what price are we looking at for presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's twelve point another question is like .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they're not designed practical-wise .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "calculators you don't really throw around lot whereas remotes you do , they can they do , they they've got dual things , but they're the batteries are smaller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you do get bit of wear but don't calculators have battery in them as ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "again it de .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which one would last the longest , because we don't want customers to be like charging like mobile phone every day .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "remote control , like , so we have to look at the life also .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the if you had something du using the standard batteries and the solar charging , don't think you'd the it would how long the standard double a_s would last in or triple a_s would last .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it would just detract from the attractiveness of the whole feature , it's not gonna add anything , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it would , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can we add in an attachment to closing feature ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can we think about that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's add it in to think about because , where am ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because personally , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do we're doing something original and different but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you wouldn't lose it so much .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but then that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than the eternal battle for control of the controls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's not something that's come up in any of our focus groups and market research , it's not thing that people are looking for when we threw it open to the field .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's something to put on the side to think about .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'ll move on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "my second part of my findings the mo most current remotes use this silicone p_c_b_ board which pr printed circuit board , which has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit and each switch is connected to two different legs on the chip and so sends different message and that then gets translated by the chip into code and then it's fired out of this l_e_d_ in the sequence of on and off bursts .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what things do we have to consider there ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can we what size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ll this the thi the thing about is they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can print circuit board like that it's simply spaced like that so you can have fit the size of the nine buttons in .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you see how thin the tracks are , you could put them virtually next to each other and have much smaller switch on each one , if you wanted to but the there is an option to do it like that , or you could have some array of switches which i'll speak about in the next bit so that and then to , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in standby mode no while not being used .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now what was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see wh the buttons are , like on mobile phone , they do it more often than on t_v_ remote , but you could have lights behind the buttons and after like five or ten seconds of not being used i'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the case material , i've been sent what the factory can actually give us , the there's the plastic which we were gonna go for anyway as the main case housing and the main problems with the you could go for wood but it would be bit impractical .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "titanium very expensive just to process , which to make it is expensive , and rubber , you're saying that people like this spongy feel this year , so perhaps some something made of rubber , but was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they've said that they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti r_s_i_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm no i'm not how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the problem with the casing is that there's quite few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you go for titanium they can only do standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can be little more they can do curved shapes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units for the flip phone .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "second thing is and second question is like , mobile you can change the cover , you call it skin or whatever .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so in this case if you're looking at like customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so is that feature available in like titanium , or it's like only specific to plastic or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in titanium don't would be available really , the ju just it you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is it's light and strong but it should be left for aircraft design rather than for remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it does mark quite easily too if you let it fall .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i've got mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like rubber cover that goes over , that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to have different fasciae for the phone .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and you can peel them off .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber , like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can pull that off .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like rubber sleeve almost , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "something like alright .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that could be good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it could it would be comfortable to hold on also .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy new one if they want to .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's been really popular with mobile phones so don't see why not .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "also the just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , the kno we were planning to do some touch screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now what was saying before about instead of having you could have just bare p_c_b_ circuit board and i'm you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection over if you had them close enough , that would be one option .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the second option they offer rubber buttons , but that an type of screen 'cause one they're incredibly thin and don't take up much space , two they you can have them in array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in set thing and you could have them like touch display .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "didn't get the last part , you're talking of just what you said didn't get the meaning of it completely , you're saying like .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what on the screen you could becau you could fit it the problem with it is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve curved things with it , but you can you wouldn't have with the you'd have the wires coming off , you wouldn't have that with the , you'd only have that with the printed circuit board .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "with also with the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't to interrupt , don't see why the curved thing is problem , if we had shell , once we open that , so it'd be , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it would be flat inside .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you could have flat screen inside , but i'm just wondering whether we want an screen inside .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have misunderstood you ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it wouldn't be like full colour , it would just be black and white , but there'd be touch buttons , so you wouldn't be pressing down on , or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-r_s_i_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it would be good to have contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press , like one of the palm pop thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "hadn't really thought of that to be honest .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "had another idea , if it helps with that , but just to do with the r_s_i_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like small pointer thing when people want to .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you could , you could have some stylus that you could pull out but they could get bit easily lost , 'cause had .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for somebody who very often , if he would person who switches channels very often or does use particular function very often will find it very irritating to use and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they're easy to replace as , cheap .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it would have to be attached .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just thought they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got , couldn't they ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "pencil or pen , so they wouldn't really need .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we'll talk about that so if you finish your and we'll come back to that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's that that's the end of my .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's you , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and just one small question before like you are , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having flip-top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would be fairly simple , you'd actually have two separate you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , 'cause in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it applies to both our designers here , so i'm not how it would fit in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we flip open , now how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , you seen those ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and they respond to the turn of your body .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's little compact mirror and when you press button it then goes onto the phone display the remote control display thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're marketing to as much as we are to women .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they don't look at themselves ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "t's remote control , you were sitting watching t_v_ are you gonna want to open it and say shit should go and have shower and do my hair before put the t_ , no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you mean , it's with us using the ideas for mobile ph it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones kinda got sidetracked onto that , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much but we'll leave that one on the side .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can you could do it , you could have 'cause if you just put the full charge through an display it'll completely blank it out , but if you could get any mirror effect on it , i'm not about .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "forget about the mirror that was just very quick passing thought .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would like to share something which did here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first thing is on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous designs here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and second thing is there's too much of confusion here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no particular remote is standard .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like , some people have here you see this ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is on found that only common feature is the ch channel control and volume control , rest other buttons , they are in very disorganized and they are not consistent with other models and all .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and second as already discussed with william , we are going to have g_u_i_ interface in the middle of the flip-top and graphic user interface which is what we do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , which is like you have on icons you have is good example of g_u_i_ graphic user interface .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what does that stand for ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so not point or click press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and on the top repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so he need not use pointer to keep changing the channel if person is frequent surfer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we are having combination of boards , so on the simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can we swap that round so that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause if you're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like mobile phone .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no you'd hold it you don't if you flip it open then you'd be wouldn't you ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "isn't that the idea ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you've got your display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you can do it with your thumb li .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's what was just saying , and then have the and then have the at the top and then be able to touch that for the other controls , so have the volume and the programme , things like that , on the lower side .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you mean to the and the lower distance .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the findings are too many cluttered buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "repetition of certain but buttons which already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "all are confusing and in inconsistent .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we had latest finding of voice recognition , there was mail which mentions that our division has developed new speech recognition feature .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to check into the for financial feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at low cost , but for like we had response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers am here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "some thing or it gives bleep sound or some sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more you can say trendy also ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and technologically innovative also .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my personal preferences would be like , as already marketing department , they want something to do with fruit so wouldn't say the design should be like fruit , but we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , red chilli tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like , if you see the previous slide most of the users would now be acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we would not change that particular pattern because this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'t see that , is that play and stop and things ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is central one , the one you volume and channel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or is that volume and channel ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so keep that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models , if you look the models , it's here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this and voice recognition .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm not how long we've got left , but we need to make decision about the things we've discussed .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , we agree on do we agree on the battery ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that means that there's no function for li the port , that it sits in , then pressing the button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it is qui it's quite feature to have and also if they've got it if they've got these parts already in stock , then it won't be cheap to re-manufacture them , or it will be cheap to re-manufacture them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's bi it's like it's gadget , it's selling point .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so do you reckon that's good idea that , where's the remote , i'm here thing ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that would be quite fun .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , but we've used cheap relatively cheap and simple things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to t's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got black and white one , they use them in calculators so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the l_c_d_'s not cheap .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could start with the black and white .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that way we could upgrade later .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you could .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we talked about kinetic charging , we've deci seem to have decided on that , did we decide on double or triple batteries ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you want like back-up ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double or triple batteries 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no the kinetic ones come with watch battery that goes in watch .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", got you .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's lot smaller , so it would .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "got you on that , didn't realise .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we've got battery .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so there's not really decision to be made there , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the buttons what did you give us as our the bare-board or on the top one you've got the touch and then , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the were we're going for the on that one , on the buttons , on the top one we're gonna .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti-r_s_i_ ones .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "could you repeat that last part ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "on we've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gonna be the and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and for the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , it's fine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for the body design plastic , we could use the body , for the inside and rubber as padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for the inside .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we decided on rubber casing for the plastic shell , variety of designs , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it is just although it's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we're just going to go for vegetable and fruit colours , we're not gonna try and make it actually vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like shell that we discussed , just go for the colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no we don't wanna be tacky if we've got different shape anyway the fact the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it psychedelic , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , but that's not really what we're focusing on , what we're focusing on is the yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we could just pick anything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that going to be this image i've got in my head of something shaped like that , about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that's spongy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted , market research , is that fancy ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's just different it's just different from everything else and , i'm trying to imagine clean looking houses , beige and black so you either want something that goes with that , which is what's on the market anyway , or you want something that contrasts as like you get clocks now that are more of talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm just pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else , but agree .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we looked at those remotes , they are anonymous , very similar looking things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this would definitely be different enough , wondered if anybody could come up with something even more the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be relatively cheap to produce , that if in year's time we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on , which is another beauty of it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and you would just have an across the you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes , you could just go so far with it , like puffer fish , you could just , you could take it wherever , so that's quite flexible thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can just .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "acupressure , you could talk of acupressures .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and finally the body should be retouchable , may ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside , it should be moulded it with the design in such way you can change it every time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with these rubber these rubberised ca not the actual plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we've got five minutes , or that might've been up for while .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so can recap sarah , for the decisions that we've made , kinetic charging , the watch-type batteries , display on the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's how far we've got , what else do we have to add to our decisions here ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fine , we were talking of voice recognition also because that we are not for how to look it remote control if it's lost .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , are we looking at voice ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , it was just , there was just cost issue with that , but it's good idea we just need to check on the cost , is that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or like william was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for , the whistle .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the whistle ones , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for whistle .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and incorporating the company logo ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "didn't mention this , but we'll be incorporating in the design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from your report , it's not just case of having little r_r_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it's our product don't they ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they do , but we can you could is , it is , you just address that with advertising .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's gonna be ours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it'll have logo on it just like everything , but everything else has logo on it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently but it does , without that so i'm not worried about that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "did we know at the last meeting we spoke about beeper , that was you talked about beeper for location , have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "depending on how we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into , so that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else , then it's worth thinking about .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "depending on the expense of it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they've got in stock , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we'll find out more about cost afterwards .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm going to wrap it up there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "got end meeting now message on my mo so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we've probably got it says , closing we have forty minutes so think we've probably got about that time before we come back .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you got to go through .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and how long that took .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we are
