us the various investigation they've done during previous hours .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll then take decision in concert and then we will define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , last time we decided to have simple interface .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we also decided to have wheel to change channel previous channel button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "channel digit buttons should be protected by plastic cover for the remote control to look very simple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have also button for volume , and to switch on off the t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have also the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no voice features .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so now we will have three presentations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the conceptual specification by industrial designer , the specification of the u_i_ by or u_i_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "abdul al-hasred is my name .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the last point is trend watching by market expert .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can start with industrial design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is the presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i_d_ you want ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "switch slide on your request .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "only have three slides , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "look at the just this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "on some web pages to find some documentation and remote control is , as mentioned previously , you just have very simple chip and the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using wheel control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so was looking for that chip , which is very standard , and looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we can change directly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the push button are usually extremely cheap , but have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we if we could just talk about that if we really need wheel sensor or if we can not if we could combine something with the push button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wheel sensor is fifty time the price of push button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but is it significant price on the whole remote control ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because we can afford up to twelve euros for the price of the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but don't think that we should talk about the design of the box also which needs some money .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so will this with including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be lower than twelve euros to produce ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you received something .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also have to say did you receive the email about the voice recognition ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that's all .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you we an email from the manufacturing division that they have voice recognition chip already developed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it says that ri now they just use it to record answers to particular questions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it could be it's possible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and could it be adapted ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "instead of recording the answers you can just record something simpler like command .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and there can recognize some commands and ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and , so if they already have it as chip then we could use it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can just listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it's , haven't written my personal references .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the want to mention the problem of the wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , and if we could reduce that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have already some good things with the backlight of the push button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have question about that actually .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what is the purpose of the light ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just to make something which is slightly more design that squarey box with rubber .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is but in the dark but is going to be always turned on , the light ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can easily find the button in the dark or so ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it will be turned on when the user move the remote control , no ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if you move it then you have it , you don't need to find it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can see the buttons better , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as soon as you thought to move the remote control you have the light .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you need another sensor for that , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no it's too expensive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't think that this is really expensive , but at the end this is plenty of unexpen very cheap devices but the bill starts to be first of all was thinking to have continuous light and you when you press the on button you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device , little bit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it can be battery consuming , no ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to have the light always on ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "will discuss that after the other presentations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so my one , it should be in the shared folder .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it was last time saw it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , just move to the next slide .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so want very simple , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the major idea , as simple as possible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so look at some current designs on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and let's look at two of them because even though they have many buttons they look quite simple .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and in our case we just reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also does it fit hand ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because it was your wrist problem with the usage .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this these remotes are quite big , so go to the next page , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , from the bottom or whatever is there , the numbers and then the top , until the ten also , this middle part , and on the left one is exactly the same .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's more or less how we would like it , with big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "these are the basic thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's only the central part .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , software we will build will look more or less the same as these two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "with more ergonomic design on the bottom part .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you have , that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it could be on the side , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because we don't have these input buttons and this other that they have .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that the plastic cover is not very good idea because you open it , it can break , you ca you can do various things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere bit out of the way .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that they're separate bit , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "will be down or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it's easy to press the other the big buttons , but , it's not that difficult to press the channel buttons either .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "alright , you won't .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "usually what have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with , like buttons for tuning the channels and like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that you want to protect bit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it's reasonable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , don't , this is just the wheel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we could use the some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we could just use one just wheel and user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the wheel will be good advantage over our competitors .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's worse to have more expense on that's that aspect .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the market researcher will tell us all about that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we can move to the is there any question ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for designer of user interface ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or we can move to the next part , and discuss afterwards ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so now the recent investigation we have done fo of the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the second aspect is that the remote control should be technological innovative .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the third most important aspect is to is that the co remote control should be easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , are things we are we have speak about before .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so you can go after .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and there is fashion watchers in paris and milan that have detected the following trends , fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , if our remote control have to be fruit form or vegetable form something like that , or and the material is expected to be spongy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "support an apple .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which material can be spongy , and if you .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is good also for .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wou we can certainly just put the electronics in spongy thing , it would work , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it is good also to have spongy material , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can throw it to the television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because it's robust .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's robust , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could say that if you throw it , you have sensor , and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when it takes shock .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "know that they do that for alarm clock also .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "an and this you can say that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you ca you can go before , yes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel , after is technological innovative , and after the easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's innovative to use the wheel because no one else has .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's why we have to keep that if it's possible .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's it makes it both easy and both innos innovative .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's good aspect and it should be kept .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how do we make it look is the question .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have to make it look like fruit or vegetable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "colour that remember some fruit , things like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what about and for look and feel , what about piece of ice , with blue l_e_d_ inside ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the obvious thing is banana , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "about pear , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the pear , is like that and it's easy to have in hand and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it's ergonomic as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the banana is also ergonomic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "pear like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or fruit like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can discuss that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is there anything you want to add ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is there any fruit that is spongy ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can have like pear is good , fit , or banana as you told .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "something like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that's not in the trend .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can make it it's not hard , the metal .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "spongy is good because it will be robust as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , we can keep the wheel because it's easy , it's innovative , even if the cost is bit higher , and we also have to find , so , fruit like pear or banana wit any others idea you have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what fr fruit would you like to control your t_v_ with ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "odi banana is also yellow so you can't lost your remote control then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "banana , it's idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because but you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that , but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control , and here you have push button to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "two of the button , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you don't have .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's good idea , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you can just have this curve , and you move your hand here to press the buttons and then you move on the other side .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you can have it on two sides and it'll be , no ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's good design and it's innovative as then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can keep the banana .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it will be very easy to find .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can put also vibrator inside .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and everybody knows what is banana .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you start with fancy fruits and fra and tha , so we will just use standard battery ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's really good point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "hope the students of management die , but anyway .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now who are recording this meeting ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it so one second .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we have to take some decision on this aspect .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , so for , for component , so we have to think about those aspects , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the chip we chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what do you mean by case ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for me if we use spongy banana case , doesn't matter .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "want to have so something to prin to fix my components onto that box , and that's it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that can be in inside in the structure .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to if it's spongy then it's going to move , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , it's going to be bend lot .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if we try to push the buttons , it you t's possible ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no it's possible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but no the button would be it should be something odd shaped , with spongy cover .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is like the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "odd shape with spongy cover .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and standard battery , chip imprint , there's no specific problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we agree to put the wheel so it have to it has to be symmetrical .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wheel on the top .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "button , where do we want some buttons ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "usually hold , we want it to be good also for the left-hand users , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "sa let's say that it has to be you can only take two sides , one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is also the thumb .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or you could use this one , but if it's very comfortable , to use this one for the wheel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the thumb is more comfortable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this for the wheel and then this for the buttons ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's for both and left .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should have the two sides .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if the left , we have the op wheel buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can turn it this way also .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can do both with both hands .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around , the buttons are on the other side .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you cannot see them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you will get used to it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and moreover , the button ar are lighted so you immediately identify the side , because you have light on buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be know , but if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no you will use it only on the or left hand , whether you are righty or lefty .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for lefty it's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do this movement , and for righty as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this doesn't change that much .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , for interface we said also that we have this banana shape with button on the side .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and wheel on the top .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the colour is yellow .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's we defined everything according to what we should what the decision we should take , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can work on those aspects until next meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so have the final look and feel design according to the decision .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and have the user interface design and then evaluate the prodyuc the product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that is to say , check if it fit the requirement given by the users , but according to your presentation it seems to be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it seems to be fancy , innovative , and easy to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so to prepare the prototype would suggest that the industrial designer and the user interface designer work together .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would be better , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so you will receive further instruction by emails , as usual .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so do you need to add anything ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you feel free to express what you want to say ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you don't feel too constrained ?", "speaker": "A"},
