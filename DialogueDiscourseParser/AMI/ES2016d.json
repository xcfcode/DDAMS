meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we looked at the trends .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we had the fashion trends that people want fancy look-and-feel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it was twice as important as anything else .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and spongy feel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they wanted limited buttons and simplicity .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we looked at the method for coming up with our own remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "looking at other devices .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the ipod , we really liked the look of that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we also had the kid's remote for simple idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "two part remote , which was what were originally looking at .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then there was talk of spee speech recognition becoming more predominant and easier to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we've still decided not to go with that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we looked at the components the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , and made decision on what we were going to use to make our remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and how , what were making for the prototype .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'm going to leave it at that and let you take over .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the prototype discussion .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you need this ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there is our remo the banana .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can try to plug that in there but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we st went with the colour yellow .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "working on the principle of fruit which was mentioned , it's designed around banana .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it would be held in such fashion , where it is , it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "these would be like the rubber , the rubber grips .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have to use your imagination little bit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and this here represents the screen , where you , where you'd go through .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the simplest functions would be almost identical to an ipod , where that one way ch through channels , that way other way through channels .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "volume up and down .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's that simple .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that just represents the infrared beam .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's simple on and off switch .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we could use the voice .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that blue bits should be yellow , that that'd be where the batteries would be suppose .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that's about it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's as simple as you , we could make it really .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is there anything you want to add ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's what we have there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "plastic covered with rubber .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we might add some more underneath here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "give it , give it form .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you're supposed to hold it like that , but just if you grab it , take it from somewhere , so , you have some rub .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "doesn't make much difference .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you could work left-handed or right-handed suppose .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "exactly , use both .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "might as think about the button as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the actual thing might be smaller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like either put either one on either side or not do it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what but what's that button ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just the on and off .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's quick on-off button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's it's pretty important .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you don't have to fiddle with that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's not i'd say bit smaller would probably be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you wanna play with that over there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's flimsy 'cause it's made out of heavy play-doh , but and whether or not it would fall into the cost everything suppose .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would you like to done .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with the scroll and the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "luckily we are going to find out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or not luckily .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you have marketing presentation for us .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so first i'll just discuss some of the criteria that found .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just based on the past trend reports that was looking at earlier .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then we'll do group evaluation of the prototype .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then we will calculate the average score to see how we did .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we're gonna be doing it based on seven point scale .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "with seven being false , we did not achieve that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's definitely different than anything else out there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if they think that what is out there is ugly , then yes would say , would say most definitely .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it still has your traditional black .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not there's no sharp angles to it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and , yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "however the colour , we don't have say in that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the colours detract little bit .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "some people might say it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that has been , that has been dictated by the company .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so to answer that honestly would rather say like , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'s nothing you can say about that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "something more modern to go modern colour to go with the modern form .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you don't want your three feet huge dis display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , do you think , since we this was sign criteria , do you think we should put it somewhere in the middle then ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "does that sound good ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what do you think ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would say four .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "four is fair .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "very non-committal , four .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the second one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "did we make it simple for new users ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's very intuitive , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that was the main aim , one of the main aims that we had .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "give it one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'd say that so one ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause we've brought it down to four controls most common , which are channel and volume .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then the other ones are just matter of just going , just scrolling further .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "scrolling through and selecting few .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the fourth one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how about the problem of remote being easily lost ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one of the number one complaints .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "whether you want to or not , you're not gonna lose it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's bright yellow .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "bright yellow's hard to lose .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that , we could just use that solely for the finding thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that was what we'd mentioned .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could and it is quite bright and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just to use , to find it when it was lost .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but like said , like don't think you'd lose something so yellow so easily .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it's not gonna fall , like rectangle would slip down behind things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's gonna be difficult shape to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in the middle again , three or four ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose , million ways .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can pick it up and walk away with it and then you've lost it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if we do go with the , with the speech recognition , then it , then our scale goes up quite bit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we eliminate the fact that it's impossible to guarantee that it's not gonna be lost then i'd say two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with the speech recognition , which may be changed depending on budget .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you could add an extra feature actually .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could add that but that's nothing we have thought of so far .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which , which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just some proximity pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but just those whistling , clapping key rings you have .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's the it's based on this anti anti-theft technology for suitcases and , where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage , another piece that starts beeping .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it can't be that expensive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that can't cost much .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to hide , so you have one piece , you have to glue somewhere behind your stick it behind your t_v_ and the other .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "stick it on the t_v_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that'd be tough then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "also your remote would alarm you if somebody stole you your television , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "are we adding one of these two features ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's add one of those features and say yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we're back to one ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are we technologically innovative ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's all just it's all just stolen technology when it comes down to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'd say so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't get many mo remote controls with screens on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's stolen technology .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's but there's not lot of yellow , there's not lotta yellow .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we have .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but for remotes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "course that wasn't really we were kinda forced to take that colour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "fa 'cause it's stolen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but how many remotes do you see like this ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not so many .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we added the screaming factor then we go up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would say we're probably at four .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's gonna hurt us .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you have that , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have some spongy , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as much as needed , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's not one though .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one would be the whole thing to fold and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because it's only got what , these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side the bottom the underneath on the back .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's four at most .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "probably four at most .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and lastly , did we put the fashion in electronics ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "possibly even five .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'd say we did .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if your fashion is carmen miranda , you betcha .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "more the recent fashion is rather displayed in the and the way you operate it than the form and the colour , but it definitely is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "be what we were told , and they'd say , definitely .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now we just gotta calculate .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "six eight twelve sixteen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "seventeen divided by eight .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "seven is two point four ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that some long division ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "haven't done math in years .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just , i'm there's .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we'll say two point four two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how does that look ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'t do that without calculator .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no 't do long very impressive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's been while .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and what is the acceptable criteria ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is there like scale that we have to hit ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they just told me to pick my own criteria and have you evaluate it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now we get to do the budget numbers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you didn't know that you were gonna have budget .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you'd been going long time dividing that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "two point four two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we'll go with that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not too shabby .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so have here an .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "fifty percent , you're kidding .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's too much .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we want fifty percent profit on this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can't really see that very .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "charge about three hundred quid for it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "twelve and half euros is what supposed to cost us .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so let's see .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the wonder if make this what the it won't let me do that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright so at top , if you can read that or not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'t 'cause don't have my glasses on , but so we've got the energy source .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's four , five , six categories .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have energy source , electronics , case .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we have case material supplements , interface type , and then button supplements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so first of all energy source , we picked battery .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "probably some either two or four .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "at four it's gonna be too heavy , so that that's not our problem .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "people can change it every month .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they won't know until after they bought it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is consumerism .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright so for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chip-on-print , regular chip-on-print , advanced chip-on-print , sample sensor , sample speaker .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're advanced chip are we ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the advanced chip-on-print , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have one of those .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then the case is probably it's double curved .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "double curved , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "case materials are plastic .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's two , since one for the top , one for the bottom .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that or is it just one ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no that's just one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's one because of the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's just one mo single mould , we can do that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it doesn't matter 'cause the price on that one is zero , which is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's not special colour .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's specially ugly colour , but it's not special .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have pushbutton , scroll-wheel interface , integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton , and an display .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we actually have the display and then is it the integrated or is it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then i'd say the integrated .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we could make the buttons wood .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "say mahogany or so or titanium .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it'd look really lovely .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they cost us all the same .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just that's too much .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged , we shouldn't be charged anything for the button supplements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no that's getting bit tiny .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'd ignore that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "leave it blank .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're gonna leave that one blank because we run on and scroll .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so our total is fifteen point five .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which believe is by three euros over .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's hard to believe .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we'll go for the hand dynamo ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the only thing better than banana-shaped remote is one that you shake .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if it what if we completely took out the one single button we've got on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and just had scroll wheel interface .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the display .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "suppose the c_ display's the one that's pushing it up bit though .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause the 'cause we have to have both ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's face it , it also depends on the software on the television .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can have the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so let's take away the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you could take out the dis display even , if it comes up on the computer itsel on the t_v_ itself .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we may not need the display ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that is possible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we may not need it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "twelve point five .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we just remove our screen here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "make it bigger dial .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "easier to use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "even easier to use then .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "besides look at what the does to our lovely remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the so we can just take away heck of lot of the there you go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "back to the design room boys .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what's the blue part ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that was just we ran out of yellow .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the batteries .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "looks more like banana .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for all those fruit lovers out there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one more criteria .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the costs under twelve point five euro .",
