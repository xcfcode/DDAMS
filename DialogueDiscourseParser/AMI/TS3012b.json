start soon , we have now don't have much time anyway .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there he is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there you are , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "little bit of pl little problem with computer .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're about to start , so have seat .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "today , functional design phase .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll take you over the minutes of last meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that was just to get to know each other , have little thoughts on what your vision is and on this project , so put the minutes on the made on the project share , so if you wanna review them , they're there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "will do so after every meeting , so if you have some information you wanna take back you can find it there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "anyways , today three presentations , from every one of you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "after that got some new project requirements from project board , so we're gonna go af go after over this later .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but wanna start with you did first , so we can see what everybody came up with .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and after that we can have the new requirements and share some thoughts , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "who would like wanna go first ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", no problem .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there was little problem with my computer so not the whole presentation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "anyway , let's see what you have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and want to open the my no .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's still bit open .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you should close it on your own notebook , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , that's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the functional requirements , it's very important for the user , he wants to .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the method we used it it's not slide , because it went wrong , but the method we use , we tested it with hundred men , and we asked them to what the remote feel like and what what's important .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if cut in , is it people or men ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it people , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "both women and men , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause it was only men , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the findings seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , most they want to spend money for better system , for better remote control , so we can do little things with it , and they use , they use zap lot , fifty percent say they only so that's the most important things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's pretty shocking .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we have to we have to do something about that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not all of it is it on mine on my powerpoint presentation , but the relevant buttons are the power , the channel selection and the volume selection .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just talk ahead .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's the most basic buttons that user wants to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "less important is tel teletext , they use it , but it's not very important on the scale of zero to ten they six and half and but not important is the channel selection , the ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's little weird .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the no , that's very important , but and not important in the audio settings , display settings and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which channel selection ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can hide those under menu , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "beep to find your control , was that was in the test , the most people find it irritating when they cannot find rem their remote control , so it's bee beep to sound it and you can find it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's like button on your t_v_ ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and another thing they want was speech recognition so they can say what they want to let's go to channel one and that's things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and they want an screen to look it wh what's on every channel and what do want with it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we wanna have little preview on the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "preview what's on the channel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that manageable ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause it sounds pretty expensive too .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that sounds too it's possible , but it's expensive , but do continue .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my personal preferences is button for my favourite channel , so zap to my quick to my favourite channel wh what so , the remote mu must see or must see wha what mine preferences are for which channel , so zap to what ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you don't set it yourself , it just remembers the channel that you are on most , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you want the you want it to be programmed , programmed or you want it to recognise your favourite channel ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's see , you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel , so it recognises your favourite channel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's what my personal preference like .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's it does it recognise itself , you don't have to set it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , itself .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's easier to sell it , but it's manageable , but we will see .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's little bit it's the end of it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's little bit lost it , the computer crashed , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no problem , it's , that's , go ahead .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , some technical functions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have some issues which you discussed earlier .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let's just start with the method .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it sounds really easy , what does the user do , what does the remote control do , but there are quite some issues .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the things i'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect , because the technical aspect , that's covered .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can do that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what goes wrong at the user .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "gets the remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "where is the remote control ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we've all had it once , want to watch some television , where's the remote control ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that was one of your ideas which you posted in the network folder , really good idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that seems very good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "these are just the issues .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "come to some personal experience , findings , possible solutions later .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "searches for the button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there are many buttons on remote control which are not clear .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so either we lose those or we try to make it little bit more clear .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "also symbols tend to fade after while .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's nothing more annoying than faded symbols , because you which channel is this button , so possibly we could find something for that , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so have it more make it more durable actually .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , user presses the button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "usually when you have lot of buttons , buttons are small .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you press more once remote control goes kablouey like that , so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on the remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the buttons should be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and possibly also the size , so more important buttons , bigger si so this is what had in mind in the fade-proof symbols , locator , sound , so clear we should stick to existing symbols , but we could do little investigation to see whether some symbols are need to be replaced by others .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "make it make them bigger .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "even more durable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what we want to go to is not this one , but more less buttons , easy , some bigger buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's what had in mind .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is not the final design , this is just general idea of how i'd like to see the general idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "must say that it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that was it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that was it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that was good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we agree on the part that we need to get something on the remote to find it somewhere and increase it the durability of the thing , so the other aspects , we'll just see how what you came up with and what's possible for that budget .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's really good idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now work little with me .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let's start it as it is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are few questions that need to be answered , you already talked about it little bit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which buttons are wanted , is our remote control universal or should it be programmable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need something like mode that you can switch it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because then the buttons have to send out different signal then they would normally do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and how big is the remote control going to be ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll tell you why that's important to me .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are lot of technical parts in the remote control , so that's why also would like to say go little bit easy on the designs , heard ab you talking about beeps and about video screens , but the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so keep in mind that everything that you keep think of , it has to be built .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's that's not as easy as it might look like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "material study , i'm working on that for the costs .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have to check out how far go with that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "normally , circuit board is made of fibreglass and the wires are made of copper .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way , we can just go on with that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then i've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the more we can make at once in one piece , that is cheaper .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you mean integrate them all into the circuit board .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "exactly , so if we make circuit board with the connections already on it , then that's cheaper .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we have to make something that's not too difficult in design again .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is what look like looks like if you press one button , so this is not the entire thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have the power coming in , then you have like switch .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the switch if you press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over morse code , that's how you should see it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the morse code goes to the amplifier , then the signal is sent to two light bulbs .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have infrared and an interv how to say it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "light in indication , light that it's functioning .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "here again , that's my story about the different modes , if you do want to make remote universal , then the processor has to make up different morse code when some button is pressed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that makes it much more complex , so we really need to have look , do we want that or not .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't have any personal preferences so far , except for the materials to be used light , that they are light .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that was it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that was it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll get back to my thing then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "back this up to the screen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so got some new information on the project specifications are changing little .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like you said teletext is not very popular anymore because the internet , nowadays people don't use the teletext anymore or hardly , so it can either , don't think we should remove the button , because there are always people who are using it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but don't should be very it should be one of the big buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not important anymore .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're targeting young people now , because our this is new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people , which are the younger people were defined under forty .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's that's also good with the fashion and everything , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and they want to pay for it and with more where with more technical specifications in the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they want to pay for it , people are willing to spend money actually to buy remote that they like .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if they like the way it looks , the way it functions , so they're actually gonna spend money on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see how far we can go with it anyway , so and one thing that should be important is that the corporate colour and slogan are recognisable , which is black and yellow , but i'm not if we should keep the logo in mind , because with colours you can have lot of fashionable colours and everything on it , which suits everybody's taste .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so with that concept started thinking , so why not just steal nokia's idea and just make changeable covers for your those cost hardly anything , and people could even spend extra money on buying cover and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or we can sh we can make different basic design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and sell the covers separately , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's just little marketing idea that could be applied , so you can it appeals to really everyone .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you don't have to you don't have to make entire remote controls .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we make basic one and manufacture this cover separately .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so just i'm not if you came up with anything in the meantime , after making presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would you like to share ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , this is good idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but go ahead .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is it manageable ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "with an screen you can why ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is it easy ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we should lose the screen , like you said .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , so too .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's huge the is huge , it consumes batteries like hell .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it takes up lot of power .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it costs too much to fabricate , so we're on tight budget here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it costs lot , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what we could do , what could be possible , is not an screen but with preview , but i'm not if it's even possible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "little t_v_ guide .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like you have little just text only , not colour , just little text thing so you can use your remote as t_v_ guide .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm not it's even possible , but , make it , find little compromise in that , but what did write down ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have to check that out , i'm not .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the , the beep is very simple thing to imple implement , just make button on your t_v_ and just hit the button , it beeps somewhere .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that must be possible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's easy to implement , we should go for that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm , whe where do you wanna hit the t_ you wanna we want button on the television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it's just slap-on sticker with button which sends out small signal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "thin , where else should you put it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in , but that rules out universal remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because that's not possible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but how are you gonna use that if your remote control is lost , how are you gonna press where are you gonna press the button ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you mean as like separate thing you can attach to your t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that could be possible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "little box you can attach to your t_v_ is fine then , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then i'd like to know now if we want the universal remote control or not , because that's determines everything i'm gonna do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should go for universal , because we're separate company making separate remote controls to sell to lot of diverse people .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "universal remote control should be possible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "everyone wants to buy it , so we .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then go for that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we're targeting everyone , so remote , universal is good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , it's fine with me , but then to look for .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "speech recognition , it's very hard , because we're selling across multiple countries .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so implementing speech recognition is such small apparatus , it's very hard to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or when you say one two it it's enough , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it's besides that , the technology isn't really super yet , so that is problem in implementing this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but don't see arabian people speaking one , two whatever .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not mature technology , it takes lot of memory and everything in remote control , so don't should be implemented in remote control yet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's good idea , but it's just not don't think the market's ripe for that yet .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what else do we have ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the symbols won't fade , little harder plastic or especially li we don't have to do all the buttons , but especially the ones that are the popular buttons , so those always fade first .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "already noted that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the thing is the most important things that we have now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we make remote control with changeable covers , then we can also make cover for every language area .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's fo is especially for older people , that they can read it in their own language .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we're not targeting older people , we should remember that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "everything we target is under forty , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you assume that they read correctly and they're the most important thing about young people is that they're really sensitive to trends that are passing through the world , so no , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves or just the that's problem with the text then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , it's just something you put over them , because we , you ca , tha that's not bad that's not even it's not even bad idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", if you're into the durability issue you could , if your buttons are faded , after if you make durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy new cover .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm not it's hard to make .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but know that the buttons are like nokia telephone on one sleeve , so you don't have to change your whole cover .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's good and bad idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it works the same as nokia telephone , it's in my .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "know , it's just one piece of rubber , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's what something have to look into .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "either change both the buttons and the cover or just the cover , i'm not which is easier , so anyway , this is what we're gonna do afterwards , just lunch break and have more individual work after that , so let's see what we let's see we so you have to come up with components concept , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "want some you should do some trend-watching , because even if we're gonna do those covers and everything , what people really want , that's what we need to this phase , because that's gonna be the essential final design that we're gonna come up with .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "user interface is fairly obvious .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it should be very intuitive , it should speak for itself .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "bought remote control last week with new t_v_ , it was it it's like all buttons and you have no idea what it does at first , and i'm total t_v_ new , anyway .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it should be have less or very little buttons and second level menu for the advanced things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or just stick under menu , like you said the sound options and the surround and whatever , they're more complicated , just stick under one menu and give it just put it in software piece , you can menu and you can select everything you want to set on your t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it techni technically possible to send signal to television and then pops up menu , because we're working with different types of television , so we're going to work with that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that is true .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , that's true .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , don't .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because the television needs to respond to the signal , and if it doesn't know how , it's exactly , that's not possible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's an in-built menu , isn't it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we or we could use double-sided for less used functions you , with the cover .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm not if it's impossible , but there's chance it's not , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "double-sided remote control ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't think that's useful .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's an idea to overcome these issues , because no , but basic functions but functions which are not frequently used .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but then you're gonna have lot of wasted buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have sony t_v_ and the half of the buttons won't function if you have for sony that won't for philips t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because if we use universal remote control , we're going to have most buttons on it , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't think we should , for exam i'm not , for ex you have to make it little decision between the part if you want universal remote control that it should do what people usually do with their t_v_s , not the very complicated settings that you can usually do that with either old remote control if they really hate that thing , but you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of t_v_s .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that might be broken .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's there is standard between because usually the menu is the menu button is usable between different brands .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "especially the big ones , the big brands , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause everybody have universal remote control and it can use the menu button , so i'm not , if you can put some research into that , if it's possible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just and the navigation is very basic , it's usually the same thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but there must be way to invoke the more complicated functions of television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours , then you should be able to get everything out of the television that's in it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because otherwise you'll lose functions by buying our , thi so too .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we need to put some research into that if we can open the menu , it's possible , just the way how to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then you could do everything suppose , because usually the t_v_s have tha that inside in this other little piece of software , so it's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that our remote control should not look like any other .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices , and you always grab the wrong one because formatting of the buttons is exactly the same , only the labels are different .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it should be little distinct from everything else , because it's either it's both mayb the shape can be little different .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we should not do that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have some ideas .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have some ideas .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's little more curves or whatever .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's your division .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and with different colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll put some on paper and present them next time the ideas that have .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not what because we have forty minutes , i'm not how much time we have left for the meeting anyway , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "heard beep go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it wasn't me , it was him closing something .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so anyway , we could do some work now on the design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what do you want , do you want , but , may something like this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we like some curves or .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but though smooth inside .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you have the transmitter here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's see that you what would be handy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that the buttons should be the channel buttons should be on their own .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and light volume .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's see one , two damn it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we get the general ideas , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "another one here .", "speaker": "A"},

up channel down and volume .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "t's like this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "withi within the , just take it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you have the up channel the

"it's fine , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is what people are accustomed to , so , but this is just general idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the menu button can go in the middle .",

at it , because it might be very good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because if it's useful to have it rechargeable , but at the same time , if you don't want recha if you forgot to recharge it

isn't that too expensive ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries , docking station and do people actually want that ?", "speaker": "B"},

not if there's information available on this , but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's just an idea , we have to find out if it's possible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , they want to pay for it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do they want but they want rechargeable one ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm not , you should find out if it's if rechargeable is important .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there was not el ask esque but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these are comfort issues .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so people will pay they wanted to pay for comfort .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is comfort .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they want to pay for comfort , we just assu we could either make

.", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so let's go through the covers is good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like the covers .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's brilliant idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can we save this or .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "never thought hope if have information about that , i'm gonna .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's we can save this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "up and saved .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we even saved the ant .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what we have is you have to do lot of work on if it's possible for the cost .", "speaker": "A"},
