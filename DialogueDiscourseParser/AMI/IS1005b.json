[{"edus": [{"text": "so to see you again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "tod for this meeting will take the notes and do the minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we will see our three presentations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we will start with the manager expert wi who will talk about user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can have the laptop over here , or ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you have to come here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have to get up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it should stay .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should stay in the square here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'm gonna present some findings of study we conducted into what users want in this remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can put it here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's , it's jus .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so first of all we what we did is we conducted an experiment with hundred test subjects .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we put them in our usability laboratory and got them to , play with remote controls , and also to complete , after they'd done that , to complete questionnaire to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the major things we found out was that users don't like the look and feel of most remote controls that are currently on the market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they , seventy five percent of the people we did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user , that is , the way users use remote controls when they're watching t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that the layout of the remote controls didn't match they way that they used it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and thirdly they say that half of the users that we tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that are on remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics based on how these test subjects were using their remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and from this we came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and you can see they're used hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , while the user's watching t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the closest button that was used , the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button , which was used fourteen times per hour , followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , all the other , all the other buttons , such as ch audio and picture selection configuration buttons and things were used , approx less than or equal to one times per hour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we also asked users which buttons had the most importance to them , which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and they came they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having very high relevance .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the audio and picture settings had very that the users thought that the audio and picture settings were very weren't very important to them , and they used them very infrequently as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we asked users what frustrates them the most about current remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and fifty percent of the users said that what frustrates them is losing the remote control somewhere in the room and not being able to find it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they also said that it takes lot of time to learn new remote control , especially when there's many buttons and it's , unintuitive interface .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then thirdly , they some users commented on the fact that the way that you have to hold and press buttons on remote control ar are bad and repetitive strain injury .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we also asked some users about some specific features that they'd like to see in the on the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in particular , do they want an display , and secondly , do they think speech recognition is useful feature to have on remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "our findings are that amongst younger age groups the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they want these features , they want these high technology features .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "whereas the trend was as users became older and older they were less likely to want these features in remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it depends on where we're focusing our market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics , we're focusing on the younger target demographic , and so we should think about adding these high technology features into our remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's my dic that's my presentation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , now we can talk about user interface and about the technical function of this device .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so pet peter , can you talk say something about that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the user interface is responsible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you think i'm user interface manager .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if could go there with this cable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you're scaring me with man .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and speech recognition in remote unit , it will be very expensive .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's true , but , they're features that users want , so it's and our production cost of twelve fifty euros per unit is fairly high , so we can afford to add these features into our remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "at least we have couple of months to work on it so it will be cheaper finally .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it is true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "where's delete button ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the wrong one , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's still bob morris .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because you cancelled it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you should have put yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "click on yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so here is my presentation about technical function design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "will talk about different components and of system and how they react together .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", first what is remote control ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "simply it's device , as , for sending some commands by some waves to another device to tell different commands with this device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the main idea we don't use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it has different blocks , different blocks .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits making interface with keyboard and reading keyboard and reading the keyboard commands .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then inter then make these keyboard commands , in interpret these int keyboard commands .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then there should be an electronic circuit making electronic signals according to these commands and finally there is transmitter which is cord or diode making waves to transmit through the air and this air this wave will be received by the other device like television or whatever , to realise the command .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "about what found about different these different blocks are , usually there are two different methods to for designing remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they are based on infra-red waves or radio waves .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you still want me the presentation .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there are two different solutions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is this can be the differences the between different waves , infra-red or radio waves .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also as understood , and it was part of bob , presentation , people prefer to have the remote control with less button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so for the electronic part , working and interfacing , with button , we should try to design remote control having some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons to just to search between different options , and showing something on t_v_ and putting less lesser on the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and personal preferences , certainly remote control with working with radio waves is preferred because you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and again , using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred , as see .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that was my presentation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you think radio waves will interfere with other appliances in the home ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't , because we can make we ca we can make this wave in specific frequency .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so they can be in range which is not inter interfering with the with other devices inside the home .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so can we use any frequency ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it should be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have the to use any frequency ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no but as know , there is range for this , for designing this circuit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can tune our transmitter to work in this range , and for this range we don't need to ask any permission .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and what happen with radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so do they have the same frequency , or ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for this i'm not the solution , but one solution can be something like putting password inside the wave , so the only your t_v_ can understand it , identification code inside the password may simply or identification code may simply solve this problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "know about this , since it's my it's exactly my field , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's handshaking , when starting to when you start to communicate with the your t_v_ then it's like an handshaking protocol with your remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if two devices are trying to go to communicate with the t_v_ set then the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can be problem sometimes , but most of the time it works .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "specific remote control has specific .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we don't have to think about this because as function designer that we will use the already made circuits which we probably bu buy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's worth to buy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and they have these problems solved so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we don't have to think about these .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , you can talk about the function , and open .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have only couple of things because had struggled bit with the software that i'm supposed to use in this company .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was used to use linux before , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but tried to break through this too , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how to make it big ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it should work , so you can .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so will speak about working design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the first slide .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what have to do ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "look at what the other company so presently am looking what is possible to use , what circuits to use and like that because didn't work with these circuits so far so have to look what is available on the market for the communication for the i_r_ circuits and so on , so i'm currently looking what is available on the web .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and wanted to ask you afterwards , after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there , so , would be glad if you can tell me about them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "findings , that's the point that i'm working on currently but so far was looking what are the blue circuit , radio wave radio frequency circuits are available now , but the prices read are high .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , know that the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can make the t_v_ do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on , but , when you are not close to the t_v_ you probably won't need to change the program and so on and so am voting for to stick to the infra-red control instead of r_w_ but we will discuss it later .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "components to use , i'm not exactly what will use for the design of the circuit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it depends on whether we will use the and mainly the speech recognition , because the speech rec ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "are we planning to take an off the shelf an o_e_m_ component for the radio wave circuit , or are we planning to construct our own circuit board ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this we buy , because it's rather cheap nowadays and it's not worth to construct ourselves .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we just buy circuit board and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but i'm not about the circuit which is responsible for speech recognition .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this prefer that we should make ourselves .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it depends whether we take decision to use it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's fairly expensive to use these circuits .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , speech recognition , it's because it's common nowadays to use , so agree on using any , less buttons good for me as designer of the circuit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what do you think would be the price , it would be out of range ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or it would be feasible ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was not thinking too much about the price .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if we use the even the radio frequency communication with the t_v_ set and the backlight and related things like the photo diodes and , it should be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle but we'll see afterwards .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it depends of you if the m_e_ or u_i_d_ , i'm about the names , don't really know , want to have it like in metal or in plastic , these things , it depends on you not because the electronic device's price is not so big in comparison to the overall shape and like that , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we will discuss it afterwards .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is nothing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is just my notes on what to use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and my personal preference is yes , would like also preferably to use r_w_ circuit , but from the point of view of the design and price , would stick to i_r_s .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's my opinion .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if infra-red circuit not the radio frequency .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because it's simpler ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because the range where you can use it is fair .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the price is fairly cheap for this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's price matter .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "jus just the price .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "otherwise don't care what put there because it's the chip which buy or which we buy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what how much more expensive ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are we talking three times more expensive ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or ten times more expensive ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "three to five .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not ten times , but it depends what we .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's still lot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's probably not worth spending the extra money , because all the other remote controls on the market have infra-red , so people don't expect anything other than infra-red .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's not worth spending the extra money .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "on the other side , we want to have something new .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they are used to use it when they can see the t_v_ so , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "where we want to have something new and so we should still thinking about it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , based on my usability studies feel that users are prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above , the difference between infra-red or radio waves .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we're better off spending money in the usability phase .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you the user interface , and management man , that's it for me .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so have to inform you receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first , they say that's about something about teletext .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it becomes from according to them it becomes out of date .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and actually it's not useful to have teletext .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can avoid the teletext .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the second thing is they suggest that we should use the remote control only for t_v_ , not for d_v_d_ and other devices , because it make it makes it's too complex and because we have not much time for this project we should stay on t_v_ on the only specific t_v_ remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the third one is about the image of the company .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we should keep the product should be recognisable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's that mean we should use the colour of our company and put somewhere the slogan of the company , which is , we put fashion of in electronics .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , when people see the remote control , they should say it's from real reaction and he they should recognise the company .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , so now we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will have on this remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , are we going to use , speech recognition ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should we start with just the core , the basic functions that we need .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then we can move on to the more advanced features .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the available things are , the buttons and everything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "radio frequency depends .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , the recognition it depends on you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but first what is what are the usual function of standard remote control ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you should probably speak .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", the obvious one is changing channels .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we should stick on very useful functions , because we want less button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , turning channel , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just one note to the chan channel changing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do we will we use only two buttons , or like numbered buttons ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "those nine plus one or two ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it would be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "on the other side we have more and more channels , and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want , it's we could think of something more betweens , like .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we keep all these buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "at least nine , ten button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like ten plus , five plus , one plus , one minus .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "something like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or using the names and the keyboard .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could have key buttons , like discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and inside this thing you can move , switch .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you mean like hierarchical structure .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like categorising channels .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you want to see movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it just an idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what you think about that but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it requires the use of probably , to tell you , so i'll make note on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to have some feedback .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could also incorporate petre's idea of the slider for the volume , with the channel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we you could quickly just through many channels .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like roller for the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for the channels , perhaps .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we've got channel and volume .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we are still speaking about the common devices or we are inviting the new one ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the core functions we want , and then more advanced ones .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what about the settings of the t_v_ ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because it's button we don't use very often , but it's we need it anyway .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we don't have any we don't have we should just design the remote control and we sh we don't have any access to the t_v_ design or we can change some design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because one solution for this ch changing channels is to see summary of all channels , some preview of all channels and then you can .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on the screen , you mean ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not on the control , on the screen , on the t_v_ screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not on the control , but on the screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this would avoid , then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't , don't but don't think we're the ones .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this remote control we're developing is generic control for all t_v_s , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it's possible to watch something on t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it would be better to stick to the remote control and not to bother the t_v_ to print these things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wi it will be still more expensive , but for the and this is no problem in the price .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , what are we doing with the settings ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because settings if we want to do settings we need buttons for that and we want less buttons , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with the we can do something with less buttons , but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then you don't want to make the display too complicated at the same time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there's always we can always have these less often used functions hidden somewhere , under cover or at the back of under slide or some .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like ma we could have two buttons like simple mode and advanced mode .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or like children and grandfather's mode , and the , the user not the user , the man mana t_v_ manager mode .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we have five minutes left .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the settings we are agreeing are that they're required .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's just how to .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we should hide them somewhere .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "hide them , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in the menus of the or in the back of the remote control , like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", what else ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "power button's required .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this was thinking .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do we need power button ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because generally yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's setting , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it should fit in those settings functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because it's not very current useful function .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when they say power button they mean to turn the t_v_ on and off .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , it's after five minutes timer , no ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you don't need to every five minutes to keep it alive .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if you're watching t_v_ for two hours , you don't want your t_v_ to turn off after five minute based on our usability studies again , pe people said that the power button was very relevant button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we should keep this button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", it was nine out of ten re relevance .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we could what we could probably do is to keep also to keep the and all the buttons and , we could make it like opening style that if you open it you are you just turn on the t_v_ and if you close it , it will turn off the t_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you like this , because , t's question for you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we need to concentrate on the , the major usage of the control , which is you sit down , you turn on your t_v_ , you change channels , you change the volume , you turn the t_v_ off .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and all the other functionality is not used very often .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they can be hide somewhere by cover like this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like covering cu .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on the back , or for what ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like the but since we have the , we didn't need too much button too many buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like mobile phone covering .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", just the decision of the power button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "should we make it button , or some something which would be power button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "button is better .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it should be bu its own button on the front .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it if it's button or .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "button , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one big button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "old fashioned button , to satisfy the grandmothers .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , any other suggestions or functions ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what about things like the clock and timers ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do we still have the time ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have still one or two minutes to talk , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what was the question ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "clock or yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", some func some features on the control to display time , or to display probably not .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "usually it's already on t_v_ like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but since we want to control all the televisions , and it would probably be worth to set the timing on the remote , no ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because if the t_v_ turns on itself , it , if the time the timer should be there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we add the time , we have to have bigger display like that , and is it very useful ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are users wants to have the time on the remote ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is the question .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it useful ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's questi , it's trade-off .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in my opinion we should have only useful thing and because they want the simpler it's is better .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the t_v_ , and based on your but it can be on the display in corner all the time on the remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "very , very occasionally .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but do use the do use the display of the time quite often , but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's , that's true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so no time button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no time on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and do we need to include anything about the speech recognition and the speech commands , or ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "thin it will not take lots of place , we just need microphone and the software , so , and it sh and it will be little bit new and interesting , so people may be attracted to buy this and it's not very difficult to put software inside the electronic device and put microphone .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it doesn't take that much place and also that much it doesn't cost that much .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but
