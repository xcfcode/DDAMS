[{"edus": [{"text": "it fell off .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one , two , three , four , we're ready .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "welcome to this second meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes for this meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is meeting on functional design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and wanna welcome you all and all for doing some research in between .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did took the minutes from the first meeting and i'll show them to you in moment .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "know each of you have presentation and in thinking about the forty minutes , it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , each of you having about seven minutes or little more , little less for your pre presentations and little discussion , because there's happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some decision on what functions it will have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is this ap everybody agree with this ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and after the meeting there'll be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch , and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but now for the minutes of the first meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and go to that one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as you can see it was this earlier today .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "kate , steph , sarah and myself in our four capacities were present .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "opened the meeting , the product was developed and reviewed , and we talked about the financial end of it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it had some implications , the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the japanese .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting anybody have any questions on those minutes ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are they complete , did they discuss everything that we covered last time ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , we talked about the individual roles that we each had as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "did miss something ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm afraid incorporated that when said who was present , but yes , we did , and we did little bit of team building of making the pictures , but didn't think those were appropriate to the minutes necessarily .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so as group we've are they're accepting the minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "accept the minutes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is that what we're supposed to say ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then we'll move to the three presentations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we need to move this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "who wants to go first ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's as far as it goes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not really meant to touch those microphones .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it doesn't have any on , does it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "oy , big loop under the table .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "she said we didn't need to screw it in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that looks good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's doing its thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there we are .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one of the biggest issues found about from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these remote controls and that this is an opportunity to really take real reaction in the direction of similar of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "some of the research in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now , and that means we do need to make some decisions about what keys or buttons on the remote control to perhaps keep and what ones to discard .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if we devote some energy into this , the recent productions of real reaction , the go everywhere power and the high definition d_v_d_ players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these , we can also use this as platform to make it interact with other tools .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the high definition d_v_d_ players and all of this will come along in the will only benefit from the positive feedback from our designed tool .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so again , most users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fifty percent of all these numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and eighty percent of users , and if we think about this there are lot of television , d_v_d_ , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on remote control that looks fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "could can ask where these figures come from , is this market research we've .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it was market research and there were hundred people in the room , so eighty out of hundred said they would spend more money .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now in between , as the project manager , they sent me an email from the powers that be that teletext is outdated and the internet is coming in as important , but that they want this remote control to only be for t_v_ with incorporating the corporate image , colour and slogan .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can really focus on this remote and bring the real reaction brand in and get some positive marketing for our other tools , even if we directly don't advertise for the go everywhere line .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so an interesting element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so these market research questionnaires looked into your concern about technology and specifically wanted to find out information about speech recognition .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and luck lucky for us have the cash to pay for it , the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "very interesting , leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this if and , the designers , but ninety one percent , fifteen to twenty five , especially in terms of growth , this would be very smart group to target .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is that large enough target market to target it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , and with the technologies improving , if we can get these .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or eight million .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable and did know that it was an that's very good question .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if speech recognition should be included , but it's an interesting that shows more about being open to technology .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how i'm wondering how ou how our target price compares with the typical price of these things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it definitely needs lot more research on like how much more it would be and any , existing examples , and what reactions to them have been , and that thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "shall go back ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "expect an industrial designer should know that , but if we're aiming to build this thing for twelve euros fifty , is that lot or little ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "did not receive any information on that , but the competition , sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very important , because there is question about do you want an screen and that wasn't responded to , but some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate , so it turns into something perhaps you all have seen the osbournes where ozzy osbourne is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like small tray .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's and , no , you kate , you're exactly there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "sh surely he's in the wrong age group .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "he must be one of small population .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the key is to get the early adopters , people who are familiar with technology and they'll be , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we're not looking at whether they're early adopters on that screen , that's looking at age groups .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , and i'm making and i'm making the leap that people who are familiar younger people are more familiar with technology than older people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or comfortable , so the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist , power , channel , volume and everything else is up to the designers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you had the other power channel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and this is also supported by the market research .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's my contribution .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we'll turn to the next presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "she said we don't need to screw it in , just stick it in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then press , what ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "f_n_ and eight .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "next to the control button on the bottom , and then eight at the top .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then be patient .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here we go .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if you want it to go into slide show mode , it's that little button there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can not just do each one in order ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can if you like , it that just sets it up to do no that one , that one there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there we are .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "left , left bit , left bit , that one , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then you just press the click when you wanna go on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "technical functions design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "first off , do agree with what sarah has defined as your personal preferences,yeah .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we need more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions the same as what existing remotes have .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we can build on this with the speech recognition , that's not something i'd thought about , but it's also something we can discuss .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and presume we can miss out the functions really to video or d_v_d_ remote control , if this is only gonna be , satellite , cable , t_v_ remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so these are two models of existing remote controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the one on the left seems to be fairly standard universal remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it has fast-forward , stop , play , all relating to movies .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it also has seems to have channel up and channel down , which is more what you'd expect from , like sky or cable remote control where you've got hundreds of channels instead of merely terrestrial one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the , which has it also has play , stop and pause and everything , don't think we need them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we just need channel selection , volume up , volume down and an enter function where you can access it's not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not related to the internet one that you mentioned , because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and exceed the requirements they're expecting of us .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it really exceed the requirements , 'cause the requirements really are just want to be able to change channels and functions , which is more text on the screen thing than actual buttons was thinking something some smooth , sleek , little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and menu that you can access .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then do think we need to discuss the speech recognition possibility .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "any thing else you wanna add ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we could go back to the pictures of the , what're they called ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the pictures of the remote controls and possibly discuss what we think about them , but should hear what kate has to say first .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let's hear what kate has to say .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "afterwards we could do whiteboard with that your the one on the as basis .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the white that one on the is , as less cluttered , it's there but it's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "definitely less cluttered and but still it's was just i'll just resume something else was gonna say .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the style of these is terrible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "really think we need to not only possibly even materials , like the type of plastic used , but everything including size and shape of buttons , positioning of buttons , the actual shape of the hand-held device , colours , just every , everything to do with this has to be revolutionised .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the ergonomics , the way it fits in your .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but so that's that for now .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "haven't actually got display on my screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "still , i'll do without that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now wanna bring us down to earth again i'm afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and this is the methodology used in preparing for this meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i've been doing little bit of web-based research , and if had design team , would've been discussing my ideas with .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the net result is that i've come up with first cut for the working design that i'd like to discuss with you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , let's go back to what the basic function of remote control is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's for sending message , typically via infrared .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve euros fifty are an energy source , the user interface and which will in incorporate an integrated circuit that actually composes the message based on what the which buttons the user presses , we turn that into message , and then we need sending mechanism to send it to the receiver .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now would have hoped that's my only slide actually , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would have hoped to do you pretty powerpoint slide of my first cut design , but unfortunately the technology defeated me , so if you'll bear with me i'll do it on the whiteboard .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we want an energy source which is there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we've got to think about what that might be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we don't want wires on this thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "typically it would be battery , but i'm open to suggestions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then we have the user interface .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the main components in there are the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into message , which it then transfers to some sending mechanism , which encodes it and sends the message to the receiver .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so those are the basic things that we've got to get in for our twelve euros fifty .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but those things as long as we can get those components , the block , that rectangle for the user interface , is where the user comes in of what does it look like ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what do the buttons look like ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what does it feel like ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's where the user interface is really coming into its own .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the technical end is what's actually gonna be in there , but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the battery energy source or what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after certain amount of time , do you just replace it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is there any because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces , like for d_v_d_s , movies , whatever .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does it have to have way of being segregated from the others , in different frequency ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "may be wrong here , but i'd been thinking of this device as being cheap mass-produced device .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're trying to sell four million of , that's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and hadn't thought of it as being reparable thing , you just if it goes wrong you chuck it out , and that's why i'm bit concerned .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like the idea of speech recognition , that's idea , but i'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need gonna need to hit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do we have ki some idea of how much it would cost to create device that has these basic elements ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because then no , the chip composer marketing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "isn't that your job ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , the chip composer sender .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna give me some advice on that , if you're asking me , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't believe know , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what they cost .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "be because then we would ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass-produced , the which is the same as these existing models , just little bit more inspired , but just the same .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "although what suddenly came into my head is , how they always take two a_a_ batteries which is really not very efficient .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "could it be possible to have , like rechargeable internal battery , like an m_p_ three player does ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "with that you could jus or mobile phone or whatever .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you could , you just plug into power source for couple of hours , and then it's recharged for ages and ages , and you don't have to worry with replacing a_a_ batteries , which are you'd never need batteries would .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that has another element , which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on charger , then you then it has place .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it also has place , so exactly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it's not stuck down the back of the sofa .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then again if this is within our price range or not .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's really good idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "think that's very interesting idea , but i'm not very good industrial designer and much about what these things cost .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll do some research for the next meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "t's better than my idea about solar , probably .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "solar may not be so good when you're watching t_v_ in the night , but , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is just so annoying how no , but just rechargeable internal battery would probably it might cost more to at first to develop and to install , but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky a_a_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it would have to sor store up the energy and then use it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "solar can do that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we may be talking quite heavy then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would be too heavy and it'd cost too much .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so do you think we might make that selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "definitely , 'cause i'm thinking in terms of the loss and breakage of remotes , how much of that is to do with it not really having home , nest , place to live , exactly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have its little dock that you could put it in .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if you can dock it , you could argue that this is exactly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the dock could look very fancy and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "still if it's quite within our price range .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause you are talking about another component , like another piece of hardware .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are we as to what our target group is though ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that we'd be looking for the younger end .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "brought up some exactly , but you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there , or are they making purchasing decisions ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these are the , exactly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was wondering that , because ag agree that there there're people with how can put it , more money than sense and who are liable to buy something new , but bu but what was gonna say was , although they may be buying , personal music devices and all that , are they necessarily buying t_v_ remote controls ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "usually put more money than brains .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll make note of that , kate .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "good , good comment .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because they probably live in household that has t_v_ if they're at the lower end of the age range , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it might be good to know who , who's actually buying televisions and are we in region where people have more than one television in home ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we've got big hill to climb here , haven't we ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we've gotta persuade people who've got remote control 'cause it came with the telly that they should buy our product instead .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or do we make that it goes to the man through the manufacturer ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's probably more what it is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what would be more efficient way of doing it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and some of our d_v_d_ players incidentally have them , because we have the relationship with our own department , but moreover we need to go for the manufacturers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day , are we ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our functions , we've so far decided , that power , channel , volume make it attractive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it has to have an enter key and the number keys .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it has to have big user-friendly buttons and sh definitely we wanna be inspired that the current styles are just plain awful .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do we need let me br actually , the enter key have chart here that didn't include .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is that agreeable to everyone ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which might , those are felt like had lot of charts .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you want the gizmo ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "throw some light on that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually we're , we are almost half hour out of the forty minutes , so we have to get close to finishing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my only comment is we could somehow include an enter key in like power key if power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "enter , power as sum simultaneous key .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "again , thinking of menus or you're pressing enter , the thing would already be on , and so when you press power , initially it turns it on , press power again and use that as an enter so you press power after you've was thinking you to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession , and power follows something like channel up channel down power , and then that would make that choice .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is that with you ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was miles away .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how does that work ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was re was reading the chart to be honest .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how so how does that work , how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then you'd have to have an off te off key .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not getting bit complicated ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "could granny do this , or are we just not aiming at granny ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that has turning dial , where at the far end is on or off .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "who's got an ipod then ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "anyway , that was the only comment about some of the decisions people have made , what's most important .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's definitely channel , volume , power .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "things like screen settings and audio settings , would generally do them on the actual television itself , like here you have , little flap with little control panel on the actual box itself .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wouldn't know how to do it using remote control , so would say that they are definitely less relevant .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for looking at that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so easy to use is the other thing that we want to be able to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we don't wanna outsmart .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as you said , don't make it too hard for the granny .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "joined that set last week .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first grandchild arrived .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so are we then of those things ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and let's go back to agenda and hook me up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this oughta be fun .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it probably won't go the first time , it'll probably be like mess .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it lost it off here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , it was up there , but couldn't see it down here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this time it should be both .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how do you do that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how do you make it do both ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have to keep doing the financi the f_n_ and eight to five minutes to finish , lot for telling me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it toggles through , .",

individual work to continue our research and i'll put some minutes of this meeting together .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "your individual assignments are for kate to do the components , for you , steph , to do the user interface and for you the trend-watching .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and each of us will get help from our coach .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are we to get ourselves together and then have lunch ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then that's the end of this meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and hope that's good enough for her to tell her that's the end .",
