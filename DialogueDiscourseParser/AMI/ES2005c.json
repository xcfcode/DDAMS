[{"edus": [{"text": "we are so the meeting will have about the same format as the last time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so switching over i've just left my first two screens .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have mailed you the minutes of the last meeting just to save time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , don't .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then we shall start with presentation from raj .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "hi , me raj , again .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in this meeting i'm going to discuss about the trend watching , how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we have to look on this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "first of all methodology .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the met methodology to find out the trend was incl was done in way we have done rec not only recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also factor which will affect our sales and profit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what are our findings ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in our findings we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey we found that people do have preference for tho fancy mobi remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having functional look and feel good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we should take into we should consider this factor as the most important factor , because this factor is twice as important , the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as the third factor .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv in our mark means in take in designing our rem remote controls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the last one is the most important one , is it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no the first one is the outlook of the mobile , the it should have fancy outlook , the fancy design rather than just having functional look and feel good , it should have fancy look and foo feel good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the second most important aspect is that remote control should be technologically innovative .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo remote controls are .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that indicates our technological advancement .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , like it shouldn't be too much co complicated , there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi remote control , it shouldn't be too complicated like this way .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it should be and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that they could know how to use these remote controls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "when we did fashions , recent fashion our recent fashion update shows that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was just reading fruit and vegetables .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "hard to know how we are going to incorporate that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have to , because you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , and everything with fruits and vegetables , because the world is now changing it's trend towards organic , becoming more and more organic , becoming .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we should make big sponge lemon , and then it'd be it would be yellow .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's very good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so something like that we should do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and people the feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having plastic look , hard look .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's what we predicted anyway .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that they could play with it while handi while handling it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that should also be taken into consideration .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so these are my views .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the spongy , not real spongy , you can do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so no it ca the rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause we it shouldn't be have any harm to the environment also , because our company is very for taking all these concerns into consideration , so we don't want to have any harm to the society , so that's all .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "fruit and veg , there you go .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just what of when of remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and were there any factors that weren't important in the survey , that they said we don't want ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we didn't find out any such point .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or was it just .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , there could be , but we couldn't find out any , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what is it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , it's got it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then five , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the interface concept .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the interface specification , what people how they interact with it , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the method , we looked at existing designs , what are the what's good about them , what's bad about them , looked at their flaws , so we're going to look at their flaws , everything .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and what the survey told us and what we think would be good , so bit of imagination .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the findings , i've got some pictures to show you as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so most remote controls use graphical interface , where you have got buttons and you point it rather than having the output as stream of text .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we also found that there's inconsistent layout , which makes it confusing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so for our remote control there is some inconsistency already in ec existing in between remote controls , but standard shape and play and those but buttons like the top for on and off , people find that important,'cause then it's easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we've got some pictures of some new remote controls to show you .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do press escape five ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no just escape should .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or just escape , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "still haven't got my glasses on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so these are the some of the pictures of existing ones .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll just walk you through them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this one is voice recognition .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that's the idea we're going for .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "looks pretty complicated .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's an thing , which we thought could get bit confusing and bit expensive as for us .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this one is got scroll like mouse , which .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like the middle button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and but i'm not exactly how you'd use that , like would the computer come , that's like the one , is it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's kinda like scrolling , if i'm thinking of the one , i've got the same thing in front of my monitor , you scroll it and the when you reach the menu item that you require , you press the middle of the scroll .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the one below that has got like little scroll function on the side .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but presume that the functions must come up on the t_v_ screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's what that is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so these are just few ideas .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "again that's just quite boring shape , grey , looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , on that one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "looks like something out of jet .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it looks threatening .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it does look dangerous .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it looks like .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this one was really .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's got the programmability function that we talked about .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can put it in there , it's for your kids , and it's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that's really easy to use , bright , so like this one lot for our design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "something like that would be good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the one thing about these ones is these kl secured areas , i've seen lot of them with the cover missing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so like have it hinge rather than clip on or whatever .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and this one , the over-sized one , about you , but it's bit too gimmicky .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't think that will sell very .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is that not to assist the blind , is it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's bit exactly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then blind don't watch t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no they do , they do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they listen to it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and this one is just pointing out .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like some of these things the raised symbols and everything , but pointing out that this one the volume it is pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that could that's bit confusing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the buttons on this are it's just showing you how you can have different buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they don't have to be all the same .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's quite .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway , don't they ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so there are some of the findings .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we need to combine those ones and i've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it is , just in time , very handy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so incorporating that in our design would be good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's you program it like you say , record , and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and like that , so that's and it's much .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's quite .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "personal preferences just some imagination , the raised symbols were good , the , it does look smart , but for our budget , do you think that would be bit too expensive to have the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the and the other , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the speech recognition , 'cause we're definitely going for the speech recognition , are we ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , but they want the quality , they want fancy look , they want some new design , something new .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but our budget , we've .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so even if we increase our cost little bit , within some limits , and we give something new technological advancement as new design with fancy outlook , we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have good sales in the market .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm not if the if for twenty five euros per twelve euros fifty manufacturing cost , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'t see tha although , to be they have got they are going crazy with the technology now , so that you've got your t_v_s and everything so the small but like the black and white , it just doesn't look funky enough .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour screens , ju wouldn't know about the costs of them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but price not withstanding , is it too complicated , is it gonna be too much just overload ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the it will be easy because there will be , on screen , there will be different frent icons , they can just click , whatever they wa .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the thing , because .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the thing is when you use remote control , you never look at it , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you're looking at the t_v_ and it's it just seems like needless so which vegetable ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's true , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so i'm not about the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's , it's good idea , but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "child-friendly , this was good , as you pointed out the bit , it often goes missing especially with children , but it's good shape and the organic is we could make vegetabley round shape , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could make .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "know , carrot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "si since we're going for the company colours , your lemon wasn't that far and if it doesn't work , we've just made lemon .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what are the options ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we don't want it to be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the child-friendly , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "easy to use , it seems quite easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like the different shapes of the buttons and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's good idea to go for .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like the colourful buttons as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the mouse one , it was good idea , because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we are marketing to twenty five to thirty five , so most people will have come in contact with that use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so they'd be able to use that , as said i'd presume it would come up on the screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so there you go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the t_v_ maker , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's the user interface design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , i'll take this out now then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so there are lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among , and i'll give you the , technical considerations for those .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "looks like it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was just thinking the self same thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and i'm gonna use the whiteboard , just 'cause we haven't used it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , the way i'm gonna do this is we're gonna take look at some old remote controls , see how they work , reuse the vital essential pieces of it , and then we'll throw in our new innovations and keep it all within budget .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , looking inside very simple remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is what they sent me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here's the competition , suppose .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you open it up , there's circuit board inside , and there's chip , processor , the t_a_ one eight three five , which receives input from the buttons , and ch , it's very they're very cheap remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is standard off the shelf chip , is it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this remote costs nothing , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that takes signals from the buttons and translates it into sequence of pulses that it then sends to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , and then that gets sent to the l_e_d_ light , which kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end , and that sends out the infrared light signal to the television .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here it is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control , because it defines the no , this is very old one , so now with the new technology this is minimally small and cheap thing to make .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so can we make them to any size we like or is there minimum or ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they gotta be almost key-ring .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is what we need to have for certain .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , as we said , we got the outer casing , which we have to decide , what's it gonna be , the board we have to use the same set-up , processor , we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , amplifier and transmitter are all standard .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so for the casing , this an e-mail got from our manufacturing team , we have bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot , latex , double-curved , curved .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so lots of choices , what do we think ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or sponge , isn't on there , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like la latex has kinda spongy feeling to it , doesn't it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm not about the sponge .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's very elasticy for .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that would also give it kinda durability and ther that's also sorta relatively cheap to cast .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , here are plastic , latex .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so plastic initial plastic with latex kinda sheath ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like the rubber , the stress balls , that could be bit of gimmick like it's good to hold and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what that is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so something with give to it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the colour is yellow , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yellow incorporated , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or at least incorporating , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "forgot we're what other standard silver other parts or .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the buttons like , 'cause there's gonna be the cover the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours or if we're having buttons actually , don .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so yellow for the body , and then what colour for the buttons ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so multi-coloured buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you do have ones like play could be green or on and off is red , and like that , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or limit even just limited multi-colour so it doesn't look too childish , perhaps .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "makes it easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's true , because that blue one did look quite hardish .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "although this also comes to shape as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we are gonna make it novel double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , bit comfier , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the shape we wanna go how exactly ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "double what about banana ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like an hour glass figure , is that what you're thinking of , or just like it's not .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's , that that'd be that's comfortable to hold , easy to hold so you don't drop it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we could make novelty remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like we could have big banana shaped remote control , 'cause it's yellow fruit , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", like , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and lemon might be little hard to grip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then how would you point it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how would you point it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it doesn't matter which end you point , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could have little l_e_d_s on each end .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they only cost pennies .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "appreciate this idea , because then this will help us in our advertisement also and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people's choices .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that what our data shows that , so this the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables , like people now spongy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm not about the banana idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so spongy banana re .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that does it does seem bit again childish .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just draw on the fruit and vegetable shape .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and what else did you say about fashions ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what was trendy ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "see so an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable like so it would have stem perhaps and it'd be axially symmetric .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and spongy , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like what's that , don't even know the name of it , some , where it's like looks like little snowman thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the name of that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it'd look like this kinda .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's what was thinking .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like gourd almost , or squash of some sort ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's what they are .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it has clear top and bottom so you could say , it transmits from this end .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "why the hell not .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let's that'll make us fifty million euros .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what do you guy what do you think ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's dra you don't necessarily have to have it clearly identified as fruit just to have that fruitish shape , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then only we can relate it with something .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can relate it by advertising or .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so double-curved , single-curved , what do we feel ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have public survey , let the public choose what they want .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's good man .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's good idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", since you're the marketing guy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll , we could do that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "will be happy to do that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and buttons would , did we say ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "different shapes of buttons ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "su for the specific functions , up and down , play , stop .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they've got , they've got standard intuitive things that are always used .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with the scroll-wheel or no ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "speech recognition , so we need microphone presumably .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "could put the microphone here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's the microphone .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "where should put the microphone ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ho wel are we that scroll wheel does give ease of use ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "those ideas saw were just for inspiration , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "glad , we're not doing this for real .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no i'm not .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can do some user test with scroll-wheels , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone would put it sub-centrally , so it's .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so should the microphone be just anywhere on it or there's the mic .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it can be held and we really need really gonna need to hold it , if it's gonna be voice recognition .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so let's not use the whiteboard any more .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so what else was there ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the what about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are we just gonna leave that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "still like it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that's me .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you still like it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause we've got the technological innovation with the speech recognition system .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , or it's just going bit too far .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause it could .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't wanna overkill .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "especially with yellow .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause like if we how good is the speech recognition thing ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do we want to go for buttons , do we want to just have device that sits and pretends it's fruit ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then you put it in the fruit bowl ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", and then you just tal like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they can work from you don't have to hold it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers , they have fruits all round them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "make them think of fruit , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now just make they don't eat the remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "some like think of fruit that could sit independently on its own like , an apple .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do we need buttons ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then it's just apple so , yellow apples though .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "quite like the shape .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "quite like the design of that , 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite got quite steady base .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", that's good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and as we say we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , about the speech thing , it doesn't have to be hand held or close .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it can sit at distance and pick it up still .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so like you could actually , gives you the options .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or we can do one thing , we can just have remote control and casings of different shapes , different fruit shapes in such way that any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , it will look .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so selection of casings .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause you said about disposable , didn't you ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it fi it fits with marketing like mobiles , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you said about disposable earli people want disposable things so we could do that , like have choice .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like if this is like if this is mobile phone we will design casing in such way like half of , we need not to have full cover , we will just have half of cover , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if somebody wants it in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give banana shape look .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put we will put apple shape casing on that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it will give apple shape look .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so in that way you can have any , that means whatever you want , without .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we still need the buttons in the same places thought , don't we ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can standardise those , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the other side .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing , so half of that will be look the , not the upper side .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so from lower you can , it means while you are holding of from this side you can have banana look or apple look , whatever .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so in that way we need not to have different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "tho if you're gonna have facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons , 'cause when if you think about it if they're wanting it , 'cause they want to look at it , if they're using it , and what they want to look at is facing away from them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it doesn't really 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it , unless you have you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with microphone so that you can place it face down .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you've got the facia , and you can just talk at the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , we decided on material , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you've narrowed it down to half dozen options .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that spongy latex rubber everything feel , and the colours we got down , and the shape , we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because , i'm not if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , because we should just take the inspiration from the fruit and because what , wh wha would we're trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as they said .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we stick with what we've got there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they wanted something that looks fancy and fruit could be bit of too much of gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , because al already we're going bit gaudy with the yellow , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could make it pale yellow .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's gotta be our company's yellow .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so again like we could have , we could quite easily have the main body be different colour , but have kinda going round , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "even if not necessarily that the whole body has to be of the company colour , so blue and yellow tend to go to we together .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's the more you move it , it's got wee thing inside that just kinda powers it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as for the energy source , almost every remote control uses just batteries , but we don't have to be limited by that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can use hand-dynamo .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what that means , we crank it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's like those watches that you so , this might be an idea that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like with those watches that you twist .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like that , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if it if it's not working , people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but do you think that it will be good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you shake it and scream at it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it is , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because then people have to , like if the cell is out of bat , to mo .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it does leave them with an obligation to especially if they want to use it sp specifically as voice activated .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because most of the people .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then if it's just sitting on the , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what are the other options ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's solar power .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "solar power will also not be good idea , because then they have to keep their mobiles outside in solar energy , and the days when there is no sola sunlight .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm with raj on that , i've got no i've got north facing house , there's not really ever sun coming in my window .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so probably just .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but like just normal light ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we should rechargeable battery will be good idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they can recharge it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that idea that just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that bother is having , having rechargeable stand , so that not only it doubles as stand , but for using it as recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we're very environmentally friendly company , aren't we as ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like hand like one of those portable phones thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's , exactly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so rechargeable battery .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the user interface , the buttons , we talked about this already .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what's chip on print ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what's , never mind .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the electronics , the more features we add , this one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in , which adds to the cost as you can expect .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we can keep it all under budget .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so yes , so the speech thing you said our techno our research and development department came up with some break-through .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so just in time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of chipping .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just in time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and keeping the screen out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're excuse i've just deleted that whole thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text":
