[{"edus": [{"text": "so in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare prototype for the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so let's see the what did you prepare .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so can you go out to the shared folder ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the shared folder .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "sh share folder for your presentation ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have presentation .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because have here just one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so got the participant three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's the final design , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so discussed with guillaume .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so we have and we are both on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an or not because it's too expensive .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we come up with two versions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one with and one without l_c_d_s .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but both comes with charger and then detachable and or control module .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and detachable big buttons for all people .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so i'll show you the two prototypes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "here we have the first one with the beautiful display .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you can just browse into the navigation menu by joystick joystick-like button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like enter function .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have on the side here the microphone for the speech recognition system here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and here the switch that control if you want it's the but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "why you put it in the side ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not good place .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no it's the all around camer microphone isn't it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it an only single mic or microphone array ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's microphone array .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's very costly , microphone array .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no it's just single microphone , and you we put it here because when you are browsing your you will be close to t's better to place it here than here , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and here is little switch that control if you want the speaker recognition system to be on or off .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so this remote control comes up with its charger .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how much does it cost this one ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this prototype is made for about fi fifteen dollars , but t's not it's not , but it's just prototype and if we optimises the voila .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's above the budget .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the cost would be le reduced .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the and the production costs we can achieve about ten dollars .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how many battery is there ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how many , excuse me ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "battery , we use about .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is it the two a_a_s batteries in it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "a_a_ rechargeable batteries .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "rechargeable , because we have the charger .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have the charger so it's no problem .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you just on one battery .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so one battery ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that two or one ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's kinetic reserve .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually it's flexible thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now what is the whole day rating for that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the excuse me ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "whole day's rating .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what type of battery ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's just simple battery rechargeable if you like it's exist .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "something like two , three size batteries ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the charger and leave it alone , it's alright .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then the next time you pick it , it works .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "forgot to tell you there is only single button there , this button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just explain the button norman .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this button is like the mouse is like joystick , you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make turn and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have click you have double click all in single button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can move up , down , left , or you can do swing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so swing to the left , swing to the defines other functions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so even though it's single button , but it is pretty flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the is this one , on the remote ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is the version that comes with .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "here present another version without the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's not good idea because after one or two months of function is getting destroyed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is new prototype .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's so we have the second version also with the different button configuration .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the second version is also simpler , we had just have to put the microphone also .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's the same .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also the switch .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's the same things as presented before .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but here we have four buttons for navigation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "press one button acting as enter button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so according to what you said it's more robust to the user .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it's also cheaper to produce .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can produce such remote control for about four dollars .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no four dollars , it's good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you forgot point here to have an button to find the charger , because that's major that's and if you disable speech recognition system then ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no actually we'll come to that point in our .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's embed in the speech recognition system .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so norman will explain to you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll come to that point later on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we will serve the charger with this ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they either these with the charger any in either versions you they ha they use the same charger .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "with the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the price of the charger included in the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's standard module so you should get it for cheap price .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but again depends on the types .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have to investigate more on that , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the price should be below twelve and half euro .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but as the marketing manager says , people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's so we have just the price of selling is twenty five euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "people are willing to pay more , but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the price of production that's for this basis function and if you want more you pay more .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright go on norman with the special features .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or something like customised .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we'll come up to that , the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you want less function if you want reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , so is modular .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the , you can take it you can put it back in , or you can use the other one , or the speech recogniser with the microphone .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you want microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's pretty flexible in the price .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you also have the two other modules for the parental control that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control if you want to have more power on what you do , and which channel you want to choose and so on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you should present that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and this is other one ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "here is just the module for the kids and if the parents want to watch t_v_ , up they come up with their modules , they just plug in it and they can have all the control they want here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we also have this module for old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , and it acts like the previous one , you just plug in and it works .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the idea the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons but here you only have few buttons but you retain the same powerful functionalities .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but in addition with simplicity .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's the best idea , the cond that that's our an innovation in this design here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now we come to other important features that did not tell you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add-on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then we also have security feature this here it's very robust , it doesn't break and the material , what's the material again ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the titanium and so it's very so the price to produce for the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "again and the battery life is an endurable one , again because this is a_a_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "lithium-ion may be good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then the other points are robust and misplacement reminder .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so when you finish watching your t_v_ and you the you turn off the t_v_ , and then there's this message coming out that put that back to the charger , so that's the or is it that's the reminder part .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it also use programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define so ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also of t_v_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the t_v_ contents of the night .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's pretty powerful , and that's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and for the materials that is cheap to produce it's quite clear from .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and also like the and the fancy designs .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can improve more on the design but this is the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what's the price to produce ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's about it the without the charger it's about two dollars to produce the microphone and speech recognition systems .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "with the charge ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with the charger ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "two dollars for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if you sum up everything wi with the , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we don't have charger .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's about so the total cost if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about fifteen dollars .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can use excel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we don't have all the options .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "charger we don't have charger here either .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no it's below the budget .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it's just if you want all functionalities .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's below the bu the budget .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's input but we have an other inputs from the public demands .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we will just have rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu we can just go to my presentation then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can wind up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or we could come to some final conclusions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and in the market the people are not really interested with , without , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and very handy to hold .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in that we could put or recognition to be more technologically innovative .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the third one is easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that the technical in innovation is in the product itself since we haven't yet remote who are allowing to choose interactively with the t_v_ screen with just four buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if we go to the next slide , here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and so this in paris and milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or vegetable , or whatever they like .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it should be much more customised to make different shapes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the problem is that is it robust to mishandling ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have you should find material that is robust at the same time spongy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so finally we have these three criterias .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one is fancy look , second is innovative , and third is easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so these are the three criteria on which we are going to build our remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these , say that we have seven point scale , from one to seven , and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so now you have with and without , so on this scale , if it is true , if it is if it has fancy look you could just tell me one , or if it is false , it doesn't it looks it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we can make our study on this and no we have you have designed two products now , one is with and without .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so is the evaluation depending on us or other users ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but who will give the scoring we ourself or third party ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "according to you , no according to you designers , how will feel does it with and without ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let us make this l_ and without .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "on this scale the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how do you look how does it look ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "doesn't look much fancy i'll say three or four .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you both agree for that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can improve on the design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "som someone commented this is like the stone age design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's it technical aspects .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have been focused all this time on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as for the design we should hire designer to help .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so take three on with ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so without how would you rate it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's more easy to make fancy things when it's not complicated so removing the gives us li more liberty to have fancy look .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and in the sense of innovativeness , with .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "t's it's the same for both so will give five , six .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "five with and so without ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "five also norman .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "from the innovation aspect feel that what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw in the last meeting is that the retrieval of t_v_ programmes by content , because that is really innovative , and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity , few buttons , we've lot of functionalities .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "with lot of functionalities .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that is for both our gi that the our product is has the best in all this is biased judgement because we designed them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the innovation is very high .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for both it's the same innovations .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's the same innovation .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so put six to seven .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "six , let's go for six .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no actually to make it with you make more efforts .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so there is high innovativeness included if you make it with then when it is without there is not much innovativeness .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we can't go that what you are sayin that's what the design no it's like this , on the , according to what understand from your model is , you have joystick here , and you have , you just press your joystick , you get here programme .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there was issue here is that what are what is the display on the ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we haven't really determined what are actually it's good to have but what are we gonna display on ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "talk about but you have the same programme on the t_v_ screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so let's remove it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but yes exactly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then no on the t_v_ you don't it doesn't display on the t_v_ now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but this is the problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you have the , but if .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then there is no meaning in having it on the t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or then again you have channels , volume and all the and what that depends upon your design , so without you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you cannot display all on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "anyway for the users who opt for we'll give them the give them the , we give what the customer wants , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and which do you recommend easy to use , with or without ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons , and the menu are clear , well-organised , so with little knowing of the technology you can easily use the product so will give six for the easy to use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no it's just if see the rate it's better to do it without .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because that's with just will increase the price , and thi they have the same rate so without it will be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or we can just go back to the previous slide where we ha we have few updates .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes according to fruit and vegetable or spongy touch without and without speech recognition .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "even then our product is going to be very good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's cheaper to produce .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if the we have less technology we have more liberty to for the shape and things like that so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the easy to use aspect is different for different people .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for the young generation easy to use may be very complicated because they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for kids they want simply the similarit for the old people they want simplicity , so that's why we have the parental module .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can ha have build more complex design if they want it , but what i'm trying to say here is that the we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so in terms of easy to use it's very user customisable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "user customisation is very important .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's the same .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so without take it five ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or you want it to be six ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes as you say , with better .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's better to have this without .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and to improve the look .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as our programme manager pro project manager says that without it is going to reduce the cost also , and it's going to be much simpler to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes and to give us more liberty to have fancy look so let's go back to our laboratory and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what about the sys speech recognition ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to improve on the design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what about the integration of speech recognition ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the speech recogniser is add-on module .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's going to be an optional .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if somebody wants to buy it they can have it , otherwise no .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's optional with the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's an optional .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's optional , since according to this study people more likes more to have spongy remote control than .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it will be it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because parents will lose these .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if you have an add-ons , the kids may just hide the parental module and so that their parents can't use it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or parents they can for forget where they put it or , so mayb better if you have all this in the same .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in the same set , and individual buttons to make them work .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the problem is if we are bla if customer wants certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we might lose the customer because of this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what do you think ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you mean that even if these modules will be functional will be optional .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes exa what do you think , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you are marketing manag .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how to make marketing survey that how many married couple or how many couples have t_v_ or to the number or singles who have television .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it inc increase .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so based on that but you can make it on single p_c_ with three different options .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the question is does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "t's about the same because if you can if you had something li no , because if you add something because it's three different pieces to build but it's cheaper if you already built the all the functionalities on the same module , but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on the same p_c_b_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ll the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you gonna maintain the you're gonna keep the same customer , because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if don't buy now they can buy in the future .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you could just provide with an optional .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer , attracting them to come back in again .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's something like microsoft product update .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're not trying to follow the microsoft and we don't want to the buyers can be up the would be can be upgraded , it would be good thing ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we don't want that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "updates and we sell it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we make updates and sell it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it depends on the production .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and what's the idea about the shape of the remote controls ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can they be made into fruit and vegetable types ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we are but we are also the components will have to change because we have to deal with the shape and but don't will increase the cost too much so but it's bit complicated to if you need machines to different machines to we can have the same global shape and then add on skins and with this tex spongy texture things like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you require different types of p_c_b_s and or it could be like this the p_c_b_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior shape is different for all .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what we can change is to propose the customers with skins .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin and then people just feel that have new skin and looks better .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can pl in what material would that be in ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you need to look into the material .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or furry like pet dog thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so project evaluation project satisfaction , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we finished the prototype presentation if you have something else to say .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the project manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have to ask these question .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to give answers so project evaluation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "suppose that you this criteria , is it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "room for creativity .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this room is bit small , but it's for us to work with .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "feel it's fine , we know we don't need it's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that was good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is fine for making presentat for project presentations .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "anyway we have the laboratory nearby to build our modules so it's .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the leadership was excellent .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "he gave you the liberty to talk as you wants .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the teamwork was very good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was really am very satisfying to work with you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and new ideas found .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "any new ideas to make these presentations more interactive and more interesting ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "come up with new product .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what
