[{"edus": [{"text": "is everyone here ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is our conceptual design meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and i'll just take few minutes and go through the previous minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make decision on the concept for the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll go through the mee through the minutes first .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we just refreshed our goal of making the finest remote control available .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and our marketing expert gave us some information from interviews with hundred different remote users .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with some statistics that backed what we were thinking before .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "people thought their remotes were ugly , that remotes zap lot .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they only use finite amount of buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that they often lose the it's easy to lose remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and some locator .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "either button or tracking device .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that it should look different than what's out there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "mixed response on the speech recognition .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the younger people said they wanted it , older people did not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we decided that the expense was not necessarily worth it , and that it was probably gimmick , that would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then the user interface designer explored some of the technical functions of the remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the simple versus the complex .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the simple one being better for user , the complex better for an engineer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be user-oriented remote , something simple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that we didn't wanna go with universal remote , because increasing cost and increasing complexity .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we would just have t_v_ remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have it be something that looks different .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and finally our industrial designer gave us rundown of how the remote will work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "from energy source , what we would use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "batteries because we don't wanna have cable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how that would power the remote and the lamp .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we were to have one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the user interface then would connect to chip , which would work with the infrared controls to send the signal to the t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "believe then we came up with couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "something that will fit into easily into someone's hand .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and with , just few buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just the basics .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and with scrolling function also .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and will leave that , leave it at that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're watching trends .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can have your cable ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "suppose that you can have this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so was looking at trend-watching .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "unfortunately wasn't given too much information .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was given brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then i'll just tell you some personal preferences that got from that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design , which we've already discussed before .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these are all things we've already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and thirdly the remote would be easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as far as fashion update , we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that might be bit of challenge to incorporate this into our remote , but we can try .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so from that , as we've already said , we need to focus on fancy look-and-feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we've already discovered that it's hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that , even if it's very subtle , we need to trick our consumers , so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for technologically innovative , we've talked about the tracking device .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and manuel had suggested the energy source and the user interface , discussing some of those , that we could change little bit .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we need to keep it simple , have limited buttons , which the two piece idea might be really beneficial for .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of fruit or vegetable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it was banana shaped .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or with exterior designs .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but my question is , the stereotypically speaking , you picture males with their remote controls , and i'm not how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we could have something that's somewhat removable , or , different options for female , male target groups .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then the spongy feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could look at mobile phones and other technology that's out there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and look at different types of material that might our users who want spongy-feeling remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so possibly like , just to butt in for second .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "possibly like cover like they have for mobile phones ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's what was thinking .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "those like , spongy ones .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have one with flag , and one with banana and one that's spongy feel to it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so when you buy your remote you can buy various coverings .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can various covers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what's it called ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "cust you personalised , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "personalise your remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could leave that to the cover department .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we all know they've got nothing to do all day .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "why can't see the crazy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to , will use the , consumer will use the actual device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i've looked at some of the was sent , try and get some inspiration .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but keep in mind that our own ideas that we had .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they gave an example of coffee machine where you program question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's different ways of user can use products like remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's graphical use , where you look at pictures and on screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "command line where you type things in , and you get response .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then it ju that's just to point out the inconsistent use of interface in remotes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can't really see that picture , but there's various different remotes , once again with lots of different buttons on , making it more complicated .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , then had look at new products that are on the market .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not necessarily remote controls but ones that you'll recognise .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is the voice , there is voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have there is picture .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you surf your favourite channels with your voice .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "store up to eighty speech samples , controls four devices , t_v_ , cable , satellite , v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ and audio .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you can record your own verbal labels , that are connected to remote control functions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the technology is there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting , where there has scroll down functions on the side .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can just make those out .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then on the is an ipod , which is possibly one of the simplest things to use out there , and really is , and all that is just big scroll menu that you go through .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that is possibility .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and nothing's simpler really .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then there's things like this , which is kid's remote , where the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the remote control it only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it means that children have novelty of having their own remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if there's possibility of having one remote contr like we just had two components , it can have more components , different remotes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the point made at the end there here is that you have to be need to be clear on your devices , as to what , things you use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "sometimes an arrow pointing down , which may suggest volume down , could become confused just as v_ for volume .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "carrying on from what i've already said , user friendly remote with minimum buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have speech recognition thing , you could control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then just have the simple hand-held thing that we devised earlier , as the actual remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't it could be graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port could have like an ipod where you just control through the menus .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like gets more and more compli complicated .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then the hand-held bit should be ergonomically designed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that is it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "where are we ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just to show you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they've even got things like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which is just for your gr ninety year old grandma ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's industrial design for cranes , like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "makes sense , makes sense .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "notice the giant dog bone shape ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also good for animals .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "why's my screen crazy ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm going to bore you with couple of descriptions of the interior .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the in there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i've more information on possible materials as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what we can and cannot do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but let's just for this to load up and i'll show you what we're talking about here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the underside , that's pretty cheap piece of technology really top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , and it passes it on to row of further transistors and like that on the side that actually amplify the signal , which later on is being , is being transferred to infrared lamp which then shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal it's getting and will do what you tell it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so much for the workings of the remote control itself .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "its job is to for you to press key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , that are received by the television .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "when you press key you complete specific connection .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it produces morse code line signal specific to that button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the signal to the l_e_d_ which translates the signal into infrared light .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the sensor in the t_v_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal reacts appropriately .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is the circuit board from the other side .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the lower part of it , if you can see that properly , with the green greenish board is what we saw in the first slide just flipped over .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can see the circuit board itself .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the cheapest way to make electronic connections on the market .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what you do is you have , don't have cables , but you have the connections actually in these lines on the board .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "these are the actual keys that are being pressed .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they close the electric circuit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that then sends the signal to the chip on the other side .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would be behind here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which sends it over to the transistors and all that amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now as you can see this is the rubber button version of it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the way it works is that you have the keys here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the rubber button has little metal plate on the other side , which closes the circuit here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and thus gives on the signal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now this is the simple version .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we are talking this the simple and cheapest version at the same time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we are talking something more complicated , it's going to be more expensive as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and not only that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i've gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic , rubber , as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's pretty squishy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would serve that purpose .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could also use wood , or titanium .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what's the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "fya don't have an information on that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "however our company can provide us with the titanium , so assume , i'm , was given an to use it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it certainly is an expensive material , i'm aware of that , but was given an .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but there are certain restrictions to certain materials .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now let's first go through the list with the materials .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can also mix these .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as for the energy source , we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what we could use is , or what was offered , or what we could use , is basic bateer battery .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could use solar cells .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or device that was not further specified that provides kinetic energy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "such as like watches .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "where you just move them move the actual device and this pr provides it with some energy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you don't wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "solar cell is interesting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "may fail though , every here and there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would you have to leave it by the window ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or you lose it , it lies behind the couch for week and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "always the you but exactly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "works arizona but in edinburgh not so no batteries are probably the way to go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the kinetic energy thing might work , but the same problem .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it starts to work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so i'd say what we're stuck with really is the basic battery .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which also makes base station obsolete .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we don't need that then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "however our interface options are push-buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in which in the production of which or in manufacture of which our company is expert .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "however we've discussed that scroll wheels are better option .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and they are possible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have an for scroll wheels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the ipod i've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an into the remote control as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this however may exclude certain materials .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you have squishy remote control , then an screen may be affected by the movement .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "hence we might not be able to put it in there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so there's also restrictions to , when it comes to the chip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we have more sophistic sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic set-up that we that i've just presented , the chip has to be more sophisticated and thus more expensive as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't have any details to , when it comes to the cost but it will be significant difference .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have more sophisticated chip , but that's not up to me to decide really .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's for the scroll wheel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it limits our choice and squishy is hip , so i'd say rather not go for that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let's see now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "solar cells cannot be used on curved or latex surface or remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that's not our problem since we have decided or against solar cells , assume ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or is anybody still alright .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional assume .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "with the titanium we cannot make it curved design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we would just be able to make it flat and straight design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which assume would exclude some of the more sophisticated versions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would the spongy and the plasticky thing you can get those mobile phones that initially have it is plastic but then they have cover on it which is just soft and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if that would still be possible to have in plastic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then where do people hold it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just all be spongy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts , so they can remove it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you as the possibility of having graphical display on it , like screen ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like the ipod ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can have an screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but therefore no rubber will be used .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so plastic yes , titanium yes , but this will influence the form .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "with plastic , as understand it , you can use any form .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "latex is tricky .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or rubber and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the way to go is if you want scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular , add an screen , and then you can choose either plastic or titanium .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or wood even .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you wanna make it particular shape , use plastic .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "add an screen , add scroll wheel , that'll be fine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or make it just push-buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "plastic gives you the biggest variety of options .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not the nicest feel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or not much originality really .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the ru the rubbery we can shape it however we want ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or the rubbery we cannot ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with rubber we could sh shape it the way we wanted it , but we cannot add scroll wheels , and we cannot add an screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the tricky thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "could we not have shape with scroll and the screen , and then just that initial shape we had , just which is banana-esque .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's thing if we did it yellow .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you just stick on just rubber things that grip the thumb bit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they wouldn't have any they're just on the exterior .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is that an option , plastic shell with rubbery coating on at certain spots ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "certainly can be done yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if that doesn't affect the functional side of it all .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like say just the underside or so then it can be done .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the fruit design how about affecting the surface of the actual remote control ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "say we don't make it particular fruit shape , but give it like the surface of an orange , banana , whatever .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you name it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what about smell ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to the remote ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you could just sell it in different colours as suppose .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in different ye yellows .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "bright citrus colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't suppose we have to stick to co stick to the colours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we're supposed to stick to the company colours though , that's yellow and grey .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yellow and grey .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yellow and grey .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what have we , lemon , banana , is grapefruit is what we'd go for , when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would say , if were to make decision , would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower end of the spectrum of importance .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit-minded remote buyer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "having shape could be little ridiculous , like kinda do .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have it banana-shaped already , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if it's yellow ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if it was done yellow , which is company colour .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so why not add couple of grey stripes and make it look like banana ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's couple of grey stripes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that person could turn it over .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "on the gr the rubbery grips could be grey .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it would look like banana just sitting on their table .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "rather than rather the holder , if we were to have holder , it could be shaped like fruit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it could and then you could actually put the banana-shaped thing on the fruit bowl , on the coffee table , and then people would always know where it was .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "could look like fruit bowl .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it could be an ape .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "could be , it could be an ape or fruit bowl .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could have variety of options here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you have more to your presentation ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "informed you about the materials , what the interior has to look like , and what the limitations to certain materials are on there you go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm gonna plug in here real quick .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like said we have to make decision on couple of these items here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so is the two piece idea out ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or have we not decided ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "rid of that because gonna use battery .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the base station might not be necessary .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can still design two-piece remote without having base , having one of them be base station , but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions , or you take out the smaller piece .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can still do that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "however this would be like designing two remotes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so which then , as understand it , would probably limit the , limit again the use of certain materials , because they would be too expensive .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "say like have scroll wheel and on both of them , or have an screen and so on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you'd probably have to stick rather with just traditional rubber button design which we saw there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but could be done , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source , the chip-on-print , and the case .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "probably case material .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and probably shape also .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape , what the type is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and what supplements we'll have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "energy source we've , we've decided batteries , although not exciting , are probably our best bet .",
