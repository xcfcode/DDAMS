"this is just the preliminary , get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and what we would roughly what we would incorporate into new one .", "speaker": "C"},

teeny tiny things or we are going that's big and video and ts hi-fi and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it seems like there's tension between two ideas , you want one remote that can work all of the functions of t_v_ and if you have whatever associated with t_v_ the d_v_d_ player , like that , but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with thousand buttons on it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you now that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause was thinking something that's got different like an display on it that's got different pages

"A"}, {"text": "so do we have to be realistic within the budget or close pr how much it would cost .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "at the moment we could , wa we 'cause we this is what we what we're doing at the moment is just saying what we'd like , and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "couldn't we have like one that comes out ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so would be to have something that controls lots of different things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like so you have one in like it doesn't have to be really thick .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "remote controls can be thin bits .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then you have one for your d_v_d_ and you slide it out , and then you have another one , you slide it out .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then it all comes compact into one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's not you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and into one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's an idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you just flip them out .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have one very complicated one on one side with all the d_v_d_ and v_c_r_ access and , and then on the other side one remote control that would be very simple with just the channel , program plus and minus , and the just the mute button , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "real keep it really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one side for kids , one side for adults .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm not if that's like i'm not if it's good idea to have two sided remote though , 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or grandma as , it's like what is the mute button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , but you would slide it into someth like something on the back would hold like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons , but start breaking up .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like it like flip telephone , something like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was thinking that like flip .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "flip it open and you've got all the buttons , or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've got five minutes left .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'ve got we've got few ideas there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we should by the end of this meeting we should have at least rough conception stage one was technical functions design , what effect the apparatus should have .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , but the functions that we're that we want are that it can control the t_v_ , but also devices connected to the t_v_ , be able to operate d_v_d_ players , things like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have got we should also have back-up plan of 'cause think that it might be expensive to make something that we don't , we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we should have back-up plan of just really good television remote control , that just that is just for t_v_ , but it's just really good , one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what do you reckon ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see 'cause , i'm just thinking bearing in mind we've gotta we have to have something that's cheap to make .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's true , we should just concentrate on having good t_v_ remote , and have it be have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use , simple to use , and looks decent and sorta find niche for our remote , like market it to certain people , certain demographic , no you're .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we'll be able to come up with ideas and lot quicker .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "may , even or even so something that's for disabled people or so people that don't see very or big buttons for touchy buttons for .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it's just like .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or just one that looks really fucking .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "could be really light or , something special .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "rathe rather than focus on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "otherwise we'll be here all day talking about do this let's do that we sh we should .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause at the end of the day if it says just t_v_ remote , doesn't say com combination with all the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "everyone we're sounds like we're all bit gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once , but , that's .",

.", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "flip up thing , 'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this did anyway , like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the coach , and you'd come and sit down and , the telephone's the television switched on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so something that like does have lid or closes , so you don't accidentally press button or record button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but make it like really snazzy and people will want it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so make it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's gotta be sellable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's true what you were saying , it doesn't have to have flip function , it can just have lock function , so that it's not usable when you don't want it to be usable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and even for kids as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's safer for them , .",
