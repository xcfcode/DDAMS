[{"edus": [{"text": "'s to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your is , so in that sense so it does make sense , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're talking about action and design as opposed to background .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "everything have is kinda background .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we all ready to go ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how on the in this meeting then if we i'll just recap on the minutes from the last meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we decided on our target group being fifteen to thirty five , and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into those categories , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and told you about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the t_v_ , and trying to incorporate the corporate colour and slogan .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that was the last meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is there anything have forgotten anything ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that everything ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if we have the three presentations , and then if you have anything to that you're gonna want to discuss , just make note of it , and we'll have all the discussion at the end .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that might be better idea this time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so if we start off with andrew and then craig and then david , if that's alright .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then after that we'll have to make some decisions about , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if you wanna take this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "why don't get that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "screwed in quite tightly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what did how did we leave it with speech recognition now ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we did we say we were gonna try incorporate it but we hadn't made definite decision on that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "should also point out that the final objective of this meeting is to reach decision on the concepts of the product .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's the end result hopefully .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "alright so is it function eight ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "hopefully appear in wee second .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "up there we go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so let me just start this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so move on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "where'd it all go ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's not good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "lemme just see where find it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this looks more like it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "opened up the template .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright so let's have look here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this was the method that i've taken .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "here we go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what wanna do here , before we get into it too far , is want to show you all the background information have that we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then sorta go through some of the way that i've dealt with that information , and then bring us all together into it to see sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so i've tried to take whole lot of market research and summarise it for us , and then ide identify trends that are in sync and are important to our project plan that we have so far , and then initiate discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to narrow in on aspects that will inform other elements of the project .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "does that make sense , tha that strategy ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that will impact on the rest of what we do , so that's why suggested we get in this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "aye fair point definitely .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so out of different figures and ratings ob of people in general , consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that the br television remote control , fancy look and feel , and not , it specified , not functional look or feel , fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "however , this is where we kinda have to be very , creative about it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "number two was that it be innovative .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that tells me that we have to find way to be innovative without adding just unnecessary functional bits to it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and third priority for ease of use , so again that gives us general picture of how it has to be , quite user friendly while still having technology .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it i'll just say away as bit of foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of marketing , is that what we should think about is how the about how the innovation contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up , what , like , or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative because the thing that the message here is ease of use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so how do you make innovation make something more easy to use ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's where we're gonna go with this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then there's the other aspect of the back the market research have here is on fashion style , which as we've is priority .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "top european fashion trend that read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , especially in clothes and furniture .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and when first saw that , do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , or we get into it , or we completely steer away from it , do what ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so my feeling is that we do want to observe this trend , but we want to think also about the fact that it has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause what we're in what we're in is partly home decor , partly something like computer , so we might wanna be careful about how quickly we create like remote control in the shape of an apple , that would be pushing it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then in terms of material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and , you might say ergonomic or friendly to handle , which is which also in indicated that last year this was not the case .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so probably lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode , so if we try and really capitalise on that , that'll be in our favour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so these this is the summary of everything .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "style is number one thing in the market of who we're selling to .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "innovative design technology's also must in that it's seen it'd be seen to be cutting edge , but ease of use has to be insured throughout .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that was like the number three thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then at the end there are vibrant natural colours that's the way interpreted it anyway , softness in materials , shape , and function , and so i've written at the bottom to give us context of discussion , mac ipods , something which is , i'd have to say very high-tech , ten gigabytes , whatever , but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what mac ipod is ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's true , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm thinking however mac ipod is last year's because it's very hard and glassy and glossy , so i'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of mac ipod and we're then making it more of like more of like comfortable type of or more of like more vibrant to friendly thing to have .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then so this is with all that information what i'm suggesting in this slide here is that we take these ideas , and as we get into more the more techni like production side of things , that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like we think of some thin theme that unifies it all , that we agree on , sorta like marketing identity .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "does that make sense ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so like threw out few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , green colours , pe whatever , it's just an idea , 'cause i'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like the ones which i'm most fond of in terms of giving like theme to it would be like lemon like that , something which is , like you see lot in other areas .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and so anyway it's just an idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm thinking we could incorporate some of these features into fairly into something which is which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like something to do with like lighting within it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like just within the simple sense , when you pick up phone and touch button it lights up , usually the buttons light up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how can we build on that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like it could light up in different colours or people could buy the control and then it comes with different like covers so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "anyway those are that's all have , but hopefully we can revisit those ideas when we get into .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "craig do you wanna plug yours in then ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it working ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "did you press eight ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's probably not sending .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "something coming now , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there it is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so think of this concept .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to research it i've had look on the homepage again .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's provided me with more examples of previously existing remote controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there , so i've taken the suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this so then this we're looking for suggestions on size of control and the buttons , the shape of the control , and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what found from the research is that most the current controls are just big bricks with loads of buttons all over them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they're not very attractive to look at , and they're not very comfortable to hold , they're hold like big bricks , and they're very easily lost .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they tend to be very dark colours , so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you can't really see them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the controls themselves tend to use very inconsistent colour scheme .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the stand-by button isn't always red , it really should be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's something the user then identify with .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is red switch off , that's how it should be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm not if there's any other examples of that , but something to look out for .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's problem that i've got couple of preferences for the end control get with the red colour button for stand-by and the other examples of that the buttons should be large .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they shouldn't be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they should be easy to press , very comfortable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one of the examples given on the homepage was there's an up and down volume button but both of them have v_ on them , so the up volume button looks like it should be down volume button , that's kinda confusing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "should avoid things like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "trying to avoid being tacky there , but it could tie-in very easily with your lime and lemon idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do we have corporate colour scheme ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's yellow because like the website is yellow and there's band at the bottom is yellow , so yellow , lemon , definitely food for thought there , but keep going and we'll discuss it after .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the play-doh 's yellow .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be hidden , they shouldn't be on the shouldn't be visible without something be opened or some special extra effort .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we did decide to go for voice activation there sh should always be button as alternative , possibly hidden in the opened up section making that something is wrong with it or with somebody's voice , they got cold or we should definitely avoid the big square block look .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's just wrong .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we got an email from it's the research department , and they've said the voice control can now talk back if you ask it question .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it sh it could be good to have them confirm any action you take and possibility .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "aye that's good idea , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and these are problems i've had with it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "where the slogan should go , or really what the slogan is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's , fashion into electronics .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we how flexible the colour scheme is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you say you wanted the corporate colours , but they don't say if we can use any other colours or that's it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "lots of good information there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that was very good , and now with david .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's shame the cable wasn't just in the middle of the table , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "t'd be handy , wouldn't it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just it takes second , doesn't it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you wanna sit in the line of sight of this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let me just get this going first .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there it is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that should be it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the same thing again , started with something very basic .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so just so you have some idea of what's involved in my process , and then you can just work through it and we 'll either modify it or start from scratch depending on what your needs are .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the components are exactly the same .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like what you said , the most input that's needed is in the user interface .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the rest of the components they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like you said time to market was problem , and how many components are physically in there in cost .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the power is factor of that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , they affect you in terms of the size of your device , and that would have some inte impact on how more how you hold rather than the actual use using the remote control because like we've said we've defined , like we only want the basic things that to be visible , and the rest of them we try to hide .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's just matter of working out space .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so three things , cost , complexity , and the size .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "these are the three things that will have an impact on you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so just go through it in the components .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "these are the options that are available to you , i'm not very about the voice thing 'cause got another email and it was quite sketchy on what the voice options are .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it said something about sensor but never clarified that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if you could see the other email that they sent you , 'cause they got back to me with like different requirements , or different offerings of what components availa so your basic components are buttons , and you have wheel available , like mouse scroll wheel , there's an display , these are quite standard things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they're standard , aren't they ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no they're the sense that these are all the options available for you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again bit later .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then there's how the case actually looks .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it can actually be flat or it can be curved , and then the different types of materials that you can use , don't think you can use them in combination , but could check back for you , but don't think you can actually use them in combination .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we you couldn't have like plastic and rubber ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "plastic and rubber would be fine , but plastic , rubber , and wood , wasn't i'm not very about the titanium .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the rubber was restriction on the power source you could use , but the titanium had different things on the shape of the thing , so that there is some restriction on you could probably group plastic and rubber together , wood and titanium , but it might be easier from cost perspective and complexity just to use one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as opposed to two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the other components are logic chips , again i'll go back to the component chips .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the unit and that impacts cost .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't think the logic chip has issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "power consumption should be about the same .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the main impact is complexity , and the other thing is the power options .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the first one is standard battery .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the second one is more of gimmick then actually useable thing , it's wind-up , crank .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll clear one of these things for you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just by moving it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that might be something that's more of look and feel decision because don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "whatever it is you still need battery 'cause don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the other ones are solar powered cell , which may not be idea in europe or any country that has seasons 'cause half the year you'd be dead .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so like what said , you probably need like battery and something else .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the kinetic one for me is the most interesting one because it's movement and people like to fiddle with their and it's sales gimmick .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "from marketing gimmick it it's technology thing , it's shake it doesn't work , shake it , knock it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have you had those balls , those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it lights up and it goes , that might be gimmick combined with rubber .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just to if you get frustrated wi remote control you can throw it , just so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my from my role , don't think that personal preferences but role preferences , something comfortable to hold , small and slim that's more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you can't , like phone , too small phone .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the other thing is from production point of view the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the user interface restrictions means that if you use more complicated features , like the buttons are standard , the panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the case with rubber case you can't have the solar panels .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with the titanium case , let me just check that , titanium case can't be curved , it has to be square .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's no restriction on the plastic , and it can't be curved on the wood .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it can't be curved .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's again , don't think you can use them in combination , especially the titanium suspect they're very fixed to particular need .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so mixing them may not be good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can it's just i'm quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left so but you ask away .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "question on can ask question ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can we power light in this ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can we get strong enough battery to power light ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could because the panel requires power , and the is form of light so that are you thinking are you thinking of light in the sense of light , or light in the sense of it glows frankenstein , it's alive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so one of the things we can just try and include is really good battery .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "why what light do you want are you thinking of ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm thinking it might be that for this to be high-tech thing it's gonna have to have something high-tech about it and that's gonna take battery power , and to make that to make that realistic goal one of the issues that will come up later is , can the battery power it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "illuminate the buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm thinking along the lines of you're in the dark watching d_v_d_ and you find the thing in the dark and you go like this , and that's what everybody does .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "where's the volume button in the dark , and you just touch it , or you just pick it up , and it lights up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like phone , like the backlight in phone .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like phone , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "whereas with phones , people charge them once week .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're gonna need to put in really good battery so people don't have to charge their remote control every few days .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's why the option of the kinetic thing which means as long as you shake it like watch , like an automatic watch it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you could trigger that to light , like said the bouncing ball thing , or you could trigger that to use that to power the light as opposed to so when they pick it up , and then that sorta triggers the glowingness .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's just go back to the marketing ideas for start , and just giving an id idea on the time , we've got about fifteen minutes to play with at most .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so just to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an decision on the concepts of the product .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so back to your idea about incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg , and the corporate colour , and things like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what does everybody think about does anybody have any ideas of about how we can fit all that in together ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the user interface type of thing , what are your thoughts on that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could go for like not fruit shape but very curvy type shape .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you could have the same texture and colour as fruit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so do are we thinking something that like could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you you'd hold onto comfortably or so something quite curvy ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "probably something that sits in your hand comfortably , feels in your hand .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "colour-wise you made re was it you or 't remember who made the point about how if you've bright colour you'll not lose it , was that whose about how if you have bright colour you'll not lose it so much .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "he made that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and when the corporate colour is yellow , we could think about the colour of the whole product being yellow .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then the materials when it has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what might work ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that unifies lot of the different concepts , and if we think that what we are our number one marketing motive is the look and feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and pieces of concept and technology or whatever or fashion , then we should have it come back to one thing that we all sorta can visualize .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what we could do is think about concept which touches back to the on the colour , you said company colour yellow .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we think of something , like was saying also lime and lemon , what can we come up with something where we try and associate it with like the series .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we just come up with something like that we use it as theme to inspire the shapes and things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is there particular shape that you're interested in ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like does marketing have any research on does it need to be long ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does it need with square thing wha 'cause that will help narrow down the choice of like fruit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like in circular in shape or choice of material .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause was kinda thinking about as how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kinda feels it feels warmer to the touch .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm thinking fruits in my head , but that's tacky .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see i'm i'd quite like snowman type shape .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it feels bit more comfortable , and we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then we could have curved shapes , 'cause wood or titanium , it's gonna have to be boxy and rectangular and we might be moving away from that so 'm do we really want it in like the shape of lemon or no don't think we do either .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's more just that we think about like what it is we're trying to achieve , so and then we have one sorta theme that we stick with .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got another bubble at the top for just any other function you need .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's quite distinctive shape , that would be good wouldn't it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so should we go with that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can we like to and wha like do you have can you like just we can visualize it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you wanna draw it on the board ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "something like that you got two groups there it could fold up and you get third group inside or you have volume controls about there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that'd be good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so call it the snowman-shape trademark .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and colour-wise what does everybody think ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you want the whole thing yellow , like yellow and white do you want something .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so reckon it'd look quite if we just had this here , had sorta background yellow , and then have bold colour for the buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the fact that it talks to you , it might be quite if when you first start using it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or when you like or if you turn it off if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that might scare me .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "any thoughts on that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that'd probably scare me .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you turn it on your control possessed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "unless an if you also would that work if we wanted to incorporate an display , where would we put that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would we put that on the inside or it's bound to increase the cost of it lot , would've thought .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do we need an display ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what what's the functionality of that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the question is what are we using it what would we what would we achieve from it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what would it achieve ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "putting in lights is cheap but putting in an panel just to make it glow is bit of .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "l_c_ 'd when you used to mention the i'd wonder what that would be about .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the thing could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with listings .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can it actually tells you what it is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that will be problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it , so it's bit nuts to get the monday tuesday wednesday .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so no need for an display ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm not saying there's no need for an display , but it's what's what would it tell the user , 'cause the tends to be an output as opposed to an input so does the remote control need to talk back to the user ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would make it very complex .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have the option of the speaker as the sa the same thing goes for the speaker , is there need for the remote control to talk back ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if there is really , no would say no need for talk-back .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you could put game on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does anybody disagree with that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "when the t_v_ dies you can play with the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you're gonna have the three different sets of functionalities , do you wanna group them into head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , is that what you're thinking ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the advanced ones the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the we had were fairly basic ones , they'd have to go on the front somewhere .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what else do you need to talk about ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "where would you physically position the buttons ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that has some impact on many things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you wanna draw onto the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'm just gonna pop this in here 'cause have slide about decision making which i'd forgotten about .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "sh we've got five minutes back we go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "energy what do you think that's suggesting we're how we're powering the thing ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have kinetic power , what does anybody think about that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i've had kinetic things before , and the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it , and watches , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , like said we have hybrid thing , so it's not gonna charge the battery , it's just .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "support for it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just it's just worth pointing out because like i've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time , and it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i've also known people to have things like jewellery watch they wear from time to time , and they eventually just say it's just too much of nuisance because don't wear it all the time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like remote control is similar , you're away on vacation , whatever , you something , and it just starts to get worn down .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we should think about .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "suppose that if you're away and you're not using it , then you're not using any power either .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you'd have the battery as the to keep it ticking over idea i'm really we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly , we don't have as much time as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's what energy is referring to here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "chip on print , is that that's an industrial design thing , is it david ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as for the case , discussed that know we're gonna have like rubber buttons that feel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and this size here , i'd suggest this be small , like quite small .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just lot of the one of the things running through my mind now , realise we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made , but we are leaning quite bit to the side of being low-tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "should we think about how we are actually getting this high-tech user friendly theme like what is it that we're using to achieve those goals ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like so backlighting , that would be good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "could have things like backlighting the buttons and like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or even clear case .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable , but in the dark it , it's alive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "clear , that'd be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "aye that would be good idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in slight subtle way .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so like cur slightly transparent case , so it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can see through it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that'd be really good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is that what you mean ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or there might be light running through it like mouse .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have cordless mice and they don't eat that much power .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the power the battery in that sense , you have one or two stratig strategically placed lights that but because the case is transparent so it gives it little bit of glow , doesn't make it freaky .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they emanate light through it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then the other thing that we we're we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity , and so i'm thinking should we try and think about having something like some an innovative concept about how the volume and the channels are controlled , 'cause that's the main thing people will wanna do .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "could we use like jog dial , like just round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the question is when you're rolling it , how do you wanna roll it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you want to roll it like that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you want to roll it like that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause in mouse your hand's in position to roll it , whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you are holding it in your hand you could do that , couldn't you ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "why don't we do it like mouse then ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you're holding it in your hand you could do you think ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's very unnatural motion to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can you imagine you have to scroll lot .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it might work for volume , and some of the brightness controls and like that , but not for channels .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you have telewest box you've got like , you don't have to buy all the channels , you've about fifty channels , can you imagine trying to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and don't think having that too quick too slow kin it's confusing to the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then for skipping large amount of channels you do have to skip the channel button , the number part .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but users tend to want to use that and once they lose out on the user experience they're like because that's becomes the most accessible thing in front of .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that's not bad thing is it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just wouldn't it we do need to make decision on whether we want to incorporate jog dial in and quickly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because when you think about it , the alternative is to go push the button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "jog dials are much easier than that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you just roll .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm all for them actually , they're quite very quick to use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so does anybody oppose the idea of incorporating one into the design ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the other thing was can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like if we keep coming back to this board here , wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea , imagine that , that it's within the shape of the hand , it's quite small .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we really gotta wrap up so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's small , and that we've got like the slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side , and that isn't that what we just said we just have to decide now ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can do that , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let's try and get the slogan on there , and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then like jo and then like jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it like here , in with the it would get bumped , it's doesn't really fit with your hand .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you wanna expand the shape of the that might have one problem in terms of in terms of whether you're left handed or you're handed you might be locking yourself in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or just fit it in like down the middle here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "could jump in and suggest something quickly ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm gonna have to i'm really gonna have to hurry you on here 'cause we're actually over time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is there anything anybody's unsure about ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just for in closing just the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes , and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are gonna hopefully be doing , know that the designers are gonna be working with play-doh on that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that'll be good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and i'll get the minutes up as soon as possible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "anything you think we haven't discussed that we need to ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is everybody happy about what they're gonna be doing ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the jog dial , it just after you drew that , what if it was flat and you just spun it , that'd be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that's gonna have quite big impact on the thing that's what was thinking the slide , because then you don't have to put the hand .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "incorporating logo is quite straight forward .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's lots of space for it but it's also marketing and function .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's design thing that you can discuss , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", and materials we sorta said we'd do plastic and rubber , didn't we , and we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , 'cause that'd just be so standard .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to make something flush with the case ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "something bit more flush , or have rubber incorporated into the case as , so that it has and also plastic i've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "sp kinda grippy ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "feel like fruit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they feel like , you get pens now and then that you'd think that they were rubber but they're not , they're actually just plastic that's textured , little bit like .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "kinda like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm gonna have to i'm gonna have to call this to close 'cause we're way over time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's really good , like we've had much to talk about that run out of time to do so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so off you go and design wooh .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "quite jealous actually .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you got to choose first .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , we're kidding .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can swipe your power cable , don't matters .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "lemme , i'm gonna pull everybody out first and then put in whoever needs to be left .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is real hassle and .",
