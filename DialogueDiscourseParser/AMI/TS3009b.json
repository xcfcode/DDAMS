"A"}, {"text": "gave disc presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we said that we have to merge the strong points from our competitors , and look at their remote controls .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we should make it compatible with our new d_v_d_ and other releases we have ,

"this is it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm going to tell you something about functional requirements .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to start with these points .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "at first tell you something about what people dislike about the current controls , because it's smart thing to exclude those things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then tell something about the most important issues .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we have to focus on those three thing three things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and in the end i'll show you our target audience or our target product users , customers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the first findings are that people think most controls are very ug ugly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's seventy five per cent of the current users .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they don't like it , so we might think about fronts in that section .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they also say , that's about it was fifty per cent , that more money will be spent on better looking controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's very important that you design looking control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the current user uses his machine just about all of the time for few functions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "almost every user uses it the control for just ten per cent of its capacity .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's really important to make the buttons for the common tasks big or flashy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "furthermore , it's seventy five per cent of the users zaps lot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "thus it might be smart to make big zapping button in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can zap away .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "lot of losers users lose their controls in their living room .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it might be sensible to make some button on your television , that's your control beeps , that you can find this very easily .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's an idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "should actually it should actually be loose from the television , because it can also be used for other televisions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause it's big fifty per cent of the users loses his its control , within the same room .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so but what if you lose your click-on device ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if you deliver small click-on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no you can click it on your television .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if someone somebody else uses it in ano other room ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in another room , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "nee but it specifically says it's the control is lost in the same room .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so beeping device would be furthermore the learning time is problem .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'ll have look at it , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "thirty four per cent thinks it's too difficult to learn .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the learning curve should be very short for the dumbest people should be able to use it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "our user expert should also consider manual for the remote , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but people don't read manuals .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "didn't read it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "users to add one ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you think ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you should put more time in the design of pick up and use , than manual .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes you should could take look at it and know how it how it's supposed to work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because they don't use it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there sh should always be menu , but it can be very short .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it should be consistent with older remotes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but nobody reads manual about remote control , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for the if you don't recognise button who do call wh when it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it sh it should be there , the manual .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but not to explain how the remote works .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we don't have much time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's better to put our attention to the design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you can pick up and use it , than .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are design team , we can say to some writer make manual point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "isn't it part of the no .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so 'll have look .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's about twenty per cent .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the designer should take it should wie zeg ik dat ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "consider the consequences of using your remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it should be good in your hand .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is the most important part .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're like the requirements said , we're gonna specify of we're gonna target younger audience .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's about sixty per cent of the market , so it's quite important .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "research shows that they like to have little screen on their zapping device .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of the people like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ll with twelve euro fifty as production cost , we can't afford an .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's very important we should definitely have that in our designs .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's going to be expensive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but they t's really important .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if we want to if we have big if we make lots of the , we can buy it very cheap , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have to , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'ll consider it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's your task to look into the costs of those nigh know .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll think abo we'll think no , we'll look into that later .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't have any information on that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and another thing is speech recognition .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they also like that , but research is very costly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's difficult to realise also .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , but it might be important for the sale .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have very demanding clients .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's not yet standard development those so we sh .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no and we have customers in multiple countries .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do think is more reachable than the speech recognition .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we might consider screens .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'ll consider both and see what we can find , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we don't rule them out yet .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it is sensible to take this take these points into the notes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you can .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you still see your presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's in the next who is next .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you got yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "shall give technical talk ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it is my task to explain or to point out working design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have that here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how do you enlarge it , so that you can have the five .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the working design , that's my alright , who am and what do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we have this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's bit unclear because wanted to copy paste something .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it was originally in black and white but it became black and purple .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you can read it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's important for you to realise the basic function of remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can see and then can select on the dings it goes to the next page .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can select it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it inverts .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the whole picture .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "nah , never mind .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can read it , it's not too difficult .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "meanwhile , this is schematic view of how basic remote control works .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have the energy , the power of the remote control , and the sender , which is the led , the bulb that sends the infrared beam to the , no , to the set .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the source is the user .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the user interface is the buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the user interface sends the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , and the chip sends it to the led , and the led sends it to the receiver .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the basic idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have put it in couple of basic steps .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the remote is just waiting for user to press key .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it does nothing until the key is pressed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the key signal to chip , the chip senses the connection .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and recognise the key .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you understand .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the chip produces morse code , specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it uses transistors in the remote control to amplify and to send that signal again to the led , which is the bulb , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now the led produces an infrared beam and signals the , t's very simple , and signals the signals to the sensor on the t_v_ set , and the t_v_ set also recognises the signal , and performs the assigned task .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it is also why we have to have button that says i'm now busy with d_v_d_ if we had done that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and button for t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "bu , but we don't .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we no , but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so but if you have the most used buttons all in one place , and you keep making the same moves .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is the basic function of remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've some couple of pictures here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's very basic one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if we if we're going to add an screen to it , it won't look anything like this , but this is very basic the shape of remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it has very little buttons and but it it's quite , you can easily recognise the buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they're far enough apart and an anything .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's not very high-tech , and it's not very user-friendly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you look at the shape , it's just simple long box shape .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we have to change little bit to that , so that it becomes more user-friendly , and that problems like r_s_i_ and those kinds of thing don't oc don't occur .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can say something ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have table here about the relevance of the buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "teletext is not an option , so that but it's very important to make the power , channel and volume buttons near to the thumb , so you can't have r_s_i_ consequences .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because they are the most important buttons and you can immediately you don't have to look and search for them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "make them big , make them easy to press .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can also like , was thinking you can are some of the you can make , for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if you would put it at different place , then you have to move your hands , and that's on of the things about r_s_i_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can't have any every button under the thumb , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no but the most important buttons you can just put them bit apart so you would reject r_s_i_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's very important .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and but is that useable ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like some little gameboy things or some ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes i've saw that on mi mobile telephones they also have those buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do people , when they pick up remote , know that they have to do that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's new feature , you can make double feature like button on the top and under it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright , but if you say them up and down , they they'll understand it , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's also if someone puts picks up his remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "eighty per cent would .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if someone puts up picks up his remote , and he picks up it he touches the side then he's already on the next channel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "he feels it immediately .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's very irritating , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but in any case the basic function should be , and as you say at the thumb .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's good idea , and that the less important buttons , like the different channels , the numbers one two three four five as , should be not in reach , because they don't use it all the time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "t's pretty as you said .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and have some pictures of the inside workings , but don't want to get too technical , because that's not very useful for you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's your part of the job .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so exactly this is how it looks from the inside .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that's about it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "still have this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "had to delete this , but had to make schematic of the new but had too little time , but don't look at it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's clear how it works .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the most important thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then mike can give the third presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how late is did we start his presentation ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "about twenty minutes ago ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then we have still the time , so but we do have to come to decision , later on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "thought everybody on the website would see the same thing , but that's not the case .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there are different we have all have different home pages , with different links .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you couldn't see this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'m mike , user interface designer .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "used my own experience with remotes , took good look at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , these are from another manufacturer .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "these are already in use ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this one is engineering-centred , so this one has the most functions and things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this one is user-centred .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like user-centr centred also the best .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we also do that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that we reduce the option to control the d_v_d_ also , and teletext and that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we would use more or need more buttons than this one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we have to reject that , because of the requirements ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's why this is not relevant any more feel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is about the maximum number of buttons we'll need .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "kinda like the shape .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is what we talked about .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but no i've showed it somewhere .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can't really see the differ from different sides .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you can draw it if you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should go further with the idea of removable front .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we can customise the ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but they all have to have something about the recognition from our company .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we cannot just make someone no but that's the side they look at is the front .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not the whole remote that changes , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if you make front with just tiger on it , then our recognition is gone .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or you can put the same symbol on every remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so like ericsson does every something like this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we must have that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can put it on the back side .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can make symbol of the company here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if you put front on it , there's hole on the front .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the symbol's always on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that you don't replace the symbol , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "something like that , in the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but let's not focus on the front .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so like said we'd use more function .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we had to include more functions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we don't .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is about the maximum number of buttons we need .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like eject we don't need , and some other buttons we don't need .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "mike , can you put that picture from me on the in the word documents file ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for the remote less is more .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the less buttons the better the design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we should go with that concept .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i've got another point .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there are two target audi audiences , and we've chose for the younger one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "research has shown that it's high interested in features .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they are high interested in feature .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but they are more critical .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fo , critical .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the younger audience .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we must design control that really speaks to the people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what if we at home have remote that has the most familiar buttons on the top , and the bottom side of the front has little clip , little you can click away and then you have much more functions that most people don't use but some do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the most functions underneath that no usually but most .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "clip aren't used much .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but because you say they their features are important , they want lot , but not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but what features ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like screens and voice recognition .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but i've , that's .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "here , look at these numbers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the newest features are , like said , are and speech control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "our audience , these people , are very like these features .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we must build in something , or they will to go to the concurrent .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , do think we have to have some features .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "even though they cost little more .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could on some calculators you have lo those little that you can click on , or that you can click out of the remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if that's gives you little bit of sta status information .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which programme you are watching .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "those things , because you also have those program recognition for your v_ v_c_r_s .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if your remote picks that up also , you they can display which programme you're currently watching .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it just signals the different sig the different symbols on the screen you have , because if you change to channel two you have two on the screen and two on your screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it could be such little that you can click in and out and you have it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we should keep that simple too .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but should it really be clickable , or just integrate inside to try to make it more trendy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it will no , it should be integrated .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no not clickable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "nah , no .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "something like on some radios in car .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just at the top .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so when you sit like this you can watch .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it should be at the top .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you where it's , walking to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's ticker-tape idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that's bit more expensive than the basic calculator design , with the scrolling text and that thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "t's just one script .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's you got it just means it's script that's keeps it rolling , and it's not that's five minutes off implementing time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "five minutes of ja for programming .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so don't think that's the issue .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright , we go with the screen ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we still need to know how much that will cost .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're no but we're we'll have to look into that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if find that , but next time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or you will get that information .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can use this board again , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can put some decisions about the controls we want , the issue .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "where is my presentation ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're all here now , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "understand what you're saying .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we should have general idea of how it's gonna look .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these i've already given you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we have to decide on the different remote control functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we want to have small screen that's special .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "at the top .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "shouldn't we start with the most important parts ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "at the top or at the bottom ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the screen alright but we should start with the power button ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the top is more when you how do you zap ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but with the screen on the top it gets bit unnatural .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you just sit in your chair ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "with the remote ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that thing is terrible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that's where your hand ball might be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "mike has point , because when use remote hate the buttons but buttons at the bottom .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we should centralise the discussion here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we'll draw two , and then we'll see no he thinks , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what you were talking about but we are busy with something .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "he thinks it's better to put the at the bottom , and it's better at the top .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "why do you t's better at the bottom ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because most remotes have some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you just can put the whole interface bit down , so that there's room for the interface .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's ugly but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the ticker the is like small .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's not high .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we can bottom .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "power button always .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so and like to use the ones on the top .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you gotta zap like this or you want to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so when have to have an scr window yes but we don't want that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we're making remote with few functions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's bit exaggerated .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "agree with you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's also more recognisable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it looks more like calculator to people , if you have the thing on top .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you don't want you want it must be remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we don't want them to look like calculator .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we want to look it like our original but familiar yea bic better white we white ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you don't have to throw important aspe important aspect like familiarity completely away , because it's still important to have it at the top , because it's more familiar that way .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's not problem .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "when draw here it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's bit off .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it needs to be calibrated again .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's talk about that later it's special pen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you should another pen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you only have one pen for that screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "alright , we have to make decision now , because we don't have much time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have few functions , and we can put the above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it should be at the button , bottom .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'m the i'm the designer , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "at the bottom ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in few minutes , agree .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "at the bot so we are two v_s_ two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but what if we first decide the different functions , and then look at the design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "he's the boss .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we were busy with that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because we have to decide this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we should summon the different aspects of the thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , we have the power button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and moreover that you two should be come to consensus about the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's your job .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no it's our job .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have power button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wh while you have to agree , say it's like this and you must agree .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for all of us .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "alright , let's keep it central .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have power button , setting buttons , window , the number buttons yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the ten numbers ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let's look at your design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the mute button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "love that one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we should use something like this to the channel up and channel down button ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in circle , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's also design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and volume control also in it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but on this remote these controls are else , d_v_d_ player .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , as already said , we could drop some of these buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they are for some video apart .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you should put that power button , channel and volume should have the most importance .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these should be in one big circle in the middle .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but what he said about r_s_i_ was kinda true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "when you put them all in the same place , the most used buttons , you're doing the same thing all the time , and that's just what r_s_i_'s all about .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it might be smarter to put them little more away from each other .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so people have to move their hand .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and they get less complaints of r_s_i_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's what always do , because all my important buttons are the same place .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's good to move from time to time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "frequency of button use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they need to be centred .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no but now would we have to choose way in middle ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "channels are most is most used within the hour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can see .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the channel buttons should be far apart , up and down .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no don't think .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "up and down far apart from each other ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you thinking about r_s_i_ ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not too much .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "look at the frequency .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "nei not too much , but nei agree .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the other two frustrations are far more important .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so they are used four times an hour , so power bu button should be left at the top .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you don't have to have volume control and zapping button close together .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the power button , you can if someone is constantly zapping , it's not going to miss , that it that the power button is not beside it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because have someone but the buttons is way .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that one can be put away .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the power button can be yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and should be red .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "man , five minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "five minutes left .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just make some decisions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the most important things we have to do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how are we going to do it with those numbers ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can you make we can use the drawing board now , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it doesn't work but it would be pretty if we could just draw simple thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have it here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's going to take too much time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just you decide that , you decide that , and ready .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you are industrial , you are user interface .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's going to go to mike .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you will have to make consensus with .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "t's bit hard , because we are going to be individually .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "consensus , we can put it in the middle , so alright .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're no we're deciding now , so top or bottom ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's bit yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "still t's it's quite important though to have it at the top , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes it is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you say familiarity isn't important but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what if we're going to now decide about the functions , and the design comes into the next round ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "plus the design round is still to come ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright these functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as we , we do have .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the number yes , that's alright .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's enough .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the number function .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are we going to do it like on mike's screen with one button that says i'm going to do two number digital ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how do you want it to do then ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's one two three four five six seven eight nine zero .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just when you push one and no , if you on most t_v_s if you press two numbers shortly after each other , it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it has to recognise one as there could still come more .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they'd recognise it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the most that that's very easy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "alright so no button for that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "anyone any oth other functionalities of our remote ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "these are the most important functions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you still have the pictures over there ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so no , we'd just said we didn't because we can't integrate it with any other remotes , all those buttons on those pictures are irrelevant .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's about it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you do need the multi or did no , like this one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you do need them ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but are we alright , alright now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so just for television is we need ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's most useable this way .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "teletext is gone .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so all those buttons that ar are to do with teletext screen placing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll have those buttons about and the two important ones we're forgetting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can make it wider and less wide .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the button that you can go to a_v_ for your video .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do think we have to put that underneath clip .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's just two , and we make clip ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just two under but you can put two or three buttons under another section .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's bit waste .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can make little row of like four buttons down here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or at the top .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "your screen is going to go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or at then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's too complicated .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can just put it somewhere they aren't used much , not as much as those other , so you can put it somewhere bit smaller and more at the bottom .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they should in an isolated part of the remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they can be small or round like buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or at the top , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what do you think those buttons ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "above or down ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "design it later .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have it , and we design later where everything goes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "any other go to video , that's always on your remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you take those if you , but you can zap you can zap to the video channel from zero to , but when you zap down zero you get to a_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "why go to video ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the video channel ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's just zero .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no not at my remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no not always .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ze zero is different channel than the video channel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you can zap down yes , no , then you press ninety nine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "go to ninety-nine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "go to video is an irrelevant button , but you must have .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the button no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it's easy to go if you are at channel fifty five and you want to go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push to get below zero .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no you can ch push zero .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's more easy to get to where the specific video channel button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that one button is use it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if we're choosing to incorporate these buttons , you have to have channel setting , if you wa if you have new t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you have to set the channels .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "all these different buttons you have to , do .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these buttons , don't have buttons for channel setting especially on my remote
