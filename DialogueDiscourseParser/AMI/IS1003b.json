"the first will present the technical function design for user interface for our remote t_v_ control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "will focus on user interface design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so move to the next slide .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as we know our remote rem remote t_v_ control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there's lot of functions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "over , over twelve or twenty functions of remote t_v_ control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so how can we design user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's move to next slide .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we want to design elegant , easy to use inter interface .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "very good example is google .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as we know google it's very successful because his powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so move to next slide .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so my job is to design google t_v_ controller which want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's the end of the talk the end of the presentation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you propose to have the remote control which will be powerful .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "with sophisticated functions , but with very powerful .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so powerful , many functions and very easy to use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , it's difficult to have both , the one on the doesn't look so simple and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to merge the two system .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you mean this one ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have to learn the manual before using this remote control , suppose .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but this is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if we have very good user interface it take less time for user to learn how to use it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you have some international standards , where , if you can use one is the other are or almost the same , so the sign .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you mean for the pic pictograms or things like that ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "here , escape , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , that it should be the same .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it should , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you have to the sh the user there the power off button it is something very international , that so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the user should know .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "such as the go on , go back and so , you will propose us something which is so powerful and easy to use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the question is how to merge the google system to the system , alright .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's gonna be the trick .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's my job .",

and easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's the point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's the point .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , next propose the industrial user interface to present things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you you're .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the rationale must be design , or so we can move to the next slide .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , baba is the industrial designer .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as you all know , my job is to design to give an industrial design of the remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the re the remote control will be , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the how to relate the remote control device , like this one i'm holding in my hand and the t_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , this one is leather bu based but propose nifra infrared base , so for me that it is better it's bet it's better to control t_v_ so , so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , for the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to it's cheaper than laser , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you mean that infrared control is cheap technology ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do the requirements for the remote control ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "twelve , nearly thirteen , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what the cost is ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for the cost we want for the cost we want it's better to have let's see .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "twelve , twelve half .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can move to the next slide , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the di the differen the findings what you find inside the re the system here inside it is just , bulb and an infrared bulb , so here the infrared bulb will be here and the bulb it will be somewhere inside .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that might just so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can go to the next slide .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have some pictures , here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have the bulb , it is blue the blue here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what is this ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but here what wanted to emphasise it is just the bulb and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so and the next slide , it is the last one it's so it's it should be wire wireless re remote con because , it's easier to manage and because you the battery problem can hold will you use battery or the wire to connected you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or some thing that we can have both , but , at my side prefer wireless .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if you have some question didn't answer ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what's the average price of this technology then ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the avera the average prices that this technology will cost , around eight euros , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or at least , the you'd yes , you can .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what , the wireless remote control ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there's wire with remote control ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's so bres you have to decide how you will , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or it's question that we can raise , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can think that , with the wire , without wire .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can have both also .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you think that cable between the remote control and the t_v_ won't be good idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no it wou it will be cheaper , may you making solu , but as industrial designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but this is what you would like to ask the user first and don't think the user would be ready to have don't think , don't think he would , but in sense the wire ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wireless remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but some pa always want to have , sometime want to have wire because .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm just asking you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you will be cheaper ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't will be too much .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "could you answer ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have to think about the question , 'cause it's that you can always wha with the wire it's cheaper but the wireless it's more practical , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the wireless problem is more the david jordan's problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's more your problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "mayb you have just to research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's my job .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's the now the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so just think of the usability .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , it should be an agreement , because even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the graphical user designer , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it is lot cheaper and if you want to reach some the money you have , if you want to use , so it can be good to have wireless , it is question .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "design wireless remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just think of the problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's would be easier to have link between the remote control and the television , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's actually one of the point , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this you will see in my presentation then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so will let you to do your presentation , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which is participant four .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something else .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've made study , so could you go to next slide .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for the functional recurrence .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's the standard method for marketing , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we had one hundred subjects , we observe their remote control use in lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up questionnaire , and see what was or not for them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually seventy five percent of the users find the most remote controls ugly , so that's , the look is bad for them so it's your job , david , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you mean the loo the look , the outside ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the look , how it look like .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then eighty percent of users would spend more money actually if the remote controls were not so ugly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is where we could have , good market , if people are ready to pay more .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's interesting information , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we should change this as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and users are actually zapping lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and this is one of the main point for me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but i'll come back to it later .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "could you go next slide ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so as you said , remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is from the experiments we've done , so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and remote control are really bad for r_s_i_ problems for twenty six percent of the users .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what is r_s_i_ ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "r_s_i_ is like , when you're using the same doing the same movement several times , then you get injured .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so last slide .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our concurrent , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and definitely if it could have less buttons , still the same number of functions , but less buttons , this would definitely be good way of selling more .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , remember the user is not happy to read the manual .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and just to have an idea , do you think you as the user interface designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you t's possible ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because we can mix several function in one button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so lets you then you have less buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but do you will be easy to use ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but i'm not no you can have switch menu , so you can , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the , but it has to be intuitive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like for you can category the function into several classes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then for you can have switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it tend to this category of functions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then you put the switch button , then it switch to another category of functions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you have remote control you can rem you can control your t_v_ and also you can control your recorder .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "with look fancy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so there's different functions , but if you there's button you can switch between control t_v_ and control your recorder .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we can has less buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but what i'm not so is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy , not funny .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is question that should be asked to the if you ask the people , the marketing people .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because different people have different opinion about fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is something we sh but this was first step and this was the first step , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because colourful is fancy for some people , but simple and uniform colourful is fancy for some for other peoples , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the solution is to have many colours of instead of having one grey standard , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it will increase the price of the production of the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "specially distribution , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but this is what we would ask to the users , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because , because some people prefer red remote control , some people prefer black remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it will cost little bit more .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also , but as soon as you speak about options , it means that the price increases , and we don't really want the price to be too high , because we wanna be able to produce it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can have di we can have several options , so user can select which colour they prefer , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "remember it's twelve euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , we want something fancy , as previously said , florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap lot .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control , they want to zap between channels on t_v_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you have quite lot of points to think about and to discuss it with the other members .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , is it for your presentation ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "nothing else to add ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's done , just .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we would if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , it would make it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the first one is that for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it's something that's it's is no , because now everybody has internet at home , so it's better to use internet then teletext .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "lame , or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , you will have to think about it in your in the design of your remote control , and also the remote control will only be used for television , so for you your designing , you're not you won't be you won't had buttons to just to manipulate to control the recorder or the garage door or things like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's because if we want to do remote control which will be used for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we really want to focus on the remote control for the television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but there's balance between function and the cost .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it will be easier for you to design it , to have very powerful and easy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also we want the image of the real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and the slogan .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's if you want to buy remote control and if you go in shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that it's our product .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you will have to use the colour of the product , of the of real reaction and also .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so has to be yellow .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be fashion remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "require lot of requirements , but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for cheap remote control , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that's your job to find something matches .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause what i'm thinking is how will you will connect the t_v_ to internet , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is , but this mean that your t_v_ would be able to , connect to internet , surf the web .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't t's part of the remote control design anyway .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not , but mayb so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's more in browsing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's that box in of it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "pi there's that box in the t_v_ , so with the set box you can connect internet with your t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's not so popular now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's pop don't t's popular , so that's the problem so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you had if you are designing remote control for the global usage , so if people don't have the technology .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so everybody is with the new requirements ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so as for the colour , what do you think ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it has to be yellow .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you think that people like the colour yellow ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "t_v_ remote control ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can change the colour , but the image of the society has to be recognised .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you have like yellow ribbon here is the double .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "why you go it has to be fashion .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or should be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "doesn't need to be completely yellow , but just .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you have to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it has to be fashion and really be the image of the society .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just when you enter you say , it's real reaction .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "t's re reaction remote control , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also it has to be attractive , because if you want to sale to sell the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "regarding the first line , what so we're just expecting no more use of the teletext .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , but why , nobody's threat to me .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's already changed for .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it would be simpler .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so will close the meeting , just after that we'll have lunch break .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you will have in thirty minutes individual work .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you will have as the i_d_ don't remember what is industr industrial designer to put pon , and the user interface designer to work on the user interface concept .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "industrial designer , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and florent to work my subject .", "speaker": "C"},
