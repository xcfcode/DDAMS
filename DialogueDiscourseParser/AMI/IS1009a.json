.", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "project plan , that falls under the same heading .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't think we have any discussion at this point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here is what this thing should be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this thing we are gonna design is new remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should be original , trendy , and , user friendly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you wanna make some notes of that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what we have come up with .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the same goes for the conceptual design , there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "detailed design , same thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so three different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with .",

'cause don't like snakes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "here's the project finance which , we all have to think about when we design this thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "selling price is supposed to be twenty five euro .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "profit aim for the company is fifty million euro , the market range unlimited meaning international and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty euro .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so these are all things , to remember with the budget and when you design to materials , cost , etcetera .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now , the discussion is does anyone of you have experience with remote control ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", using remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "exp 'cause we use , everyday .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and now having used remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would you like it to be smaller , bigger , have more buttons on it or clearly better marked buttons , things like that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , feel the remote should be very compact .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "those which we get here nowadays it's very long .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it should have multi-purpose .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like the remote control which we use for t_v_ , it shou it should be used for some other purpose also , like controlling the temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners , or for heating system .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it should be multi-functional gadget that would control all your household machines .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , exactly yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "at twelve fifty euros per who knows if we get really good designer we can do that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we certainly can try to agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it should be something new it should be it should do something different than just what we have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now , the other thing to think there is the design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "design should be , it should be different .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "all the almost all the remotes yes , exactly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like trendy no like for earlier we saw it should be something trendy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ten do , colours and al shapes also .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it should different colours or materials or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are different shapes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so shapes , like kidney shape feels better in your hand , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "friendly shape , that would help .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "another thing that would help is if it beeps when you clap , because one of the big things that happens is people lose them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they can't find it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that is true , because they put newspaper or they put it behind plant or , we , whatever .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and they suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the t_v_ off and they say , where the hell is my remote control ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so some so , so it's really the beep or , or light should blink .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or if it's really , if it's really in dark spot that it gives out sound or signal .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "some beep like that , so that we can go .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or should ha fluorescent signal , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if lost signal with throw signal , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it should have light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "exactly , just that's what i'm saying .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "may not be beep .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's beep or whether light or , my idea is that the minute it's really hidden , in other words if it's like in dark spot , meaning like newspaper is on top , sweater is on top or it it's behind plant , at that moment it's like , it's like , what you call it light sensors , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "beep or it's light , it's light .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and do you think good clue for that is that it would respond to clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what should you have to do to make it beep or blink ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in that moment it has sensor , it gets certain darkness , it ge has sensor and it gives out signal whether that be light signal or beep , that we can discuss that later , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "probably , probably it's , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the light sensor would activate the signal .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there would be you have to have some sensor and voice or clapping it's not specific enough .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "know there are the lamps and , you can clap on and off , but they only work to certain degree and what with , but then those people we can't help everybody .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", that didn't we can't do it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because you're silly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then , in that case yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because people are silly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it could be on , if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table , we have to move along , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have , we have to move along , but we have some good points to start with here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the next meeting will be in thirty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you all did you get notices on your computer for this ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , you got the notice .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the working design , that's the function i_d_ who is this ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the industrial designer that's you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's functional de , exactly , technical .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , we looking for working design when we come back .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "working design , it's mainly technical-functional design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then and then the technical funct you are the technical function , so you are the working design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "functional design , and you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you have working design and then functional design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification , like friendliness , and what we just discussed in general .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would be your idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , price .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that it , that it , that the price is good price .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the price is given , but , that was .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , specifi you will get specific instructions for that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's the end of the show .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we have , we have twen two three minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "any questions at this point ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions , you can .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have enough to think about 'til our next meeting .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how about you people ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "even have , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "alright , very good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so let's see .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then we see you in about thirty minutes .",
