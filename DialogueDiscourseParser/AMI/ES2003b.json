asked some open ended questions , just , what are your opinions on the remote control , got lot of re responses , and we asked some very specific questions , and we got lot of good feedback .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "bear in mind this is only hundred people , so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , there's only ten people fifteen people in each group .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we got some the bad we got , remotes are often lost .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "often lose my remote control , the back of the couch , some place , and even if it's not lost permanently , it takes me few minutes to find it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "most buttons are not used any more , like you said , teletext is outdated now .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "remember trying to load d_v_d_ player recently , and there were so many buttons , it took me ten minutes to go through each button , 'cause you have to press the shift

just not to use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we just got lot of bad complaints about remote controls , people do not like remote controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "some of the good we got .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "between the age of fifteen and twenty five , most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now don't get excited yet , i've got more to say on that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "most people'd be willing to pay for that most people want remote controls to be pretty , they want it to be fancy , they want it to be different , everybody has white remote control with black buttons , and red button and green button , not everybody wants that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "finally , my opinion .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the voice recognition thing is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and voice recognition , the software , open source software exist already .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's bit sketchy at some times , you're not gonna get good always accurate results , but for very fixed number of words , you have , how many different words can you have for remote control , up , down , left , channel five , channel seven , how many , you can't have that many words .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for fixed vocabulary it works quite .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm pretty people would buy it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but after while people may wanna return it , because if you have to say som most people use remote control for switching to channels , and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "using the remote control , ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels , and that's for flickering through channels .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if you have to say up , if you have to do the time , then people might get bit fed up with that and they may return it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "however , because the voice recognition software exists already , there's no need to spend money on research and development , but this does mean the need for microphones in the remote control , which is an unusual feature in my opinion .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if we do have the voice recognition thing , there's lot of that you can get rid of .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "see , you could there're two options .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "either you have voice recognition by itself , which is bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet , or you have visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you , it's bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you can have voice recognition and regular remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but imagine you got rid of the regular remote part , then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look , because there are no restrictions on physical size , or shape , it could be as fancy as you want it to be , it could be like lollipop like that , something weird like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as long as the voice recognition works , that's fine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we have the three birds , we have the design , that we have the fancy bit , the voice recognition's fancy , it's different , it's radical , so , and then we have an extra bit don't remember so i'm pretty people will buy the remote , but is it practical to have voice recognition system in remote control , is big question .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "will people be willing to for the period that it'll take to train the remote , 'cause it will the remote will get better over time with the same user , but for the first week or for the first two weeks are you willing to , are you willing to have bad remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and what if you have visitors come round , they stay the night , they wanna use the t_v_ , they can't use the remote because they speak differently to you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how do you account for regional accents and like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "will people return the remote control , lot of young people will buy the remote control , if they have the money , so , do our audience have the money , but would they return it after while because it's not as fast as pressing button , it's not practical .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you could sor if you could speed it up bit , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "these are things we should consider .", "speaker":

some considerations .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "hear from the user interface designer now might be an idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you've got your presentation now , is it on the is it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how did where did you get all your in information ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's in the it's in the folder .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there was website , here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "started making up , then got an email saying .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is brief run through of the technical functions of the remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as is the presentation is already slightly obsolete because had in mind something that would be aimed at controlling multiple devices but there's still of relevance , so press on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i've looked at num couple of other remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and wasn't really satisfied by what saw have to say so this is more springboard for how these could be improved on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance , in this case the television set .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to save you getting off your backside .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and there's two main trends in the design practice .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "on the one hand and this particularly relates to its earliest models where with so many buttons on it so about the size of the television set .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "giving you every possible function that the device has , the remote control controls .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and most of these functions are not going to be used , it creates rather user unfriendly interface .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and on the other hand there's user focused approach that pares things down to just what is most likely to get used .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with and there is certain amount of loss of function here , but mostly that's relatively peripheral functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so you go that's fairly intuitive to use , and the for the most part for t_v_ remote it's tha that would be channel control and volume .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if you are wanting to incorporate control of d_v_ d_v_d_ or v_c_r_ presumably into that then there's play , pause , stop , rewind , fast-forward , record , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my own view is that we should definitely be going for user focused design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the pro the problem with lot of the user focused designs that are about is that they make assumptions in advance about what given user's going to want mo want to do from want it to do most .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , something that's something that is more programmable , that perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that those are then immediately accessible through fairly minimal number of controls , liked ebenezer's idea of including joystick in that and possibly fairly minimal number of function buttons , and have disp you then have some basic display on it so that if you're cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what each direction of the joystick's going to do or wha or what each function button's going to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is actually again slightly taking inspiration off of games controllers , the playstation control where you have four basic function buttons that are just marked with distinctive geometrical shapes but the and then dependent on what you're doing with it what game and so on those functions are then further specified .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so it's taking the lead from that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we could hear from our industrial engineer , or designer .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was still working on , hadn't got it finished .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "click to save in where do have to save it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you look on the desktop you'll find that there's link to the project folder , or project documents .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you save it in there we can open it up from here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what i've done with it , i'm .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm just closing it now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are you finding it or ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "where i've saved it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like if you go to one , whichever one you were working , and you just click file save as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's it there , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm responsible for working design , this is the inside going on of the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we have the energy source , we have the user interface , this is what i've seen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the sender will push the button , the chip will respond , and then the dig digital signal is sent to the t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , if you go to next slide , you'll see what do we need on the user interface .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do we need many buttons , or do we need many light bulbs that could be easier to realise which appliances are on or not .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", or would that take too much power , would we need more components in there to supply the power ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the joystick is another thing , if we were gonna add that , there'd be more components to deal with that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we need to exactly what that's the design of the layout of the electronic design , but there'll be more details once we've decided what we're putting on the user interface .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , that'll be decided , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the next slide .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", if you go to the next slide then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "used the it was mess , was just putting adding it together at the end there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't worry about it mate .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you have the energy source connected to the chip , and the user interface contains everything .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you have the switch turn it on , infrared bulb , will contact the t_v_ and will have whatever device or d_v_d_ player , the bulb will turn on to say it's on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so do we need on the control different buttons to decide , or different light bulbs , would it be easier ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what we should decide on that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm interrupting you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "are you is it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , it's finished , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can probably skip that for now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , we've had some put forward , along with the new user requirements , we've had lot of input i'd say so far .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "hear what the marketing expert's saying about voice activated control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "however i've got couple of worries about that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the power required , and the ability to the cost , it seems like for an embedded system , this could us issues .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you see that there's fairly robust services on computers via voice , i_b_m_ do drag and dictate , but these require lot of memory and usually state quite advanced processor requirements .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "voice activation could be an interesting idea but that our ind industrial designer would probably upon some research say that it's not feasible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's just my view now , however the idea of joystick and then an which has been put forward so far , it's almost like having small t_ not t_v_ to say , but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display , how much power an would take , but it might be quite low ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "on the remote just telling you what's on , or , interactive or do you think that people will get mixed up , like , they'll be looking at this screen and that screen and then , trying to get everything working , would it be bit confusing ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "literally if you can imagine the display slightly larger than those on mobile phone , something where you can read an fair amount of information , traverse quite few menus , if we used mobile phones as good example , they usually incorporate they have the keypad , and then evr all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that could be one possibility .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say , volume control , changing channels we would agree with you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was thinking that the remote the default functions for the joystick would be up and down for volume , left and for channels .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "probably for the first couple of hours of using it but muscle memory's wonderful thing , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that size of display was about what had in mind .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "though would say that we could probably be required to mo most of the mobile phone displays you see these days are colour but we should probably try to stick to black and white .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "si simply to keep the unit cost down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "colour could be subsequent development but cost bit of extra money once everyone's got the first , colour's out , we'll have to replace it won't we .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it does nothing extra .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would be my feeling as , we could possibly create quite useful user interface .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now don't , go for it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the idea of remote with menu or and joystick like if was in the habit of buying remote controls then would want one , but we don't have specific audience , like what is our target audience , what niche are we trying to market and corner .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what i'm saying , like , for whom is this intended ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it could probably be aimed at most people who've used mobile .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that might be just another way of saying try to target most people .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "most people , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we are if we were to follow that avenue , we might be we're almost relying on their experience with mobile phone suppose .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that does cover very large section of the people out there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "imagine as that the actual and to certain extent the joystick as would be for the additional functionality .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which doesn't get used as often , it makes it easy for them to figure out how to change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you can still have the main buttons thow the people to turn the machine on and off , up and down , it depends , we have the fol the joystick as separate one for the other functions then , that there's just small number of as you were saying buttons that have already been defined .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so like we go for the standard up and down for and volume control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that literally anybody can come along , pick up the remote and still do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and they can completely ignore most of the functionality which would be for say the actual owner of the t_v_ and who would normally use the unit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the thing like about the joystick is that you then you can then put it for t_ for t_v_ remote alone , you could put there are like say the main things people do with t_v_ remote control is the volume and the channel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can pack all that onto was onto single control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the but then if you wanted to access further functions you then get to menu navigation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with things like ch with things like tuning and channels adjusting brightn brightness and fiddly things that no one really bothers with , most t_v_s these days actually have menus anyway so this would be fairly rational way of integra integrating the remote with the device it's controlling .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "concern about our market .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we are most of the replacement remote market is remote control rationalisation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you've got twenty different devices in your living room , you want one you want one that'll do the job of all of them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if all you're replacing is one of the however many remotes you have in your living room , you still need separate remotes for everything else .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "think that possibly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is requirement that we have to stick to i'm afraid , this isn't one that i've just arbitrarily decided on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is one of the solid ones that has to be obeyed , for now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so understand your point , and would agree with you , but this is our design spec for now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'fraid to say .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would say so , yes , because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes , and that is separate unit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "does that would that include access to say interactive functions on digital or cable ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that it would say that the design spec we've been with is for the television only for now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and until we hear otherwise we should go with just that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we'll hear differently , but for now it would be ease of manipulation of certain functions , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the joystick is just for differentness .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there is that possibility , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then our market should be t_v_ manufacturers , rather than the public .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "try and sell it to them to supply with , i've seen them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "however exactly where we'll be going with that , but it might not even be the avenue of the marketing expert , that might be sales , who are not in this meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's just , the way figure it , twelve point five euros per unit , we have to sell at least like three million like that , not to account for all the money we waste on remotes that no one buys , like if we made perf if we made ks for every remote we made someone bought it , then we have to sell lot of remote controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we just is this gonna be enough to sell ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "something else that you brought up was the ability to lose remote , which as you said you've done , we've probably all done .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it's gimmick or not , but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle , it will beep and you tell you where it is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "had one of those , and my brother , and my dad , could have beat me up because it went off all the time accidentally .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the other option is that the was going to say clapping , digital telephones , one unit has you have to have that base unit , somewhere where there's button , but it's button that you attach to the t_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the clapping one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "something which you when you press that , it would beep to give its location away , on the remote unit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that could be something could separate us bit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's good idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that way , because we're attaching what would be small button to the t_v_ , again say what , it would be small transmitter , watch battery type scenario would say , that if it was problems enough you could actually even just don't power that might be something that we could look into .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're just saying volume .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's putting lot on your shoulders there , so that could be something that separates us bit from the market as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to go on from here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "before we leave this meeting , it would be best to say this is what we're going this is the design we're gonna try and get , this is how we're gonna make ourselves look unique .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do we go for remote contro , we're gonna go for remote control , do we go for small joystick that would operate say changing channels , up and down , and then , what , another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "should volume be important in the joystick , do you think ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could use say the left and for changing channels and the up and down for volume , and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we have frequency of how what people use remote control for most .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "power is used like once per hour , channel selection is used hundred and sixty eight per hour , that's by far the biggest one , and then teletext , is still here , that's like fourteen , and volume selection .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "vol volume selection , the teletext we're gambling with , and we're gonna say it's dead , the way of the dodo so we , we could even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , and then what is it one more button to say that you're using the menu system , and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we're having very few buttons involved , but navigation around menu for most things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "actually how actually would say two function buttons , the we're now using the menus button and an og and an button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "certainly something i've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that lot of the time the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or vice versa .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's really irritating .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the other dis design constraint we should bear in mind is that people are very much used to using remote control one handedly , so we need to make that even with the joystick , something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand and have the joystick just controlled by the thumb .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're actually that sounds like rough idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do we incorporate the idea of trying to locate the remote control again via beeping noise ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you mind looking ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because it's so small it might be an if we only have like two three buttons it might be essential to have that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the ability to locate it again .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that would require transmitter attached to the t_v_ , just so that it says find me , and what , small microphone on the actual unit , can hide it in the base .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "light bulb as , no ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so small speaker you mean .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "some speaker , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and light bulb ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "us we might be better with the sound possibly we could incorporate the true fact , considering the cost of an l_e_d_ , we could just incorporate it anyway .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "nah , you'd see it anyway , if you hear it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "those little key-rings have both , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the l_e_d_s can be surprisingly bright now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "blue ones particularly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "plus that's wee design touch .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so by the sounds of it , with what we're suggesting so far , your design the user interface is still quite open , you could go for quite an interesting design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because we're only going to have very few key and you've got small , joystick , it leaves you open to potential wide range of shapes , something that can make it stand out slightly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you could look into what we've suggested so far , the feasibility of small transmitter , and such , if an screen requires too much power , or such .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ebenezer , marketing expert if , if you could as see what people think about the idea of this minimalist approach that we've taken ,
