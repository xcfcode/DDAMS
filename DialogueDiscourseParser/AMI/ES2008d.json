[{"edus": [{"text": "welcome to our detailed design meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm pretty excited .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's start it's approximately fifteen forty like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll look at the finances and finally do production evaluation and close .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , starting off with the last one , don't have it here , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use kinetic battery , we want to use simple chip , because we're not gonna need shuffle , we're gonna need scroll , we're choosing latex case in fruity colours that's curved and we're using push buttons with supplement of an on-screen menu .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it sounded like we had set like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's do the look and feel design presentation first .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you wanna start ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "made three different prototypes and we'll start with this one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have our colours not are not fixed , but this is the general shape .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's you hold it either like this in your left hand or you switch it over and it's easily adaptable to either hand .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can push the buttons with your thumb like mobile phone , or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand , or even there's whole variety , you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have our up and down buttons , which are also gonna be our channel selectors , and we have our little menu button here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you push if you're just pushing these normally , they're the menu buttons , if the volume buttons rather .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you press select once , they become channel changing buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we press select three times , the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your t_v_ channel choices shows up , and you have your five presets down here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if people wanna grab hold of that , see how it feels in your hand .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's our number one prototype .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you wanna present the potato , or shall present the martian ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like little lightning in it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what we call that one the rhombus , the rhombus .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the little lightning bolt in it , very cute .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as power button ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's the rhombus , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this one is known as the potato , it's how can present it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's an ergonomic shape , so it fits in your hand nicely .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's designed to be used either in your left hand or in your hand .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've gone here just for four buttons on this one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the red ones are for changing channels , channel up and channel down and that's moves between your favourite channels that you've selected .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu and when you're working in the on-screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button to select and that's it , that's the potato .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on , off ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would be one of your channels , so like channel zero would be to switch the machine off , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we turn it off .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not really , it would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your t_v_ off .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you pressed and held it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that that'd be one way of doing it , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you like held it down , that would be on off .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that'd work , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on off , that's possibility , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then finally we have the martian or the pear , either way .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's bit different , just little bit more of creative feel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have the on off toggle stem on the top .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have the five preset seeds .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then you have on the sides to make it little bit more three-dimensional , you have your channel changing , volume changing buttons and your menu button here in the middle .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , that's for your consideration as , plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we figured it could stand up like this on your table , if you wanted it to , if made the bot the bottom flat .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what's the yellow one in the middle , forgot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the menu select button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that one's my favourite .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's our three prototypes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in terms of making decisions , what we'd need to do is first of all decide on form which of the three different shapes we want , then decide what button layout we want , how many buttons , and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wanna put any text on the device , like label on the buttons or put brand name or logo on it or whatever .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we were thinking that normally we'd go for fruity colours , but we're also thinking that your middle aged man , for an example customer , might not want fruity coloured remote , so we'd have one version that's bit toned down , with less contrasts on it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "something still little bright to make it hard to lose , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would , but we don't want it to look like kids' toy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now that was one thing that we brought up over email .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you picked up your email , but the feature that we considered for it not getting lost .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "were we were talking about that little bit when we got that email and we think that each of these are so distinctive , that it it's not just like another piece of technology around your house .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if it's like under covers or like in couch you still can't see it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's really would it be very difficult to just have an external device that like , you tape to your t_v_ that when you press it you ha little light beep goes off ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you think that would be conceptually possible ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it would be difficult technologically , because if your remote's lost it's probably under the settee and in that case you can't send an infrared sing signal to it to find it , so it's i'm not quite how it would work and then wonder if it's more just gimmick then anything else .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's true , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ho how many times do you really , lose your remote control and would device like that actually help you to find it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make noise , but it would take lot more development than we have this afternoon .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's fair evaluation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause , the designs are very bright , so you're , they're gonna stick out , but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so do people have preference as far as feel and functionality ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "feel like this is simil or it's what already exists so if we're trying to think of something like new and fun , even though this is like what you're init i'm initially drawn to , just 'cause it's like comfortable and like not different .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like this one , like why , it just it's like small but still like cute looking , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but also like the side buttons on that one , like that's neat .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but how much any of this has to do with the fashionable , looking thing that we also need to focus on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "could we have like an extra button on the top for on off ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so then we wouldn't have to have like dual function ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's good , that's good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's possible , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "here , stick it on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "put an extra the button on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "why don't we do product evaluation using your criteria , if you've developed some ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do we like we're supposed to have one that we do it for .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that was little vague on what exactly i'm supposed to do , but let me have to like write something on the whiteboard , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you need this or just write on the white board ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , actually don't have like powerpointy thing , 'cause it would be redundant .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's like joystick thing , kinda push it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "little smaller than that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , kinda like it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's hard to miss .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it makes look more fruity as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it does , it's like there it could have stem like that , 'cause do like the stem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's like deformed foot , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it almost helps you ge keep grip too , 'cause it goes in between fingers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like this one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that where people are leaning then , the potato ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "variety of colours are .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like the idea of the that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down , that one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm leaning towards the potato .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "am worried about like using menu .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in that like withing menus there are submenus , and so how do you get back to the main menu ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that on the ipod , you just every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again and it brings you back one level .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that has menu button separate from select button , whereas if this one's both the menu and the select button ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is , it's the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for list of choices .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you find the choice that you want and you press the button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "could these be used for going to submenus or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so they're used for going into and out of your submenus , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it can be one of those , if you press down and hold for two seconds , then it brings you back one level .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as long as we have that in mind as we're designing it still , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so which one are we roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our necessities , the yellowy one is that , can change it after we go through each different one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are we leaning towards the potato ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what we need to do is some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what we wanna do is that we each need to separately rank each of the following things and then i'll tabulate an average just to make that it does meet that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we'll just go through them one at time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true , or false , if the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we can do this one first .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "first we wanna it meets the fancy look and feel objective .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so like in my opinion the for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so i'm gonna say it's like three .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's just my opinion .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what does each of you , give it number , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "t's it's unique enough that i'd give it one or two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "will give it one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if it's creative .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if fancy is the word would use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if any of them are fancy in i'd say two , because unique .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and two , awesome .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll go for two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "alright , and same scale for functionality , is it functional ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's extremely functional , i'm gonna give it one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's functional , it's also pretty basic , so i'll give it two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it'll get everything done , it might be little confusing at first , if that's gonna be later one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's some other ones , will address that , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then i'm gonna give it two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we wanna know next if it's technologically innovative .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "did you give functional ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "she said it was one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is it technologically innovative ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not really , not so much , 'cause we don't have the screen , we don't have fancy chip .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "other than what it looks like , if it's really kinetic battery is big one , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the kinetic battery .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in the battery , that's it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how many people would notice that , though ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it but we t's there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but they'll notice it after like year , they'll be like , have never changed the battery .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if it's made of like latex , that whole idea , that's pretty .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll give it three .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just the material .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause it we could've picked lot of features that would've made it really alright .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would say that it's , like fancy versus creative it's different .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but does that equal innovative ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll give it three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'd say it's technologically it's not unique , it's just it is just pushbuttons , so i'd give it four .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'m gonna go with the four as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "really like that kinetic battery though .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "next , is it easy to use ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just so , easy to learn will be separate , so don't overlap them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's really easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll give it two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll give it one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "pretty hard to mess up .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll say one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let's say two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we next wanna see if it has spongy quality and if it's made of latex or rubber it's spongy all the way .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "give it one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wonder if it bounces when you drop it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that you couldn't it'd be harder to break , harder to lose .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause there would be less impact , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "iain , what do you give it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'd give it one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "alright and the next is , does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is it gonna be yellow ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it might be , 'cause that's our corporate colour , isn't it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", corporate colour , we didn't keep that in we would make it little less little more confusing , but if we had all the buttons in black , and design in and the outside in yellow , that'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours , one more conservative one , one that's more fruity .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we might wanna keep it yellow .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if you had like silvery white .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and can we have like an r_r_ inscribed on the bottom ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we had yellow .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "alright , so it it's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fruity , so fruity .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it was inspired by the potato , so it's pretty fruity .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's mangoey too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "mango that that's much more trendy than potato one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "mangoey is better , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm giving it one the mango put me over .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what are what's everyone's numbers ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright , and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "remember earlier we discussed that people don't use lot of buttons , that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we really took that into account lot , so i'm gonna give it one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "did you say one , rose ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "also we talked earlier about r_s_i_ and wanting to prevent any like carpal tunnely thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do we think that the latex grip appropriately takes that into account ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll give it two , 'cause almost feel like no matter what you do , something is gonna happen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's gonna be hard .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing , but like how it fits in the hand though so i'd go with two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "worth the risk , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll say two as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because older people that aren't used to like texting with the thumb might find it bit at first , but the menu system and the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be bit confusing , but if it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you'll have it afterwards .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll say two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "alright , awesome .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the ease of learning it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "know you were saying that you're little bit nervous about that , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it reminds me of the ipod .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "got mine , still haven't read the instruction book and i'm doing , so and i'm not good at learning technology .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so i'll give it two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so i'd give it two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it it's probably little harder then most remotes to learn , because you have to you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are and that could take bit of learning at first , but once you've , once you'd learned how to use it , it is lot easier .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i'd give it four .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'd give it four too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's pretty high learning curve , it'll be easy once you've done it , but we can say we addressed it with colour , but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright , also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we're not addressing that , so in terms of not losing it , do you think that on scale of one to seven , how easy or hard is it to lose ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm gonna give it four , 'cause that you can still if it's in between somewhere where you can't see it , you're not gonna find it , but anywhere else it's gonna stand out .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'd say i'd give it three , it depends on how tidy you are normally .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'd give it four .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll give it five 'cause it would be easy to lose something like that , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "alright , we also said simplicity , how does it address just being simple ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "simple to use or simple in design ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "overall , 'cause we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion , so those are the next two things we're gonna look at .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "separate from fancy , like that thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it like wants to be simple but it's not like simple , so i'm gonna give it two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm give it three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll give it two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "alright , and fashionable ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's hot , it's mango , come on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'd give it one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how fashionable can you make remote ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's bringing technology and fashion together real really .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't t's quite as fashionable as my robot remote or alien or whatever he was .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do like the little martian one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the toggle on off switch , it's really appealing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and does it meet our like demographic need for international appeal , that whole thing ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just that it would se serve our audience .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't see why not .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as long if we offer in at least three different colour arrangements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'll give it two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll say two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "alright , did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we didn't talk about ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we didn't address the fact that it does need to have corporate logo , so let's make we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an r_r_ on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "shall we all of them should have an r_r_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "all of them should have r_r_ , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so we're gonna do that , so it will address it , fine .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now we're gonna look at finances .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have an excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost , so let me exit out of this first .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let me one more space .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "gonna zoom in real quick .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're using kinetic battery , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're using kinetic , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we're having one per one , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "simple , simple rather .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it is pretty curvy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's very curvy , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "never did get picture of those so don't really know .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "our case material supplements , we just skipped by them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't we need plastic , and provided , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , we the plastic is the plastic for the inside is assumed .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the supplement is , it was rubber rather than latex .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it was rubber and special colour , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do we have more than one special colour ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're using we're gonna need at least two special colours .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what the se the basic colour is though .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "special colours , isn't it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "per , but we know that we're having at least three colours , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so let's say three .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are we talking about on each colour combination or are we , we'll like we'll have yellow and black .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that two special colours ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or is white and black , then two more or .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that thi that would be under yours .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's three , three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we'll just say three .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the r_r_ will be in colour as , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "interface , we're doing push buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and how many buttons do we have ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have six .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we've got five .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "six , with the power .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we'll do we wa are the buttons in special colour , special didn't get information on , does it but if we're making multiple varieties of this is where i'm getting confused .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "buttons , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the case material will just have one colour , but then the buttons will be in special colours ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're saying per unit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "per unit , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so each unit will only have one colour on their but the case is could have up to thr the buttons could ea could be up to three colours , 'cause that how it's designed there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright , and each button , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like it like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so special form ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they're all just push button , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , they're fine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "material , we want them rubber as probably , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do have to do it per button , do ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , don't .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they're if they're all gonna be rubber then it that's what it matters .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause it wouldn't make sense otherwise ,

everything .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now have all about circuits and chips and transponders and wrote it all down , because it would be relevant , like all the different parts of the inside of

multifunction remote control ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then it didn't have like any table , like awesome , i'm glad they asked that question and didn't report the result .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's really interesting though .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it was little tricky having to hand around this thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we had lot of the otherwise the technology

don't see how we could have very at least for me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if i'd gotten pictures of the different parts of the case , the different looks of the case , would have probably drawn them up , but , we could've put our brainstorming up there rather than just talking about it , but with only four people it doesn't really make sense .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause we weren't like voting on anything and usually , like whiteboards are good , like crossing out ideas , or like if we had like brainstorming period .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we were good orally .",

necessary to have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and these might've made us more willing to like take notes than to like write up them here , 'cause we all needed them separately , on the whiteboards in this room .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because we're all gonna be working in different places .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we if we were all gonna stay in here all the time , then having the notes up on the whiteboard would've been alright , but everyone needs their own , like specific notes , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now when you were creating your prototypes here , did you work together or did you like do separate projects ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we worked together , but we were making like we made different shapes and then discussed how the buttons might work , and how we could like improve on the design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it was bit of both really , we just started out by each taking colour of clay and just fooling around with it and came up with that rhombus shape and he came up with the potatoey , mangoey shape , and then just went from there really .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it was fun .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so done with the management , felt managed .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we did first of all giving our meetings the time , and second we actually we did good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's kinda fun .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and happens sometimes is that you tend to have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that happened to me all the time though .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but here we got clear and decisive points at the end of the meetings , so that we knew where to go on from there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting we didn't really have enough information to make firm decisions ,

"B"}, {"text": "this is what we'll do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "found that we did we could have used another five or ten minutes sometimes in the meetings .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for some of the meetings , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "especially last time , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the last time we had lot of information , but at the same time not quite enough , what , like we couldn't answer every single question .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and felt the first two meetings , that was coming in with no information , and not made me really like , throwing together powerpoint out of no information and then last time it was like the opposite .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "had so much information and so much to talk about .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it was interesting what came out like later , like as was doing the when was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me , that more points came out from your presentation even .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm little am little disappointed that we didn't do something for losing the remote , because that was big point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that was something like in order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and things like .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the problem was , even when we just were creating from the excel file , there wasn't like option to select to somehow have it included , so there was no we could be like , it has it included .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there was no way for us to have written down that it was really there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "considered the re .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we were just getting overenthusiastic with the task .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "t's interesting that they , .",

to discuss that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "know that like people have like things they can put on their keys that you press it and it'll beep , but i'm that would require some technology that what it is , but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things so you won't lose them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we were talking about it and like in my household at least , there's only about two places that the remote is ever 'cause there's only one t_v_ and there's only like three chairs .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's like saying you're never gonna lose your keys , and always do , anyway .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you'll lose in your pocket , like you just will forget that or you like put it down somewhere that like made sense and then not remember , there's always ways to lose things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it , it depends on how organised you are personally , but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or like what the
