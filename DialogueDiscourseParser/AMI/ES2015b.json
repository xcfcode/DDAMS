[{"edus": [{"text": "am starting now ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and hope you had productive last thirty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , i'll be taking minutes on this one , and being hooked up to the powerpoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for myself , because it'll be more about , what you are bringing to the meeting today .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is poppy's presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , so , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , take it away poppy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do need to plugged in .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's , it's plugged in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , no problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "will take this time just to apologise .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "only , received my emails later on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause was too busy carried away doing my own thing , which is not very good part of team-working thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but there we go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm it's fine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so was looking at how we're going to go about the working design , and what we actually need to do , and what the remote control needs to do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it needs to allow person to have portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they don't need to actually manually touch the television set .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , it gives them much more flexibility , and allows them to be where they want to be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "from , on functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one is the visibility in the dark , which was genevieve's idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we need to think about how we could bring this in technically .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we could use illuminated buttons , which we are all familiar with when we're using mobile phone , or something fam familiar .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "automatically , lights up at first touch .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or we could use fluorescent materials which would just take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "also we could use an alarm .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if we lost the remote control , perhaps there could be button on the television set itself , which you could press , and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "behind cushion or somewhere .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that would work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "go back there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "another thing we missed out on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "from previous researches i've carried out on other projects , we've learnt about smart materials where specific alloys of metals have shape memory .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so they can be heated and cooled , and they change the shape of the metal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , everything would spring apart .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , all the individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and that would be very important for products now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "especially 'cause there's much responsibility for all the companies who are coming up with like new designs .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", one question .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this , self-destructible metal , it allows for recycling materials ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they would , you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that's the part that would allow all the other parts to be separated at the end .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the user would return the product to the company , 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components , and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are gonna wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "something like the case , if it's scratched , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would we be the company that would break down these , or metals ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or would we contribute to another group ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you could we could probably empl employ , side company to do that for us .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for certain percentage at least .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not every , not hundred percent of everything we produce , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this sounds like really idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one thing we have to consider is our one hundred percent turnover goal that we have for our financial sector .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company , 'cause it sounds very labour-intensive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you would have to hire number of people , and it might be more expensive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the fact of the shape-memory alloys is that they , they don't need to be manually de deconstructed .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like , you don't have to individually unscrew all the screws .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because of this , their properties are smart material .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "all you need is just the heat , so they self-destruct themselves .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so suppose it does need like high contact , high quality machinery , and very specific machinery , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we'll still have to investigate the financial implications .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like the environmental approach .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also there is components .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this'll be how it will actually work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but haven't put this plan together yet .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm , could you those were .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "should go back .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this would actually show the circuit diagram .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "although haven't come up with the final circuit yet .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so put all those components in .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so those are what , we'll construct the remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "those are all the alright .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it just shows what energy source .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it could be battery , like rechargeable probably .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "an' , how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , now is it eight again to escape ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , the next presenter will be tara .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there you go tara .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can you see ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you it , function eight ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the one at the top .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm the user interface designer .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in this case it's the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "by taking inspiration from other similar designs , we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there're two functional design options .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and single function remote control , used specifically for the television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm , what was that last one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "multifunctional and ch , see .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "single function just for the television itself .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that single function remote control would be preferable , because it's easier to use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it'd be more compatible with range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and less functions would have to be included .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it would be cheaper to make .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with wider range of devices .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "does anyone have any questions ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so as far as we know , single function television remote control is us usable internationally ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's just that , when we're creating it , we're , we have to make it compatible with different brands of devices .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent , other entertainment devices .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "d_v_d_s and v_c_r_ ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "does everyone agree with this ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be better way to go ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was just wondering about the , what genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that would probably , ll what you said before about it being more profitable simplistic design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "suppose having that would complicate it lot more .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and limit the design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you think ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "agree with the single design thing for now , because we're trying to do so much , that if we're trying to make unique , user-friendly , dadada , and it's also multi also multifunctional , we're gonna go over budget for one thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make more original design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we'll have more money to go into the design side of it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "alright , are you ready for your presentation genevieve ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "except you're not hooked up to the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm not hooked up , but other than that , completely ready .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "lost my microphone .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no problem , we can i'm , what was that last thing that you just said ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and i'll give you little briefing on what that means exactly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you all remember from the email we got before our very first kick-off meeting , with the coffee machine ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what i'll be talking about now is the equivalent for remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what needs and desires are to be fulfilled .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i've done some marketing research , lot of interviews with remote control users , and some internet research .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and i'll show you my findings .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and firstly wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we believe in providing international market with fashionable products .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "hence our motto , we put the fashion in electronics .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that should be our priority here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not just in electronic fashion .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that it's something that fits in the household .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media , who's famous , what t_v_ shows are being watched , to influence our remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the findings .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which is , quite significant number .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the other twenty five percent didn't specify if they love them or found them , neutral .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "eighty percent of users would spend more money when remote control would look fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm , that eighty percent of users would spend more money when remote control would look fancy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you mean that they would spend more money on fancy-looking remote control ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they're willing , they're willing to spend money on remote control with personality .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as opposed to your basic , oval black , all same size button remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it is something that people care about .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's not , it's not ignored in the household .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap lot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "zapping meaning they go through channels lot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that very small amount .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "thought that was interesting .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright , so it might be very appealing if , we have very concise buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the single function .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and another thing with lots of surfing , we'd probably have to work on something that could be lot more durable , because find with channel-changers that , lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they're printed on the button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's good point .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and actually to go with that , i'm gonna give you some statistics on the relevancy of the buttons , how much they're used .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and how important the users find them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the power button , in an hour is only used once .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "hopefully the person's not turning on and off the t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so people wanna be able to turn on the t_v_ with the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "channel selection is used hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's huge amount .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is the most important button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so when commercials come on they're changing it , so as you said we want durable button that's not gonna run down .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "relevance of that button , our users found was ten , ten out of ten .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ditto for volume selection , so ten out of ten .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it's used on average four times an hour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not as much as channel selection , but still significant .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "relevance is two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "screen settings , which means brightness , colour etcetera , zero point five times an hour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and relevance of one point five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're getting to specific statistics here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "teletext , now i'm not too clear on what that is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you can help me .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is that so like running banner , underneath .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's it has t_v_ has like information , it has information on holidays , the news , entertainment .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's like the news .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or like information .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the and what's on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's no it's button that you press , and then you , like menu pops up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , li .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "haven't used it before but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's like very basic internet .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you have page numbers like for the menu , and you press the page numbers with your remote , and it , it'll come up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "very basic internet , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", it's just information that , like television timetables , what's on , what's on now , what's on next , on every channel , and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you have .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like tells you the weather , and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you have no interaction back with it , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like the internet you can send emails and you've no interaction .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm not with it , because wasn't but it's , it's being used fourteen times an hour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and has high relevance of six point five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "zero point zero one times an hour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "relevance of three .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "probably just tuning in the channels , would it be ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "changing the channels ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "tuning them in at the very start .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you get new t_v_ set , you tune in all the channels , do you think ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to get the reception and picture , suppose .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's not used very often , but people still find it relevant .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "biggest frustrations of the people that we interviewed .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "remote controls are often lost somewhere .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that was already discussed by poppy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how we could have , an alarm system so that people can find it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "takes too much time to learn how to use new remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it should be very user-friendly , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "people to do very quickly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "remote controls are bad for r_s_i_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "repetitive strain injury .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that what it is ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "people with arthritis and such ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's rather sad .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our designers can look into that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm guessing that's what it is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "buttons that don't require , very firm pushing , if they respond .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we'll have to also avoid , buttons responding to the slightest touch as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "did you get that one down ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "here's some ideas for you .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so i'll show you some numbers here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the youngest age group , fifteen to twenty five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and you can see that number decreases bit with ol interestingly enough , twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that would , are willing to pay extra .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're , we're targeting , and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if we have the budget for it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we are targeting young adults , it looks like something that would pay off .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "seeing as ninety percent , over ninety percent would pay for it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "agree with if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "financially and functionally .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and especially if we are trying to be trendy , go with fashions , things like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably won't be as concerned .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that , that's whole other field of research .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it'd be , if we'd still have remote , or if you're talking to your television and saying change channel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and depending on how many members you have in households .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it may be too complicated for us , but it's something to keep in mind anyway .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and something that might further complicate it is that the t_v_ makes noise itself .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wonder if it would have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if there was conversation in the room at the same time , although in theory it doesn't tend to be when you're watching television , but could be very difficult to get the specific design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we're looking for simplistic design , if we need to decide if that is our intention is , is simplistic design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because if , if it is then voice , voice-activated , and that would negate the whole remote control thing , because if people can activate the television with their voice then they won't be using , they won't be talking into remote , i'm .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it looks like .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it'd be like the ultimate remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the last thing here was , an screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , voice recognition might be little too extreme for us .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "an screen though might be something that , you can shift through pages li the way this powerpoint is working .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that you don't have so many buttons to deal with .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what an screen is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just , just screen , like computer screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or like an alarm clock .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you'd have an versus just , normal clock .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what , what would appear on the screen ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have no idea still .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just like an electronic screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as opposed to just buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there would be like little , like on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "on the remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like on the top of cellphone , the little screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now that's , exactly what exactly we'd put on there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the channel that you're on , the volume setting .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "could it would be good if it had the actual programme that was on , and what was next .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that would probably be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like linked in with the teletext , or like an teletext at your fingers , without having to access that through the television .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would be good , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "might be quite expensive to do that though .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's something we can all take back to our respective research .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and finally , whoops , my personal preferences and thoughts .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "our priority really should be unique design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we want something that people want in their home .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "every remote control looks the same , so in my opinion it should be , user-friendly and unique .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the other might be little too , little too gadgety for some people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "myself , voice recognition scares me off .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if we're , if we're aiming to make this an international university , universally accepted product , and for all , the other thing is like age market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but if we wanna make fifty million , and have everyone want this remote control , we should stick to the basics .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five euros to spend on remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like their priorities might not be fancy remote control , when they're just starting out and , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we have to keep in mind the , the reliability of our research .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", sixteen year old boy would say , i'd pay extra for voice recognition , until they realise that's three months allowance .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , the older generations we should be catering to bit more .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "early twenties , that's the age group .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if one of the largest , or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use remote control , i'm that something like an screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "complicated jus complicating things even fo .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's it for the market research .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "before we go into more discussion on we want this design to look like , i've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for one thing , because having controls with d_v_d_ , v_c_r_ , that thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've decided not to include them and make it specific , just specific television function .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which is good as , as we've decided that we would like to go with that anyway .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for many reasons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we have that decision made for us .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "another thing that might affect other decisions is that the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so we won't concern ourselves with navigating the teletext option .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would you like to plug in your have you got powerpoint or not ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can do the there you go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm looking at it now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "come back screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "were they , was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext , or just avoiding both altogether ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", we don't have the resources or possibility of using the internet with the remote control , but they were just saying that the teletext would not be used .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright , and another thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is for the design , the design of the product is that we wanna create , more of sense that people know that this is from our company .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , all the remote controls must have our we'll incorporate our logo and colour in some way .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , perhaps our logo on the bottom , or wherever you feel like it would look good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it doesn't have to be the colour of our company but , another thing is that , we need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm assuming that we already have one , but for the purposes of this meeting , wasn't offered , like type of logo or colour , so if that could be somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "work on that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's probably r_r_ in yellow .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the little yellow thing ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , those are the changes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , now we need to discuss , and come to decision on our remote control functions , of how this is going to be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm just going to look at my notes for second .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to decide on target group and the functions of the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , we already know that it'll just be for the television .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it'll it won't have teletext .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , we could discuss those other options that you brought up , genevieve .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so are we going to write off the option ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is that how most people feel about that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so no , no teletext , and no voice recognition .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it would be annoying though if don't use teletext that much , but if it was on your t_v_ , you'd want to be able to use it , if you'd .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but another thing is that if we're reaching an international crowd , know for one that in north america there is no such thing as teletext , so it'd be really superfluous .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so is it just .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "never heard of it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "about other countries besides the u_k_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do if anywhere else has it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "more research required , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if was it management decision that we're having .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it was management decision , so it's , it's out of our hands at this point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , we're looking at something rather simple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the what was the word they used ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "findability is important .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause i'm that could be inex inexpensive because we could use the same infrared the same signal through that and it could just like make little beeping noise .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the same signalling .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or vibrate just the same as mobile phone .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's not that expensive to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like you just , buzz .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like that idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would you be able to , put the little device anywhere ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause isn't our remote control for all t_v_s , so you'd ha , with the button that you pressed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if do you mean the link between the , if the button was actually on , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause then it would only be applicable to one t_v_ set , so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "minor detail there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be not very obtrusive .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it would have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "something small that's , that's good point .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then it wouldn't , it probably wouldn't be able to use it would be able to use the same reception on the remote control , but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would it need battery then ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "unless it could be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's your department you'll have to sort that out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "unless some way , it could have some universal connection to like the socket , the same socket that the t_v_'s supplied from .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the power for the t_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , more research into that one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you'll have to , you'll have to investi do some research on that , alright ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright , and i'm that , the glow-in-the-dark , fluorescent , whatever , system , is go ahead .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is everyone interested in that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "on the buttons ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like the light up suggestion .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that would be better .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time , so would go for just the numbers could be embossed , couldn't it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it doesn't it could be tactile thing as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we're minimising buttons , we might be able to make them actually larger .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and there's something on it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like up arrow down arrow for , for volume .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like raised that's true .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and what we could do for , for channels .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the numbers themselves .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but then the like up button and down button for the channel , channel changing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "could be raised .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just little arrows , that you could feel , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "thought that it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is light up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and also , heather you mentioned before , like how it should be accessible to everybody .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so like big buttons , for people you are visually impaired .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the glow-in-the-dark or light up won't make any difference anyway .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so like you say tactile might be better , because it'd be more available to everybody .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that , that's good , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "could we somehow we could , may , possibly , incorporate them both so that the buttons could be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause don't think that glow-in-the-dark material , like the actual soft plastic , costs that much more than other colours .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , wouldn't say so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , it's not these days .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's quite easily accessible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the other option , referring to the battery thing is , how cellphones will light up for fifteen seconds , when you're and then it goes , so if , if you're like changing the volume during movie .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's good that good idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "know , i'm thinking of mostly when you're watching movie you turn all the lights off .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and you don't want to turn on the lights , to turn it down , because there's suddenly an explosion , and it's gonna wake up the baby .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if you touch the button , it reactivates it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it lights up for on self timer .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that , that's good idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so self-timed lighting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "alright we have five minutes left , for the meeting , but we should discuss this light subject little bit more before we close .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what was missed the last moment , reading that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what were you talking about with the lighting up buttons ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just if it was kinda the same way that cell how cellphone will light up for about ten , fifteen seconds when you touch button , after having not touched it for while .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if instead of constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it could be any button that would be pressed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you , you touch it and it just lights up bit , and it gives faint glow .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , self-timed .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if you have all the lights off in your living room , you'll temporarily see it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because usually you're not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's probably feasible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , do you think that we should do the lighting up thing , and the glow-in-the-dark thing , and the shape of the numbers ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do we have to decide what we're gonna do with this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the shape of the numbers is really good idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that's un unique as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for visually impaired , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "haven't seen that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and as you're saying like numbers can wear off if they're just like painted on , printed .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it could , if it's that softer rubber material it'll be , better for people with els no what's it called , r_s_i_ , what was it that we were talking about ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "repetitive strain injury .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "instead of like hard buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if was thinking though , if it was glow-in-the-dark , you could put the real reaction symbol as glow-in-the-dark , and then it would be constantly advertised .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like should we do both ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or we can have one or the other ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because it might , for our design purposes , the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has funny kinda colour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was gonna say , exactly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it the it might be perceived as tacky , glow-in-the-dark .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's like eighties neon-style .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we could there are now like loads , or huge range of different colours that it could light up in as , which could like link in with the company colours .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "whereas we're trying to be trendy and fashionable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like it could be blue or green or yellow , or like we've just limited with the , just ordinary phosphorescent so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we've decided on lighting up things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "every time the , that it lit up , you that could light up as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or , or the , whate .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but with the same thing , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you touch the button and then it could be , it could be lit up as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is are you with that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that completes most of our more practical decisions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and now it's up to designing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and making that this can be feasible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and do you have anything do you have anything to say ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was just gonna throw out there the thought about personalising the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it , you , 'cause you mentioned face plates .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if there's something that diff , like five different face plates .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if this will start making it more complicated , but it could increase the popularity of the , of the remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like you can have changeable mobile covers .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "exactly , like an ipod .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like an ipod ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would be good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or , or like mobile ph .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if we'd want to go with like t_v_ show themes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like bart simpson faceplate .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then that would be more profitable like as sideline to the remote as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "could buy extra .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's good idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that we should incorporate that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause that wouldn't be very expensive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you'd just get one mould , throw some plastic in it , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "interchan and also possible , we could gain out of that by advertising certain t_v_ shows , or .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that might be com problematic with copyright issues .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , if it takes off then we'll , we'll try that out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if we , there is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could , the environmental factor , we didn't bring that up again .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we'll have to do more research .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like as of yet , that has nothing to do with , the way it'll look .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does it need to be reached de do we need to reach decision on that now ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because we need to investigate the financial implications .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's we could probably leave that 'til later on , then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it does it need to be decided on now ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or should we .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "anyone else have anything more to say before we close ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's have lunch and we'll discuss this later .", "speaker": "A"}],
