this ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "alright , it is powerpoint time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i've done more powerpoints in this particular experiment than i've ever done in my life before this experiment which is fun .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so here we have our detailed design meeting where we will look at the prototype and so , finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it means i'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "otherwise it's just saying i'm the secretary and i'm therefore i'm taking the minutes , so just to go just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , will open them slowly , no ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for it , for it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's not you .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's how the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is , this is very high-powered here , double-clicking , there we go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the moral of the story from our last minute last meeting was that we had meetings from we had presentations done by the industrial designer , or from nathan , and ron and from sarah about what we can do here and what limitations we're operating with excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop remote with voice recognition , i_e_ that had vaguely non-remote like shape because you didn't really need to use it as remote since you could just use your voice .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would include some mostly just the simple design features for television operation but with slide or fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the u_i_d_ and the i_d_ were asked to go ahead and start developing prototype for us to look at .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's sorted , back to the main meet here , go ahead and take it away .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have assembled our prototype , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what's to be said about it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we took into account lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is going to be the on off button and we have these buttons to go through the channels and then two volume buttons down here , we decided those were the most important buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then , for the more advanced functions there is slide out panel here and you can see that there are lots of other things going on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but this actually can slide back in and provides very aesthetic when it's all put away , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as far as the whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out , why not ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no it's important to we talked quite bit about the interchangeable faces and what we've done here is come up with bit of natural look here we call it fruity if you will .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", that's interchangeable and it would be desirable for the regular product in the first packaging to be something little bit more subdued but this is something that can be done and as you can see on the television there we have the voice detector device on the top there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it is an option .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's this here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that will work quite with regard to finding this contraption .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what other things do we see here , if you give it touch it does have actually bit of spongy feel , so that will work with regards to our market .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and let's see , clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you have anything else to add to that ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "worried about the materials , it is the entire thing is covered in rubber coating so it's very durable , it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and as you can see and if you touch it does have that squishy feel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's actually important to note that the television , if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that it actually is edible inside .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "fact , if you noticed , but wrote the company's name on the telephone screen , that was kinda .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "done , edible televisions , it's wave of the future .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this was actually an apple on the inside .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do we need to worry about rot factors ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's encased in new type of polymer .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's preservatives involved , we don't need to worry , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we got bit ahead of ourselves , know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no but it's couple years off at least .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's pos possible new product .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that's that sums up the main features of our of the remote , if you have any questions or whether that whether we need to worry about any other marketing areas or anything of that nature .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "did we come in under budget ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we did , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this cost to put this into production , we're looking at about what was our goal ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it was twelve fifty euro and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so was quite pleased with that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one thing that we didn't do we had choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for classic rubber button and since we did that we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite and that's what helped keep the cost down .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so even though it has lot of modern technology , the voice recognition , in lot of ways it's just simple remote and if we shopped around for other manufacturers we might be able to get even cheaper .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "did we talk about the voice recognition option ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and no , we haven't talked about that yet have we ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition console and it's nicely designed into the overall look .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the voice recognition incorporates the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw come up with .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "quite similar to the coffee maker design that we were talking about earlier and , that has given proven ease of use and what not .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , that's very , very good work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do we have other , for lack of better word , skins ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have go or ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you wanna answer this one or do you want me to answer it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do we know where we stand on that yet ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "didn't quite have enough material .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wasn't expecting prototype didn't you had any in mind yet .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as you can see this is just most superficial layer and it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like it's not quite face plate , it's more like pseudo-face plate because it's simple enough that in the factory it could we could very easily put different one on it , it locks into place such that , it's pretty permanent but at the same time , if we wanna go the other way it's just matter of couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way if what .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just veneer really , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "actually this bottom red ring here just unclips and then you put new plate on top of that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the whole thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so there are we definitely priced out spongy even spongier non-natural look materials which worked out fine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we also continued on with the ideas that following apple's colour schemes with the light orange and the green .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's still an option if we need it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "very , job .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like it , brilliant .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , got me you've got you provided number that actually sounds quite .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the trouble is was just given this by finance .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's spreadsheet of the parts and i've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm just gonna clear this out real quickly , but it looks like so we'll just if we can just itemize what's in here , we've got this it's solar cell thing ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we didn't really touch on that but it it's in there , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "with back-up battery ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with the ba .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and clever , done .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the voice recognition area actually doubles as the solar cell area .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that would mean we've got bit of it's speaker and sensor at the same time isn't it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's just making use of the same space and the same materials , but , one big curve you could say .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the case , it's more of single-curved case , would be that be the general and we've got rubber skin material throughout .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "push button interface with this other drop-down so we've got two push button interfaces don't we ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and special it's we've got wood materi rubbery type material that throughout , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you have to mark special colour and special form as , don't you ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause it is very unconventional , like to think of it as unconventional .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's quite unique .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like it , it's so it looks like bit over budget , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "come in at sixteen ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "doesn't match up does it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what we could do perhaps , simple fix would to switch away from the solar cells or take out the back-up battery .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how do you feel about that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , although it does still have battery so i'm not that what the sell is on that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying look my remote isn't working what am gonna do ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "people'd be real upset .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in the long-run it's better to keep the battery , it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what's difficult , we have all these things integral to the design of it that we just can't back out of now , it would have to be seems like we'd have to go back to square one in way .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it , it's either or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental the solar cell is big piece of the way we're marketing this as like natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if i've done my math correctly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing that's what sets us apart ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which , it's that's what setting us into this young market , that's where we started from , so , and perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the reality is , for me from an ideological stand point , i'd like to stick with the solar cell , but have to throw myself in the business structure model here and that we need to come to compromise here and move ahead with the project , without the solar cell .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "unfortunately that's our best option .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we might have to do that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's the only way we're gonna get below our goal isn't it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "of twelve fifty .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're and we can't get rid of the removing the changing the case wouldn't be so much of , nor would changing the case materials .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that looks like to be the only thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that would be the it's major change but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "gotta do what you gotta do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "alright , so we're in agreement on that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "unfortunately we are .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , that was good compromise you brought forward sarah .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "moving along swiftly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so now we just go to the project evaluation which will allow sarah to take over .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would be me .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can you reach , that would be , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that'd be brilliant .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "didn't even do that one on purpose either , damn .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", was just evaluating from what we know of how our product's working now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do , these are the things that look like we feel they're important .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so was looking at basic design things , does it fulfil its functions as remote ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is the design what we wanted it to do ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "basic questions like , does it turn on ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "does it respond to voice recognition ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and overall , in general , it looks like it's coming up to par .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the only thing is with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting because it's new interface , that looked like it was coming up rough , but then , once you get used to it , it does make lot of sense .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so overall we're headed in the direction .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they like that spongy feel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it looks like it's going over , so we're good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the paging function works , that's good to hear , we worked hard on that one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's eventually if we do branch out with this product we do have higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and , but for now , what we've got is working in the range we need it for , so it's all good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel but it's .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's everything from me .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it is set-back , but , do you need the cord back ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we might have we might have lost that granola market again that we're that's true .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was just go on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they don't own tellys anyway do they ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , this one's bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "got this slide from the coach and i'm not what it's connected to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we are going to discuss our project process and that is gonna go into my report .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is the point where we go out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and how worked , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as in within the team or ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's just open mic thing or .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "hope i'm not screwing up an experiment .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it is now , you're in charge so there you go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but trust that she would jump in if was so fair enough .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so any thoughts ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are we considering these points here ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they're starting blocks .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what do you feel about the process ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in general , for day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive , considering the little amount of input we had going in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the technology has definitely been help , it's really been interesting to try out all this new .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we didn't use the whiteboard .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , no whiteboard .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , we didn't .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could now if that'd make up for it but really and feel like if you had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints , doesn't really matter .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , also had not been intrigued about the pen , don't woulda used it , didn't write barely anything .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was taking notes more often than usual just 'cause liked the pen , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was pretty tack though .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "am disappointed didn't get note back from my personal coach .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as you write your personal coach .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but didn't get response so we'll see .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what if you get response two or three months from now ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would be kinda creepy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that'd be weird .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "attempts to contact coach ineffective .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what coaching is that really ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what if really needed something .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so don't there was lot of room for creativity , we could do whatever what we wanted until the budget came down on us , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and even then we did get decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "with the natural look .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's very natural .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "very natural look .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "organic , really .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's the brilliance of they had peeler in here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and highly resourceful team mates might add which is always plus .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", re it was like really creative actually , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the teamwork was good as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste single bit of play-doh , we used every bit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "all four of those little containers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with , we only had four , wasn't enough .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "including the multi-coloured wave pattern .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "could have been amazing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what did you think about the roles ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they were good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's fun , it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the time and filled in the gaps enough .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "at the same time you had enough room to just make things up , which was fun .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do your own .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "though did feel like the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's just me but didn't actually get any information for the last presentation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's true , got this spreadsheet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "nothing , didn't even get an email , like that was it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , feel like that was slightly lacking but then , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that was an issue kept finding with regard to no but also when was reporting about what each of us was doing was often confused as to what you were doing and then also felt like lot of our discussion would centre around specifically what my task was because that was the interface portion which was what the whole project was about but and then in the end our jobs melded together little bit more , which was fine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "of what to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that wasn't very much .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "very much so .", "speaker": "D"},

get felt like got way too into it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's good thing though , give the rest of us some structure to work with so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "felt like slipped into it lot .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's kinda fun .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "an so is that the first time you've taken on that role ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the first time i've ever done anything like project management .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "usually organise crap , it's one thing to do , set up party with your friends , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you felt that you

out the window .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "be fun with legos too , like make remote control or spaceship , we used to have spaceship legos did you ever used to build spaceships with legos everybody
