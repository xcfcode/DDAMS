[{"edus": [{"text": "how do you wear this thing ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not too many cables and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so welcome everyone .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we are here for the kickoff meeting of the process of designing new remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so will first start with warm welcome opening , then we will see what will be our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we will discuss if we have few ideas and we will end by dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just one thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you said twenty-five minutes , but have something else to do , so gotta have another meeting soon , so you could hurry up bit it's true .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have another meeting so if you could .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have another meeting soon ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you have to be quick .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for the lawnmower project .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the goal is to have remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the design step will be divided in three main points .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first it will be the functional design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we will move to conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what user interf interface we want and what are the different trend in user interface and like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then the desired devi design will consist in specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've made in the second point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so will now ask you which is very important for the design of new remote control for to each of us to draw your favourite animal on the white board .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what an original idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no you should write the name .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you should if you want to react about this wonderful drawing i'll let you comment .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can give you the no ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but don't have to say anything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "when i'm drawing the orangutan .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's an abstract drawing of an orangutan .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's an abstract drawing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's and original .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't have red colour .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "usually orangutans have red hair so this is very important but don't have red pen , so yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you want to draw something christine ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have to imagine little bit .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "your animal is recorded so it's not lost .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is this it's pretty .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wha what is this strange beast ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it beautiful ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is it monster ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "these things did not exist .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes is it like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is it better ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "does have name ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's my cat .", "speaker": "D"},

draw ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "draw like very simplified cow .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if it looks like cow like what ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "he looks like bong .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it looks more like donkey would say .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we will be finished this is it for putting for logos , no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so hope that it helps you in the process of designing remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's is there matter for new remote control ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let's move on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so here the financial objective of our project .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that is to say to have production cost lower than twelve point five euros and have selling price of twice that price in order to target profe profit of fifty million euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if it's trendy , original fulfil the user needs .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it single device remote control or is it multi-device remote control ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have to discuss that point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is not defined ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "on you can suggest points like this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what so we have to decide if it can control one device or multiple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what's what are your ideas about that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have the your opinion from the marketing side ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do we sell other ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we bundle the remote control with something to sell then it could be single device , otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy remote control from us .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if it selled by its own it would rather be for multiple device .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you agree ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it should be for multiple devices .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and do you have any ideas of design ideas or any technical requirement we should fulfil ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we shouldn't have too many for my part .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , couldn not of any requirements now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we don't have so many buttons could be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and do you have it also to be lighted in order to be used in the dark ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "might be good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and do you have any idea of the trend in domain , what it shouldn't it should look like , or things like that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "something which is not squarey , not box .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "something like that , least fits in your hand .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the basic requirement .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "fit in your hand , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and also it have , it may be it may be important for the remote control to be to , to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we should have device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it is original because you can use it in your bath whereas the others can't .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "water-proof would be very original .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "havin having water-proof remote control so that the people can use it in their bath .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that could be but , it is still something you have to buy and that is not very , mayb but we can bulk it with already this plastic thing and the waterproof as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it seems so , but if you don't have an waterproof remote control it means you can just cover it with some plastic and you can and , and that's one of the that's one of the shock there are people that have remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's people they actually do it themselves .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it will look bulky in that case .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can sell all that together , so plastic protection and waterproof box as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that might be good track to follow .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like as an optional thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "optional or selled with it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we should have something , most of the time lose my remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should have special bu button on the t_v_ to make the remote control beeping .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can have but we don't design the t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can have something you whistle and the remote control beep .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can have whistle remote control ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "whistle tracking remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's good idea , that's very original and that's can improve .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's quite , but we you don't normally need any audio recording on your remote control ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's just going to add to the cost .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but still we have to we have to have an advantage over our competitors .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is good advantage .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like the idea , but i'm not about the what you , who is giving who's giving our budget .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have to ask .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to ask the quest of that's design to the industrial designer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which is you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so try to find that for next meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so next meeting is in thirty minutes or so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so will ask the industrial designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working function we have discussed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so then will ask the user interf interface designer to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons , the fact that is lighted or not , things like that , and what would be convenient for the user .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and also will ask the market expert to try to find out what are the absolute requirements , what is needed in remote control for the user .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then will just ask you to think about that and look at your mail because you will receive some good advice soon .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's all for this point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we come back in five minutes ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "half an hour .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "anyway you will receive some messages .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you eat it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does it move ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if it
