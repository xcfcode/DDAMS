meetings , and i'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll get the ones up for next time , they're not finished yet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and start if you want .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is there an order ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we haven't decided on an order .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , any order's fine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how do put this i'll just put the cable in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just you may need to but sometimes you have to do it it's like three set setting cycle , so press it couple times , hold down function and then press eight .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can you see ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what happens it doesn't work ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it sh it takes few seconds .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it in the thing ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you need to help me .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then press function .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "could you just plug it back into hers because she had .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's is that it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "here we are .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the cable might be little loose .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "here we are .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you got it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it on ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , hundred people were tested in usability laboratory through just their habits to know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the findings in some cases matched what we were talking about .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "custome customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's study of the buttons that they use most and we should design according to these buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "easy to lose , and r_s_i_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what r_s_i_ means .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the person that did the questionnaire did , don't have clue .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , have made list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they're used about hundred and sixty times per hour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so and people like to zap lot , so this is the order .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "channel selection , teletext , volume , and power .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the other ones are the settings , and they're used less than zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that we can we could have like button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if we look at the market , people from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , don't really know how to describe this , ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this product , while people that are above thirty five years ol years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five wouldn't actually pay for this thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't what the decision to be made is , but that the people that actually do buy remotes more are those like teenagers and young professionals and , most likely , but we should discuss this together .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that's all have to say about the matter , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "shall what do ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do give this to someone else ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just move on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so get this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so now need to press eight , what is it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's the little blue it's the one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "function , see it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "should be it should be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this my presentation about the technical functions design and just tried to focus on just what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so and like thought about it myself and looked on the internet .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so like it is really important that we get this done in user friendly and fashionable way .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so things like keeping buttons together that like close together that are used in the same way , or that making the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the leas to minimum , and also things like is it can you small enough large enough i'm not we would need to do some research about , would , about what size is appropriate and that thing , but we need to make that it turns on and off the t_v_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "does it have like capacity to change the channels ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "does it do or do we need to have like functions for cable or v_c_r_ ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then , is it findable , and how do we wanna do that ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , if this will work but and we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just like the one on the better , just because it does have fewer buttons , but we sh can think about things like colour and size , shapes , that thing , to best fit the user .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that concludes my presentation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you need the little thingy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's on view .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this is on the working design , which is the mechanical functions of the remote , and the method used was to look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input channel or volume setting and it will be output to the t_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and also we talked about location function where you could press button on the t_v_ and it would send signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , input which would probably be buttons , although we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , something to transmit it to the t_v_ , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly beep or vibration .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and also you need sender for location signal , which would probably be separate thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their t_v_ or stick it on their wall .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and this is just an overview of how the remote works .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the t_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then for the location function , you would have sender on the t_v_ which would output some signal , we could use i_r_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that signal would go to receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of buzzer or light lighting up .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , button pad for input , we can purchase pre-made chip which will handle all the processing , i_r_ transmitter to communicate to the t_v_ , that's just standard , so most t_v_s have an i_r_ receiver .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "probably radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and i'd probably say buzzer for the location function on the remote itself .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that concludes my presentation .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do about like , you seem like about .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was an engineer before came here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have we'll discuss that and then wanna mention some new project requirements that came in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "teletext is outdated , so due to internet popularity , so that's off the list .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also our remote should be used only for television , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let's be fashionable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we have something silver and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had like silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do let's we should make some brainstorming , see what we can wha what probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and the buttons and what it does and that thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like in terms of how it looks , or like what it does ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how it looks or the buzzer you mean , for , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so is our target group then people so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that seems to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's easy to implement .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range , what was it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "teenagers and young professionals .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's for speech recognition .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was thinking about that but speech recognition is really hard to programme , and also , if the t_v_ is on it's making sound and the people on the t_v_ are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the t_v_'s gonna switch itself to channel one , or it seems like silly , i'm not how you would implement it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's only for speech recognition and screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "put the values in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if you consider our budget , it probably if you consider our budget , to have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be little pricey .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the screen is the same as what , i'm happy with that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's idea but you would have to have button on t_v_ or on your wall or some place since the t_v_ already has power .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so are we gonna have just some like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the t_v_ itself .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you click the button , it's gonna send out signal , and was thinking , i_r_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the t_v_ it's not gonna work , so probably like radio signal like on cell phone .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "sends out signal and then the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you you'd need like separate base for that or like something you can .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so do you plug it in the t_ you plug it in t_v_ , this thing ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it'd probably just stick it on your t_v_ so if you need to find the remote , click the button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's now like two-part thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it would be two part package .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we get to design that too .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "make it fashionable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are we should that thing be on the thing to put the you talking about home for it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you still want to build little thing next to the telly or to hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we probably leave that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one takes care of the other , like if you can if you can call it then it's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then it can live anywhere .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for the so you have that button , that so there's is there light or shall we leave just have radio ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "on the t_v_ or on the phone ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "are we just having radio ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "on the phone .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it seemed like beep seemed the most reasonable to me , that's what the phone has , when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you don't need light .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and like if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can hear it's under the couch .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so need the other buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we have this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the two remotes that you had shown don't remember who showed them , you did , they're one looked like it was for v_c_r_ type thing , and the other looked like just television .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that was me .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they're both just like general remo they're both general remotes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have v_c_r_ capabilities .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does anyone v_c_r_s are the same across international ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they're not no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they're not , no .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you'd need like whole different set of buttons for everybody's v_c_r_s .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it not v_h_s_ here ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but d_v_d_ probably is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "other than that region and coding thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , it's gonna be d_v_d_ type , that's the technology these days .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's see if still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take like just reduce the number of buttons , like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with , or you can just scroll through the options that come up on the t_v_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for we need the we can just design the channels ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "power's just button , and it's not used that much , and it's usually that red and it's quite to keep it like red .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i've seen some remotes that where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it's different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you don't actually have separate power button , it's just but it might be confusing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it seems like that would be hard though .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like because unless .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just 'cause wouldn't would probably pick it up and just be like why is there no on button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "besides you like to be able to go power .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "never think to hold something down .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have the power .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we definitely want power button and numbers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "even ipod thing , like , if people like this but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have scrolling .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that like joystick flat touch thing , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because people li seem now the ipod's out people seem to like this thing that there's no know you don't have one two three four five , it's just and it's one thing which has everything .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's an interesting idea , 'cause it's , it's funny like you like don't have an ipod but like , like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day , and you just and it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily , like it's not that hard , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it is really but do you need screen then , do you have to have screen then ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can't it tell the like can't you if you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then it's like this like that , and then you do that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can have the number going around in the corner .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we have this like scrolling button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's gonna is that like on mouse pad where like .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's like it's just like the same technology as mouse pad .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've never used one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then you can have if you actually just want to zap , you can have like thing like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so like it's like little part of the circle that or it so it's just region of the circle that you can zap .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can , click actually click on to have .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could even have four buttons , like , if that's the if that's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so volume could be like the top it and the bottom so do you need to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "doesn't it rotate though , so it'll be moving around .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like , 'cause so , so when you scroll your thumb like around it , it'll like say you're go you're going clockwise .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what do you mean the function ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that means you're gonna go up the channels , and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then so if you wanna switch to the to do you have to switch to function where like so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like this is channel that way , that's that way and volume is up and down .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it knows for some reason .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it just kno the ipod knows .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the ipod knows .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it works on an ipod then it works .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't have one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then you do that it goes , but if you like that makes more sense 'cause there's already ones with up and down here , that i've seen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's like holding you can and you is there an extra actual button ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or are you actually you're just using the mouse to go up and down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what you for the ipod you press an if you're on the channel let's say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's like we can go on the fact that it does just work with the ipod .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if you wanna keep it with volume here and here , i'm pretty .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you're gonna this for channels , then wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like you could just have , like you could actually .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you could click and then have it up and down , but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the only thing is like , ipods are so expensive , like , it has to be is that part of , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is that what makes them expensi it's all of they have so much memory though , that's it's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't t's the wheel dealy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's the it's their capabili they it can hold what like five thousand songs .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm thinking we could if we're hav so ba but an ipod just has that circle thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they're re-programmable aren't they ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can put on your songs and then put on different set , that's probably why they're expensive , they're like little computers .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it qui shape , like it could be , because it could be circular , weird like that , just .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "could just be simple instead of being mass .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because , the other thing , didn't tell you all my presentation , is that people find it find that it's big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote and that's another thing they complained about .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what other buttons were there ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "volume we've ts just said that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is just for t_v_ , it's not for or it is does need to be compatible with .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "d_v_d_ is simple , you just have play , pause , eject , and menu .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "actually our new project requirements , i'm not if they meant onl use only for television as in not for d_v_d_ or just not internet type things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so how do you switch .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i'll check that and update you on the next but we'll hold off on that 'cause but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so like if we had that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but d_v_d_ players usually have their own remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's true , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , 'm not really clear on what , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it's to have it all on one , because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume , and then you wanna go to the menu , so you don't wanna switch .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you'd have to have like you would have to have like function switch button , somewhere so like you can you're either on t_v_ , you're on d_v_d_ or you're on v_c_r_ , or you're like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but d_v_d_ is only like four buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , but like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc , the touch pad .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it is only fun .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the circle only does channel isn't applicable to d_v_d_ really 'cause you don't wanna but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the t_v_ so you don't have to switch .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", let's think about it 'cause we need to wrap up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes we can try that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire , then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work , so think about the things we've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see you soon .", "speaker": "A"}], "id":
