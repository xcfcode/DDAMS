, .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it has to be twelve and half .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you're going to redesign something .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're at twenty five .", "speaker":

one to ninety one percent , sixty six to seventy six .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we haven't really integrated this the speech into the system , so we can might as drop that .", "speaker": "C"},

these two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you have four buttons , channel up and down , volume left , i've we have to keep that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's the let's make the let's make the case plastic .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the power button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then and the power button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's the basic .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that that's what you need anyway .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then for the menu , you can have button that activates menu .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or do we just integrate an scroll-wheel with push-button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then if the moment you use the scroll-wheel , the menu gets activated , and then you can

it's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then you only need one button to move back .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or under each option , you set an screen thing what says back , and you select that one , click again , and you go one step back .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and in that menu , scroll , click , one step back .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that then you need five buttons , and one integrated scroll-wheel push-button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which that's even , if you go to eight how to , we need the chip for the l_c_ display .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we can't drop three buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's one euro more expensive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but see that's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's not good idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's not an option .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because which buttons do we have now ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "those five which mentioned , and then menu , and then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "menu , power .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "of the four things ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so four arrows ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have back and button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's seven , and one to activate the menu , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the menu .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's eight .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can't reduce that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we keep the display .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and even if we drop three buttons from here , we still have to make some adjustments around here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we need the advanced instead of but that's not our market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then rather make it wood .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because then also it's good in the market with the forty five plus people .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but plastic with special colour .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no that not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it's better than plastic anyway .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , hard plastic .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "woo wood colour .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "plastic with special colour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's an option .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no but because we have to use the special colour anyway .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you forgot that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so let's go for the plastic .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we do one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and since it's not kinetic , it doesn't have to flip around that much ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's easy because plastic is free .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we still have problem of two euros .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we dropped ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no the buttons , those are really needed .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can't drop them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's an advanced chip-on-print .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you still need that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do we really need that advanced chip for an display ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the other option would be to go for the sample speaker , and which can use regular chip , wh which is six euros in total .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , keep the re .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that doesn't matter .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "rather keep the display .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because we already designed for it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the only option is an hand dynamo .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so and something else .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that but the integrated button ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no tha that's one euro , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the can't we fit all the buttons in an intreg integrated scroll push-button ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause that will save us one and half euro already .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then if then we have to scroll through lot of menus to be able to get where you want , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then integrated but that would make it not so easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no you would rec then you have then you still need two additional buttons believe .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not that important , easy to use , but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for the volume .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can use those .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "at least one for power .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's three buttons and this would cost .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's just as expensive as what we have now .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how many func functions can it have ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "up , down , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it can be power button as soon as it powered on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can go into you in you main menu , you can choose flip channel , you can choose sound options , any options .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you press it for like three seconds .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then you should do everything in the menu .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "on the screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it would save enough you can choose this , drop these , then we have half euro left .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause we don't have money and we want the screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we can still use power button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we'd alright .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it saves us four euros and it costs us two and half .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so let's see , we drop the price by one and half .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we'll be on it says here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we still have thirteen left .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so still half .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there goes the special co that would make it less appealing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "drop the special colour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's no option .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , it has to be curved .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we about the advanced chip we need for the display ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they made it very easy for us .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we made it hard for ourselves with the display , but it's feature .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't think persuade the management to say , this is better for the market so you sell more than buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wh what we could do is drop the special colour , and do the special colour for the buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's since we only have one button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but what is meant by special colour ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't it's grey , regular .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just something else than black or white .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "grey and rubber .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we definitely want the thing to be special colour though .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so rather have an hand dynamo than drop the colour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can still play with it then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but hand dynamo costs lot of energy to keep the screen working .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that isn't an option .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the display the but if you have to power the for ten minutes , then the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you only have to power it up when you wanna use it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no don't think the current status of chips are pretty energy conserving , no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's go for the hand dynamo then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you want an extra button ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or do we or do we do uncurved and flat ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "instead of it has to be curved and has to have that colour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no it has to be curved .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just put special colour of the buttons , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the most import we only have but come back to the drawing board then , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "instead of an additional power button ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or spe special form ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what is special , special form .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's for scroll without but it's just scroll-wheel which you can push down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we don't have any buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so do make it special colour then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's for the integrated button , also .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ma make it special colour then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "make it special colour and then it look fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so woah we're within budget .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just ma make it two special colours , but we only have one button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let's save it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's do it like this , because it does not lose our identity of the product as we all your designs are but that but that's the fun part of it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this was old .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "back to work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did save it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's silly 'cause we should have had this meeting before we start drawing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wanted to go , but wasn't allowed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so forgot to save this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what's the next phase ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this the last phase , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "by your humble p_m_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "first should have had prototype presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but as you saw that hadn't made no sense , because we had to drop it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we went straight into finance ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it was more important , so pushed up the agenda .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have produced something about that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it combines with product evaluation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we all have to keep in mind what has changed now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you put it in the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what we have left on the because evaluation is based on the initial user requirements .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's make it big .", "speaker": "D"},

what we have now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but now , in original design say two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then say three .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you say three , and you said al also three ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "say still two , but it has to be three then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you're marketing , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's made bold .", "speaker": "D"},
