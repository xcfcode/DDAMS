with the technical functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how can get this on the whiteboard ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "t's you dumped the file in the sh in the project document folder .",

.", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll just open new one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "open it there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have to say something .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "due to some technical problems haven't digitized the last the meeting minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but i'll make that happens next time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "about the get .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and i'll get this one in digital form too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're going to talk about working design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the method of the remote control is electrical energy , it activates chip in the remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's an electrical circuit which compose messages in the form of infrared signals to control the television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's nowadays very known , known technology .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the known technology can make cost very low .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's wild wide sale of remote controls in the world .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the components are very cheap .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", diodes , bat batteries and led lights , they're needed and they're everywhere available .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "again , it's fair price .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's common technology , like told , the circuit board , it's the most important part of the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can use for that fibreglass with copper wires , it's it is can be made as fast as printing paper .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's all very , they're making it all the time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it's not very specialised technology .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "haven't come to here , but i've got some images of remote controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they were not very trendy or just remote control like everyone knows .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so why should put it here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , but haven't made it because of the time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it's the technical side of the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll have to skip that part then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you don't t's problem to design the technical part of the remote control ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's gonna be easy ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but nothing restricted for user interface ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , it's just part of known technology , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "remote control is nothing special nowadays .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "regardless of what type of functions we want to implement .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "doesn't really matter .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't , because of the all the televisions there are few couple of televisions with the new functions , but is it useful to put them on standard remote ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the technical functions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we'll see later on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you got the same pictures as got , but got these two , and they're we have to focus on the one hand the expert view or the novice user .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's very much depending on the user requirements , don't know who's doing , but it that's very important to watch what functions there we want to put in remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "will there be some user requirements later on ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the ones i've received from the account manager .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll keep this in mind , and then discuss it later on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can put functions in it when , when we get the user requirements and we can update it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but this real this big distinction between this type of remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we should choose one we should not compromise but really choose for expert viewer or novice ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , agree .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what that's what you want trying to say .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you want try huge market , if you want to reach huge market , like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's really depending on how far the remote controls are already in use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "some of these , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "some of that will , but it will be more clear when we come to the some of the new requirements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there are at least basic functions , like just the channels one till nine , on and off switch , which must be clear with red button like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "most standard have volume , and mute function , and , the next and previous channel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's just basic what we need .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and from that on we can user requirements what we need more .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "joost was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets , and if there are any if you put more functions , more buttons , it's com becoming less trendy like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can just you can keep it in mind that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "haven't really found conclusion like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the with less buttons you can make more trendier , more trendier design , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", that's all have to say , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that was it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then the marketing expert can tell us something about the current market .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright , i've done some research for functional requirements .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the working method there were hundred one hundred people , how do you say , watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also filled out questionnaire with few questions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i've lined them up here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ask whether common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have found some interesting things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we do got market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "three out of four people claim to find remote controls ugly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if we make trendy design , we have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "three out of four users zaps lot , as quoted here from the results .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's quite lot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "relevant options are , power buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "although , only used once per hour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "channel selection , volume and buttons for text , and the more , other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and very much used .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "furthermore , fifty percent says they only use ten percent of the buttons on remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that doesn't say we got we can leave ninety percent off .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it says we shouldn't make it too complicated .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fifty percent also claims to have lost remote control very often in the room .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and an important thing here , the most important customers , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and elderly people , our market , are less interested in features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , what was thinking , wrong side .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we shouldn't implement too much features on our remote control , because elderly people will get lost .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "group features for higher usability , what was claiming in the previous meeting .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them on one button and make them accessible in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and , it there are lot of options there , so we can really make , how do you say , we can spare at buttons over there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , if you want to implement v_c_r_ and d_v_d_ options , group them in the button , not too .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "small buttons , so they won't be very , how do you say yes , won't be very present , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and trendy look , although seventy percent of the market is consists of elderly people who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever , it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that was what found .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then we i'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on what features we find important .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "some of the new requirements make some of your findings quite irrelevant , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because decided to put they have decide to put two additional requirements forward .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now see four .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's kinda strange .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that may be so , but , we can't just leave the teletext button off .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , agree .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's impossible , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , like on and off , and don't make lot of special put lot of special features on it to make it transparent or , it's just you want to be able to make use of teletext , but not to play with it that much .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not too much , no .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we have to think of that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the remote control should only be used for television .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time ma the time to market .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we should leave all d_v_d_ and v_c_r_ related features off completely .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that that's what they're trying to say .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our current customers are within the age group of forty plus .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "new products should reach new market with customers that are younger than forty .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on remote control and who were interested .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , they're not relevant because we are aiming at younger , but it is it's is dif it's fact that the that bigger market you're talking about , we already cover that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't really agree actually , to be honest .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's very small market which we will approach then if we want to reach customers younger than forty .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's only like thirty percent of the total market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "our company already sells remote control to the older people , but we also want , new customer group .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's the one we haven't covered yet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's what the problem is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we haven't got remote controls for , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can compromise little bit .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it's no , but we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not too much then , bu alright .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we can make remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group , but isn't that bad for an older person either .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "something else to know .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but what's our slogan ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you will have to look that up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the slogan puts fashion in electronics .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll have look .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we put the fashion in electronics .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's something about the , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it might be , let's make things better , but , let's go back to the agenda .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "sense and simplicity .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we've now had to the three presentations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we know about the new project requirements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that means we can , discuss on the remote control functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if make start , it's becoming more clear what remote control it's gonna be , and already talked about the you have familiar with the rem remote control that has the can opener underneath it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're looking for some , we we're looking for really simple remote control with only basic t_v_ functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to be honest , if our aim group is till forty , not older than forty , that's not very , we don't really need to have simple remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can implement more functions then , because the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology and therefore will be more yes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but wha but , but you sai you said that lot of functions aren't used .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's why lot of the use the requirements the account manager sent me , they are contradicting each other , because they want simpler design , and no other functions than just t_v_ , but they do aim at younger , ma but you we can make some discuss distinctions in what kin in the , know , in functions you have different equipment in your room , like t_v_ and d_v_d_ player .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so why should we put this function in ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "more people younger people are more looking for just trendy look than more functions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can , know , you can make very you can put very detailed functions regarding the t_v_ set on your remote control with the , audio settings and screen settings .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we don't want that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that was that became clear .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we don't want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we should put some func , know that the younger people will most likely have d_v_d_ player they want to , they want to control , remotely .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you said , but the functions are not in the remote control we're making .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , the user requirements of the new project requirements told us not to but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we should , should put some functions for other equipment on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but just the basic functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like rewind and wind , or what do you think ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you can put them under the same button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not much more than that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if as far as possible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or we can we could put behind the flip-flap or whatever .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but what do you think ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do should we implement features that or functions that to control other devices ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , you don't ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , new requirements say no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the new requirements say so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , but if it's too simple they won't use the remote control , they use their own with lot more functions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you can put play and stop and rewind .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's there is something most of the time these functions don't support the particular device as their own remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "lot of d_v_d_ players have some tricky settings with , exactly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , but we .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's wha no , you don't no , you don't need it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but for , v_c_r_ , that's better example in this case .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "on remote control for television you don't need to be able to programme the v_c_r_ to start recording at three p_m_ or whatever , just play , stop , rewind and fast forward .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we have to think we have to think d_v_d_ , so but from my experience it's kinda lot of d_v_d_ players , like forwarding , goes differently .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "know , but yes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's sometimes bit difficult .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we just leave the d_v_d_ functional , was thinking about putting it in , but concerning the project requirements and what you just said , we should focus on the t_v_ then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but just keep it simple and look more at no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it's just an complimentary remote and not universal one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you want to keep it simple , you can make universal remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's only for television .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , but there are but how wi how will you be able to handle whole market ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's just it should be something that is like gadget on your coffee table , and it's just for when you jump on the couch , you pick up the remote , the simple one , just to put on the television , nothing more .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but what televis , we we'll make this one trendy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there are dozen of dozens of remote controls that have yes , but you could put on the zap buttons you can put it to access all the same pages .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the user interface is easy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we will come to that , but ju first on the functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we should put zap buttons on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also numbers , to go to the specific channels .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the basic , basic functions , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , definitely , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", teletext button should be there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's too much integrated in the other .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but just one big teletext button , on and off .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and two or three other options , but not nothing more than that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "stop function is very useful .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you have page which consists of more pages , and you are not very quick reader , then it's very irritating if the next page shows up , but , use it very regularly , the action .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that becomes too difficult , it's not very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "re use it quite often .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", but you , you do , but i've never heard of it in the first place .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "will you look at the market .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we have to , and teletext is becoming outdated .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that that's kin getting too complex for our remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", it's sunday always use it for the , for the soccer , when you look , couple of weeks ago looked at the for the flights , and there are lot of flights in one page , so if , but true .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what you think .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but do you like to have such stop button ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or do you it's very rare and special function .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it goes , but that's we should do on the internet now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's why it was said in the use in the new requirements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you have seven pages , you can go up and down .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "lots of new televisions can store pages , and then you can just skip manually through them using we should just put one teletext button on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we meet the new requirements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we also meet the other thin you sh you just re we have to choose for the simple design , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", what functions do we have to decide on ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or do we if we have stif specifically name all the functions we want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have the zap and the volume .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should we do make them very big ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the zap button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's considered to be trendy also .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the plus and the minus button should be quite present , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but trendy , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or you should place them on , in special way ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can make joystick .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "something or somethin special way to zap through the it has to it has to be , and quick .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have to use it very quickly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it was true .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you grab the remote , your hands should be on top of the plus .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it the buttons should make it possible to zap through your channels in rapid at rapid pace .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what should we decide on then ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in case of this simple remote control , the technical aspects which weren't worked out already , but it shouldn't be problem then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but no , it's just signals and the television does the rest .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we the batteries .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , but we don't have to , when we don't want to control other devices , it makes it even more simple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you use large batteries or small batter batteries .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the most standard batteries .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that we should use , not the watch kind the most , it has to be simple , and wi which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the most ordinary batteries .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how much time do we ha we have left ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "more than thirty minutes ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "about twenty minutes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ten twenty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but in way we have to be special .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that's do you have you think about tha thought about that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how we can what the extra touch can be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget feature or , it was something about how we lose them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it should be remote control when you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's more for an age range or ten to twelve or whatever .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to find him .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "nah , lot of people like to have such kind gay things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it should be like birthday present that you give someone , and it is has something .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", that's good one , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or it should have big light that can flash on it , or it should or an or the like the can opener .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it contains some feature that you don't normally link to remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's very impor because we're gonna make such basic remote control , we have to do something to make it special .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's gonna cost twenty five euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ye the can opener is brilliant idea actually , because television and beer is not rare combination .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the , it's already been done .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but and it's gonna be very it has to be sturdy , so with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it has to be used something special , and you really it has to , not people , when they buy it , they have to think , this one lasts for long time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're really gonna use them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not some thing you throw away next week , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , that's true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's when we decide on these type of functions , know , basic functions , it's very important to find something like this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so there's very important task for you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we can all think about it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "be original , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "also for you , when you it's very when you can be entra when you can be trendy , and al as in friend use friendly as , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and use friendly , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so big buttons , flashy design , and some gadget thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "swapable front or whatever .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or just different colours would be if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it could be , you never know , but it and we have to make it quite big .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "more money for us .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , definitely .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "people so , and also because it is expensive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's to be formed for your hand .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you want it to be something , it's ha doesn't have much functions want to be you don't want to get it make it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , it should be visible nearly anywhere in the room .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as said during my presentation , fifty percent .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and shou and should ni look when you put it on table

{"text": "no , put inside it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "more like joystick then .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , it's like statue , but you also can put it somewhere near the window in that it's fashionable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", see what you mean , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's like you have four phones .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "something like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you do that , but if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and half euros .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in the base we could like make button , and if you push it , the remote control itself makes noise .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's probably stupid , but as found here , fifty percent , was it fifty ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that's fun for the first time , and then the second or you can .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "fifty percent often loses remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but when you when it gets lost , how can you press the button to make it , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , of the base the thing you put it in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "on the television .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if an button in that , you can ma make rechargeable one , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then also you don't even need batteries , because you can make it chargeable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that , but , the pro no , that it might be , nee but we don't .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you , but we much about production cost , but when you can imagine that when you spend twenty five euros on remote control and it's basic remote control , then the money there must be money to spend on that st , rechargeable units .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it should only cost twelve and half euros , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we would ma we'd do it in taiwan and so , it's not gonna be that expen it's idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it should be possible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's good idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "some be i've never seen that before , and you make it be , you see it with the mo the mouses nowadays .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to make base ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , definitely .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , but is that handy ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "t's really ch you can recharge it , so you ha never have the battery problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not the purpose to be handy , it's .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you can always find your remote control up , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but remote controls nowadays can last two years , three years , with two batteries .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", you could when that's when it's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger , but you will you do need also an , also you would need battery in the base unit as , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then you yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "does it makes it kinda , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or but you pay for it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that's not it's ugly , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but then it's very easy to make it also rechargeab don't think that is gonna cost much to make it also recharge function in it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "on the other hand , if you don't do it , we can also make bay .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it looks trendy and still put bleep function in it , but the bay is definitely , why not .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and make it , we it's it isn't most costly remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can save on the functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we just put some simple button in , make it big and sturdy , nothing more , and just make there's some noise that it can make , or probably some cheap light thing around it or that it lights up , it's also .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if you put it away , it's we have to we that's it's not easy market .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to something special .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and for twenty five euros people want something remote special from your mote control , and we can't deliver that in with regards to the functions , because we aren't gonna put .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with eye candy , ear candy , whatever .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then when make it , looking shape and this and then you also you got the stand-up thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it must be gadget to have .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it let's , we will see what's possible concerning the costs , and if it's possible we'll do that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we even try to save up on other to make we can do such thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the first thing we the most likeable thing to skip is then probably the recharge function .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if that's too expensive , we won't do that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we or just give beep when the battery's out or down .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it would be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it would be , yes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's the idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "know that batteries last long nowadays .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and what people just think about , i'll never have to buy any batteries again , so because it's very annoying when your battery is empty .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then when you haven't batteries around , and probably for two weeks , your remo i've experienced that , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty , so yes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , easy functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we will we'll work that out , zapping , numbers on it , bi .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it's also annoying .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause as long as it stays as it ke keeps working , you're not very motivated to do something about it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then it beeps all the time and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , that's true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you don't want to have ever have those problems , and you won't have if you have the rechargeable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you don't have to use the unit , you can also put it on the side if people don't like it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in the ma , but it , if they pay for it because they think , that's idea , i'm gonna use it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and when it , when time goes by and they think , i'll never put him in the recharger , last long enough , then they put it on side and they can use it now and then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then when they look get know for that everybody who buys this remote control , within couple of months of they will be in the situation that they they're seeking for the remote control , they wanna see something quick and just push the button and , it's brilliant .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "bleep , there it is , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i've never it's so simple , but i've never seen it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you can leave it just there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we should really do this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now , how much time have we got left ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "these clocks aren't synched .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now i've put , it is twenty , so we have ten minutes ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll fifteen minutes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "something like that , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we're done .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've decided on the functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there is some .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there is closing sheet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have lunch break , and then we have thirty minutes of individual work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll make i'll had some problems with the digitising the first minutes , the next minutes won't be problem , but i'll try to make the first one will be in the folder too , but it won't work , but you'll see .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "these are more important than the first ones , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can you make an part of folder for the minutes ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that not everything in one folder .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "maarten , five minutes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because did the first minutes did were bit scratchy , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then did second one with nicer layout , which could , know , use for the other ones , but think forgot to do put done under the first one , and when you go write second it's get it's not working when you try to write second paper .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , that's true , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then you had to overwrite it or someth .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "becau , it was not my pen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should we by the way draw on our whiteboard , little idea of .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this looks you like .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "of the shape .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or the sh do you get an idea of the shape ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "probably , it would be .", "speaker": "A"},

"B"}, {"text": "it has to feel in your hand .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have to say , have this can opening remote control in my head most of all , or some we should no , that will be too costly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we shou we could also , that was would also be an idea , but don't if it exists already , you should like make alessi design it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would also be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that's gonna then you don't , but then you don't have it that's not something that's in the production cost one it's one time , was it's single cost .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but twelve and half euros ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but then you can nah , don't thin that it would be more expensive , because i've bought the alessi more often and
