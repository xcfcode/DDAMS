meeting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "with the different perspectives of it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we'll begin with the front .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have the round shape the round basic shape .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "with the upper part being the front .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so there's this part which is made of hard plastic , the front .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we're using different colours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for the launch we use the basic ugly colours , and later we'll put out more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then we have the lower part of the device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which is part of the back actually , because it's also titanium .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can see it also on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under side of it , the back side and the lower part of the front is titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour , the look .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then we have on back on the front the logo in the upper corner , which is made which is also part of the back , part of the titanium part .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's double , but it's double .", "speaker":

that's the logo in the upper lef corner .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then we have the buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round oval will be better

middle here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "channel up and volume ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "with arrow shapes , which makes it also bit more exciting than basic round or square buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also here are the two buttons we on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have the button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "nei we the button's here in the middle of the operators , of the channel and volume changers .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then we've here the menu button and the video button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "menu for the screen .", "speaker":

"speaker": "B"}, {"text": "with the logo and our no don't think and the and about the side view this the front won't be as thick , but again the drawing technique makes it very difficult to really , it won't be visible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we thought about , the back is titanium .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we thought about the logo big in the middle .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just so again the double .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have then the logo on front and on the back .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's too much but you have to say that if you think that way .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the company slogan , we thought in arc shape above the logo .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's what we were thinking about , and before forget .", "speaker":

that it lies over your hands .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "fits it fits the hand , mean the in the middle in the that's the question .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but what agree is that when you have such of an arc in the middle , so that the ends and the fronts is bit thicker , so then it falls over your hands .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you handle remote , you usually don't have your hand straight like this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have it bit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it depends on the size .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it's kinda small , this is .", "speaker":

do you suggest we do ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this was mike's prototype , and you seemed to on it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the sides haven't seen yet , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but now you have different .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they lay there all the time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the size doesn't really matter side ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they the side view , we didn't .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we he drew the side , but you weren't paying attention as usual .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "any case , we'll discuss it now .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is pretty good idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "agree with the screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you have it in your palm like this , and you can watch the screen .", "speaker": "D"},

telephone .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because if you have screen on it , you wanna look at your screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so and you can grab it bit higher , so ll the that's reason to put the screen on the upper side , but if necessary .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that way , it falls into your hand .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "agree on this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , don't .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's not the point and you might be you might be target customer .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no but for as far as see , three of us agree and only nils but you're the project manager , you can make the hard decisions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you three agree then that's it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , we'll we we'll do it like this .",

when my personal taste is that want it to fall over my hands with thick but in the market no not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but do you but you don't think this is completely unusable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not , but you are also human .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for me , wouldn't buy it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's say it like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to take every everyone into account .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no yes but , we , but that's more market research .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "who else thinks like you ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "thousand people , or million people .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so let it be like this at this moment .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let it be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "any other suggestions ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , it's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but what about the redesigning ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "comes to that later .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can walter .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you're very personal again .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can do the evaluation criteria on this ?",

"D"}, {"text": "that's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so made few questions on the hand of the impor most important requirements and trends .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we have to look if our device is working correctly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "put some questions in word file .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "see if find them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "think you have all seen this evaluation , so don't have to explain it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the first question is , is the device good-looking ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because normal most people thought that earlier devices were ugly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "seventy five percent of them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what do we think ?",

"speaker": "D"}, {"text": "designed it to be good-looking .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so have to take this questionnaire .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so and we ha we have answer now ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to the customers ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but 't can , but , we dis we di we designed it to be perfect .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "know , know .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but can go , because of the time , pretty quick through this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do we find it good-looking ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it let's start with the beginning , just one by one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we designed it to be good-looking , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so but we have to be critic critical about it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and have to take all these points and get average at the end .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we know where we stand .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause there are some things we might have bi might have forgotten .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's point four .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "easy to find two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it good-looking ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's pointed towards the youth , if you look at the design and the colours and everything .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that was our target audience .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it's also not completely unacceptable for older people .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's not device that , that's for older people , it's more that classical look .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the titanium might be for older people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it you put black front on it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they like black , but they'll they think the titanium look of it is also it's also good for them , so we both have consider considered the youth and also bit older people .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's very good-looking and not only for youth young people .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we shouldn't discuss any points that long , because how many points there are but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have to get on , go through this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it easy to change channels ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the last one is seven .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "easy to change channels ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no it's with two huge buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , not false .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have to go through it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's as easy as can be made .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you how can you make it any easier ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible

"speaker": "A"}, {"text": "t's easier to find than normal black one , because of the colour .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we have so few functions , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't have the device that beeps when you lost it or so , but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "are the functions easy to learn ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we do want we have less of an and the device r_s_i_ sensitive ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should two , because the voice recorder is not self learning .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but just do some we this is too time consuming .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are we take too much time ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not towards you , but towards this all .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is we you have to put it to the customers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ll bit , so four .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and features included also one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "those nine is the fancy-looking .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "device fancy feeling .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and fancy-feeling too , because of the titanium back .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "are there enough technology ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also we have two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is the device easy to use ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes we have not many buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so two because of the voice recorder .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "with the three .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "two , three .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our covers , in our fronts .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so yes , one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one or two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is the material attractive ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one or two , another two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you look at this no .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it doesn't really resemble any fruit , that's true .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we have the sparkly fruity colours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "three , alright .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and you can also have front with fruit on it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is the material attractive ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the titanium is strong , and the rest the buttons feel soft .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so would say at least two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is the last meeting ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , but we have to design much more , because there was some irritating account manager coming to me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the average will come later .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "knew things were going too smoothly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there had to be some trouble along the way .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "look at the costs at this point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "had to fit it in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it has to go to twelve , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "twelve and half .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "twelve and half .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what costs lot ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the sample spea costs four .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the tha that's bit an optional option .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the sample speaker , the sensor .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "kick it out .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "kick it out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to go to twelve and half .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the speaker costs far , by far the most .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's some wrong info , man .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it isn't worth it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we could make two different versions , one with and one without .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's just extra .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but for this so , zero .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "kick it out .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then we go to fourteen point six .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the titanium don't want to lose actually .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "batteries are quite no , no .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "come on , remote control has battery .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ll why should we use advanced chip ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have bit of problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because the screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "be for the you had said .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can't we do that with regular chip ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because that because my information says it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what what's the difference between simple and regular ?",

have to lose the screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then you only have one half left .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you must change the chip back .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you must change the chip back , nils .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , then the whole concept is you can make you can make it cheaper .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "know but that's what my information says .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "di didn't put the advanced chip in there for fun .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no we you we have an advanced chip-on-print , and we have an l_c_ display .", "speaker":

.", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and what do they mean with curves again ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because we you have uncurved .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "did single curve to you said double

it's how you look at it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , it's one curve .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one curve , simple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we have huge problem .", "speaker":

one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you make people brand-aware , they are willing to pay more .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but because we use brand at the front and dun at the back .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you'll agree that we that now we have this screen , it's very not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you have lots of marketing people might buy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or we could replace it why don't we replace the titanium with plastic coloured titanium , titanium-coloured plastic ?",

"speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that is pretty stupid .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but i'm don't agree .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you want to dump the titanium ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to get cheaper .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and make all plastic , then we ha then we're there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then we we've got to run through the eval evaluation process again .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the titanium just provided the tough look and the and also the older people will like it because of that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then you have ugly , stupid , ugly looking , dumb remote that no-one would buy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not ugly looking .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the looks remain the same .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , don't .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the feel , and that it is strong , and we still we had to focus to get more people from the younger group , but not lose the one why can't i'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the lowest price you can make remote for that's trendy these days .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and because alright it's not our target audience , but it's useful if it's important for old people .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the titanium is very important .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then we won't get there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have problem , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you can better , dump the screen then .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can dump the special colour .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we use plastic .",

, thi this is really good re remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is good , but it it's not good enough .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "osl if you don't have the money , you can't make it .",
