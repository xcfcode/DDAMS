afterwards .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you are gonna give us presentation of our wonder product that see some demonstrations of over there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we're gonna evaluate it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we're gonna talk about finance , and i've got lovely excel spreadsheet that knocked up in the last five minutes for this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "bra that's like it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you knocked it up ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we're gonna evaluate the product and close .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "got forty minutes to do this in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we should be fine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's try and keep this one on schedule .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so your thing is in where is it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it in who wants it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "three , three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the end product thingy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "pedro can have it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like i'll help talk .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what we ended up with .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and the research department , which is us , is fifteen point eight euros , someone forgot the units there , unit price unit production price cost thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we implemented the basic functions , which is just t_v_ functions plus the locator , which was one of the marketing things , cradle , scroll wheel for the channels , and we implemented the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping , your favourite channels functionality , in the scroll .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "zapping your favourite channels , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "scrolling through your favourites list .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's just portuguese thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that was the result .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like the logo on there as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's very prominent .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it is very prominent .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so here i'll give you the so this is the cradle unit , and this is the actual remote itself .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this green little scrolly guy here , and then the volume controls are here and here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you've got the keypad which is the numbers from zero to nine and then ten .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is the power button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have our we have the enter button and what was the other button here ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is the teletext .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "start the start to programme .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the programme button , the programme button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming your the type of television you wanna use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the plastic is the white area of this of the model here , and the red area is like rubber covering .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can see that when it lays like this or like this and the buttons are all gonna be rubber , so it's pretty hard to actually damage it that might be possible mi possible problem , but if you drop it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it depends on the stiffness little of it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it depends on if it's sliding , but it's pretty ergonomic .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can feel it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is clay .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have to reach little bit don't you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the power button is bit of reach , but we might scale down the final model bit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that wouldn't make sense .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "these this is bit larger than it would be , but pedro can demonstrate the paging ability .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't have no one to handle that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and hold it so wh what's the marketing perspective ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you gave me more than was asking for , so i'm happy because we've got some really marketable features in this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you ha you have like the base station with the little button for the where's my remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "pla i'm ha it's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the locator function .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "beep so beep be shut up .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so let me get it , if press this button see .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wicked isn't it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he'll be across town , see that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "plan to do that as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no tha that's alri exactly that's exactly what those are for .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the two blue are those for the it to charge off of in ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and there's one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it , is you could beep we were thinking that it might be interesting to have trigger button here because you have this finger it it's it kinda feels like there should be something there , but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's the shape isn't it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if you had trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the problem of it landing and scrolling , 'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so in final design phase we might tweak that little bit , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as based on that , hasn't it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so is that the final colour scheme as or ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no this is just what we had to work with at the time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it came off .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the scroll wheels , problem with them not being don't think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my suggestion is we're gonna go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "some blend of silvers and blacks .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "enough of that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so are we done with the this presentation ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you're not gonna find my folder up there gotta do mine up at the board .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so no it's not in there because had the computer problem and cou couldn't create it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can not get your get at from your shared folder now ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "couldn't create it in the powerpoint , and i've got this really strange cable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what had , going from the powerpoint format , is that like this lot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to changing situations in the meeting room ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what we had is we had the method .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's not how you spell method , is it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this doesn't go so fast this way .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and when speak about method speak about the marketing of the product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and to me with this product we got three things to market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we've got the features , we have the characteristics , and we have the what we would call the other part what we call the corp corporate help me .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the corporation stands behind the product , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the features we got the scroll , we've got the locator , we've got the durability , we've got the dependability , we've got the features that make this unique product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it fell off .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the characteristics talk about , we have reliability , we have comfort , we have ergonomics , we have environmentally sensitive .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the corporation , we're talking about we're new company .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're wanting to make name for ourself .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're wanting you to find our product so we're gonna give you good product at fair price .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one thing would want to see is can we get lifetime guarantee on this product , normal use guarantee , which means that this product , for the life of the life use , if it should have technical problem , that we could re replace it at no cost ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that was something would be interested in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so without going into details , we have product , it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , believe , to make it marketable believe at cost of thirty five to fifty euros .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're gonna be competitive , and we're gonna have market niche .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that would be that would be decision best made by corporate for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , that we can go after this and go after more of the exclusivity sense than the mass market sense .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you would you argue that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but i'm sh i'm open to market this in either direction .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you came up with product , and at that cost it there's nobody else that's putting this combination of ingredients together .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the only limitations see to this is that we're focused on television only .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's the only that's the only drawback see to this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but with all of these other features people one thing i'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there's gonna be somebody going home and say sh this thing doesn't work for my d_v_d_ and my but like these other things , so they keep it , they don't take it back .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for later version with those features quite simply anyway , aren't we ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's no fundamentally different technology to do that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one of the thoughts that had is can this unit be produced in way that makes it upgradable ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like sim card in telephone .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is there card in can we make card and so after , but you follow what i'm 'cause if we can make this unit upgradable then we're but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything , but that's that was just an idea had .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we need some more buttons if it would to work on some other , but we could get another version of it that actually works .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but very co very colf colourful .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to me the only additions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the plus there's the risk of making it unusable as , or making it less because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look the buttons , what they do , it's very simple , and it just works .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's risk of that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but anyway that's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we can talk about finance now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so have little spreadsheet for us where was wondering , you when you talked about the fifteen point eight euros , was wondering how you came up with that figure ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that was just our technical team added up the production costs of the individual units .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so have bit of spreadsheet here for this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now i've made few assumptions here in that i'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for cost of four euros , equivalent to solar cells , which is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and i'm assuming that the locator beacon , the can be made for it sounded different that time can be made for similar price to an l_c_ display , an do you think that's fair coming from the manufacturing ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do think we that we don't need the events chip on print , we only need the regular chip on print , so there may have been miscalculation in there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we're down to sixteen point four , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we have single-curved that it's single-curved , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that single-curved rather than double-curved ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're not entirely what single-curve versus double-cur you think ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've got curve and droop .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we save one euro that way , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we come bring it down to fifteen point four .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see it's little bit more than single-curved .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's fifteen point eight , that's where we came up with it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do don't speak so it's in here , in that do we have any we have special form don't we ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the we haven't talked about any special colour though don't if we're going for greys and silvers then don't think we're so we're push-button , scroll wheel , we're we have is this intended to be button as or just scroll ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's that's not very special , it's pretty if .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we don't it's scroll .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's not one of the scrolls where , with this one you could push it down to be button ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no we just use it as scroll .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then we have fifteen point eight euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it was pretty accurate estimate would say .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it wasn't bad .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're on to the we're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation , where we have look at the criterias that paul the criterion criteria that paul has given us , and we can use that to tell how's it going ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'s frighteningly accurate .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "anyone got any thoughts ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how have we done today ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we did pretty .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we did pretty too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that looks pretty spectacular .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , we come up with attractive marketable product and concept .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "any other chang thoughts ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what about room for creativity ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "sh there was plenty of room .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we ended up being quite creative there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we got couple innovative ideas .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we kinda broke we kinda at least adjusted every criteria they gave us because we still have the teletext capability in this thing , we raised the price of it , we've added two new technology to it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if this thing flies then we've adjusted or broken every idea they gave us .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not every idea necessarily , it's still remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no but we did break with the specs little bit , but the leadership , what do we report back to the bosses ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but like when say we have we had believe we have room for creativity 'cause this is we did it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no they were reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it was more of teamwork thing then really leadership based project was teamwork .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there was lot of synergy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "teamwork , he is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what did we think of the meeting room , is an important thing here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "these cables suck .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this falls off and the white board worked really without any pro , lapel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's you must have very long shirts .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's way far down lapel mic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wha , alright .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's almost crotch mi cr dear .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's it's down , it's quite close .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what they're gonna have on the recording in there from that microphone is your lunch digesting new ideas for the product or for the environment or what are we ta .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "keep it , keep it calm .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no more pizza for me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the pen came in alright and it's little uncomfortable to use but it works .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause this is you were using it upside down .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "still that use them like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's our boss .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "nah , i'm not convinced of that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i've been wor i've been wondering about day , but see these look like they're that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around , but it feels more comfortable , wh what you call upside-down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that data might be slightly invalid .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what new ideas have we found ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wel had the favourites list , and the scroll bar , and we have the cradle , and the remote call feature .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let's do both then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for the product ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we came up with quite bit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "bunch of new ideas .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and for the meeting room , has anyone got any more less sore on the ears .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "comfortable headsets would be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "clearly remote control microphones would be the would be solution to all these cables , but i'm that there's some justification for these things that about .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's not been it's not been cooperating so , but don't think that's the that's avoidable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "coulda been worse .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so are the costs within the budget ?", "speaker": "A"},

twenty euros to build , so we're good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the costs within the budget ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not the original budget , but they are now .", "speaker": "A"},

that got there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "who wrote that one ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we need to close this meeting , bravo .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i've got lot of paperwork to
