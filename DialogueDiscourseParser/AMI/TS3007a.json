"speaker": "B"}, {"text": "with the interface , it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that might be easier .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but at the

"A"}, {"text": "now we're gonna dig into the to the serious .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's pretty abstract .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the selling price for the remote will be twenty five euro , and the production cost may not be more than twenty and half euro .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so from my point of view , don't t's gonna be very high tech , high definition , ultra modern kinda remote , for twelve fift twelve and half euro .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the profit we must make with the new remote is fifty million euro .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's lot .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to sell lot of when the selling price is twenty five , you got two million , two million remotes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how much is it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like how much ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "hundred million remotes ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "two million , two million .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but our marketing range is , market range is international .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we have virtually the whole world we can sell we can sell our remotes to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "at least that countries which have television .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so now it's time for us to going to discuss little things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can think about experience with remote control yourself , at home .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what you think might be useful new feature .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so let's discuss little .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm gonna join you at the table .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what what's the most important thing at remote control ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the most important thing of remote control is that you can switch channels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it possible to open pen drawings in this on this screen ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so not remote control who which can be used for television and d_v_d_ and radio and or just only if you have them on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but have some points .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can show them on the big screen ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in case you want it this is dead fly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "between the , be the screens .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "only all the drawings go there , at the left , that pen drawings .", "speaker": "A"},

"speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have some points from marketing point of view .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just the standard thing li things like intuitive , small , fairly cheap .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's pretty cheap , twenty five euros .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it doesn't have to matter which brand your t_v_ or other thing is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll wrap it up quickly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "personally has to be multi-purpose .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "most of the remote controls are just for one purpose .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and by making it multi-purpose , it has new feature , adds new feature to the market , and distinguish from current products .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "some other technology than infrared .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "rather find it very annoying , like when someone is standing in front of the t_v_ then you can't switch it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "think about sending it over radio waves or bluetooth .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that might be little bit expensive .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and something like an screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for what purpose ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like said here it's easy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's as an added feature , that , when you're on certain channel , you can see on the screen what programmes are coming up or from my point of view , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it be multi-purpose very technically high remote ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it must be really innovative , technical-wise ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it has to be , our company is very good in making new innovative things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , agree with you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so to the current market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we and the price .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we must focus on things who are really add something to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "look , you got some cheap remote controls there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they just , you got dozen of .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but when you enter new market with remote control and wanna gain market share you have to do something special , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we have to keep an eye that it's at the beginning of such project , it's very to talk about , this would be , that would be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we must not lose sight of the user friendly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it's but this is just from marketing aspect .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "anything about user interface or design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that's because we have him .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "next meeting will start in thirty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you will have individual actions where presume will be some feedback , via the mail .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the industrial designer has to look at the working design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the user interface designer has to look at the technical functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's the thing we discussed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one thing , we must first agree on what we're going to make .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do we are we going to use it for multiple systems ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or we should have some agreement on that before we .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't think we have to be , we have to agree on that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's phase further .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ju just make some mock-ups , some general ideas .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then we can plan .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can plan further , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , because you are working on the user requirements , you are working on the technical functions , we must have little or kinda how do you call it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "consensus on the , what we're gonna do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "little plan on what we're going to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you don't come up with the user requirements who don't fit the technical functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "some basic things we co we want to going to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "will come in handy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you're the project manager .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if the technical functions have to be designed , i've gotta know for what machines they will be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or do we use it text screen ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or will it be with bluetooth or .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's really step further .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if you say is it one way or multi-purpose , that's why ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "tha that's same step further .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "actually it is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then looking at individual components , so that's actually step further .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like we all have list of things that has to that have to be in it , or how it has to be like .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then in the next meeting we decide what it's gonna be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can take it from there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "agree , we can take it from there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then you can delete the obsolete details .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so each individually must think on what's at his point of view is the most important .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we're going to fit all the pieces together the next meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "must finish off now , so it's over .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you will receive specific instructions by your
