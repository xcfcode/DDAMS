we came up with some general ideas of our design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what materials we're gonna use , and that thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the meeting will be forty minutes long .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we will once again have poppy as our first presenter .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright , and will switch up powerpoint .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should be just loading .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "although 't see it on my screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that says go here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i've been doing some research into the different components that we could use , what's available to us to actually make the remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made , and what is it happens inside the casing , which is more your field .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "thes main internal feature is circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is not necessarily battery , as we're about to see .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there are several components of , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we'll be getting them from , what they'll be made of .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "including the integrated circuit , which is also known as the chip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is where all the main information is contained .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "diodes , transistors , resonators , resistors , and capacit capacitors all need to be considered as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and all their positioning in the circuit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "are they all included , like mandatorily , or are these different options ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "these , they're all different options , they're all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy simple , regular , advanced .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can go into that later .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "all the other things are individual components that we'd have to get in separately , and work out the most , like , effective circuit , including all the wires and everything like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the l_e_d_ , that's light emitting diode .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , we could , so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could use basic battery , but that brings with it , like they need to be recharged and the bulk , the size of it as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and they're not so to dispose of , environmentally .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's hand-powered dynamo which is thing that was used for torches fifty years ago .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "bit out of date .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what is hand-powered dynamo ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "where you manually charge up the power .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like you wind up something .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just every , every once in while ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just every once in while or constantly ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "every once in while .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it'd be strange to always be cranking it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it would be like going step back in time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't would really be with cutting edge technology .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "whereas kinetic energy is new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or there's solar power , which we've been considering inside building , which is where it's gonna be used , might not be quite so useful .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , good to look into , renewable energy , always the way .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "lots of considerations for the case , like what shape it would be , curved or flat .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's got lot to do with the ergonomics .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like how it's comfortable and sits in the hand .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or too small .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or too slidy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'ve had remote control before which you couldn't tell which was the front and the back , 'cause it had so many buttons on , and the shape was so symmetrical that i'd be pressing like volume button instead of the on button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because you can't really see which way round it is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we also can choose what materials , the we could use metal , we could use rubber which might be more ideal for the anti-r_s_i_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's like the same rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that , so it's very like soft , not so stressful on your hands .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "again , stepping back in time again there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "titanium is not gonna be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , would've been for future projects .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "our choice for buttons as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we've developed some we've got some good advances in technology , with our research team have found some new multiple option scroll buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that was brought up for , they're quite flexible design , modern , you don't have to use individual buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can just slide up and down .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm we're all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one thing with the scroll buttons though .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it , it we would have to have an display , and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that would lead to an advanced .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we have .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're going on to that later with the advanc with the that means we'd need really advanced chip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it's unlikely that that's gonna be in our budget .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "also we've got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we're most familiar with .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's the most straightforward .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you can in like incorporate that with scroll button as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "got decisions to make there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and this is what was just saying before .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "linked in the different depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "simple would go with the pushbutton .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "regular you could link with the scroll button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the advanced we'd have to go with display .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my personal preferences ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could go for the kinetic energy source .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't , that's quite an advanced technology .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's not been seen before , so it could be quite , novelty factor , attractive as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy , you don't need an external battery supply or solar panels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you just give it shake .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "sounds brilliant to me .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "rubber casing thing would probably the best , if we're going for the anti-r_s_i_ and like more choice with aesthetics .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like it could be any colour we want .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and gives you , more flexibility there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple , then we could possibly have the scroll and the push , but no , 'cause we probably can't afford that one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as like as the exterior .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is the one thing that's protecting its innards .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would , there would be an in more internal casing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the rubber would just be the , what's in contact with the human .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "another thing is it might be more difficult if it's rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it don't see how like rubber plate going on top it would stay there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like if it was like clip-on plastic plate .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it would work that way .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if the , if it was just , more of rubber coating which was on to case .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like plastic with rubber , on top , there's , there is certain phone that has like rubber casing , like nokia it is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , it was , the whole thing would be removable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like 't think of what .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or like an you can get outer casing for ipods and something , that's just it's protective as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like the skin ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it , it stops it , it would reduce the impact if it was dropped , as , 'cause it wouldn't damage itself so easily .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "mixture of both there , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the buttons are rubber .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that sounds good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as far as know .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it should be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we'll just say .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , just why not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like the kinetic energy source idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when people will , be moving remote around lot .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that it's worth it , kinetety , kinetic energy source .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it could make an we could have any style .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it wouldn't be as heavy or bulky , and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just for environmental reasons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's bit scary 'cause it hasn't been done before .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it seems we'd have to do more research on it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or if you could have battery pack .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like as backup .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so there's there is one battery , because most remotes use two batteries believe .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , if it was running off of one battery as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that would be good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "some alternative just in case something went wrong .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could you were saying about solar power ma not working indoors , but lot of calculators , have solar power .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "thought of that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that could be incorporated as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "may that could be the backup .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "instead of battery .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "although it needs some light , doesn't it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like solar backup .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do , do those calculators .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "suppose but some but thing is , it's not you don't need the solar all the time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can watch t_v_ in the dark then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , if we're doing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how it works .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it can be stored .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it can be like you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it just needs to be in light for certain amount of time per day .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like few hours day .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that might be little impractical though .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "sometimes it's just shoved under , under cushion , and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it could easily .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like people don't wanna have to worry about that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think , no , forgot to charge my remote today .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like if the kinetic thing , what's best about that is that it's instant energy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you don't have to , you can shake it few times , or whatever .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it works .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or just like pick it up when you're gonna use it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "instead of you don't have to like make it's in the place to charge and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'s that the end of your presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's not on my screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it wasn't on mine either .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", used the mouse on there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it that one ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "first of all i'll explain what user interface is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's the aspects of computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived , heard or felt , or by the human user .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are two types of user interfaces .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's the graphical user interface , which emphasises the use of pictures for output and pointing device , mouse for input control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's like the scroll thing we were talking about .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm not really about the pictures that that's on an screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or it's the buttons or pictures .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you t's .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so suppose sometime after you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at keyboard , so the numbers are like keyboard .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you're pressing the numbers for , for what you want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you must , for the graphical user you must need some presentation for the graphics .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like an screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "suppose where on some buttons you would have like the power would be some symbol .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if you wanted to go onto teletext or , know we're not having that , but similar thing , you , they have there's like little picture with screen with lines across it , which suppose it's that thing like the , the symbol on the button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if we're having simplified display anyway , that , we probably won't have to focus so much on that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we'll be doing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it'll be more the on the numbers and the volume .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it'd be more command interface , and then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume , display , and like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's just draf graphical for the pointing aspect ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the infrared is like , that's considered .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the , that's on the buttons of the remote control , and per could be wee scroller thing , and something could come up on the screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so when it says pointing device that doesn't include .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they're talking about type things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we're gonna go with the command interface anyway , to make it more simplistic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the , we could incorporate some of the graphical user points , as in just to make it nicer to look at .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what do you mean ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like 't think of an example , but like little pictures rather than like little sound .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like how the buttons , as button though .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "instead of saying volume , like little speaker .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , it's keyboard in the shape of it , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like that idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the co we've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as it would be less complicated , and the controls would be more user-friendly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the remote control would be cheaper to design , so that we'd have more money in the budget to , target the design area of the interface .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "make it more trendy and original .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we'll have more money if we keep it simple .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "bit more too , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "seeing as it's quite new technology .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we , we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our , more user-friendly remote control , that lot of interfaces consist of clutter of buttons , that their functions , colours and forms aren't always helpful .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's in like the buttons with all the different like colours for different choices and things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it can be bit , overwhelming .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and interfaces are different .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , that doesn't improve the use of the produ product , so we need to come up with something that's easy to understand .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "does anyone have any questions ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour , just to keep it , give it simplistic look .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we go with the design plate thing , we'll have to .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just because of colour clashing , and if we wanted to , so and , and we might , depending on what comes out of the design , we might have to stick to just black buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but what about the lighting up effect ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you mean different colours for the lighting or .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", we had decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so if they were black , it wouldn't be possible for them to light up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see what you're saying .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you're picturing the light is coming from the back .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if they were white they would glow , probably .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if they were made out of rubber .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "kinda pictured it as coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , you mean from the back .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "where would the light come from ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'd assume , like , an internal light , that comes through .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so there would have to , have to be some parts transparent around the buttons , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and rubber is more translucent product too , so we have that taken care of .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it should be able to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in the phone that was thinking of as , when you change the covers of it , the little buttons that actually , that contro control , are behind the rubber .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you can change the buttons when you're changing the faces .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause it's just the wee control , thing that's behind it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they , they insert over .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , we don't have to decide on one colour .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "each face could have its own colour of buttons ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if they're raised up buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that you can feel them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we were talking about it being more , lot more tangible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that my turn then ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it might be more difficult to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if they're , if they're sticking up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if it's flat then , like on cellphone or mobile phone , it's like all very flat , and you just have to press down on these tiny little buttons , but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it would be possible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't would make that much difference .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the dimensions of it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of mobile phone .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then you get to the circuit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't would matter that the buttons were bigger through the , the top casing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm you could work it out to fit in the casing , without causing too much difficulty .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm that'd be fine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it's do-able we can do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "sounds good to me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's everything , then ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that means you're up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have shorter report for you today .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it took while to get this , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you're not plugged in yet .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's very good point .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , this report is about trend-watching .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we can live up to our , our purpose of having very fashionable remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , just so , my method was mainly web web-based research this time around .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "also spoke with fashion experts in milan , new york and paris .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and looked at the design reports from previous years , here at real remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just so we can work off of them , see how fashions have changed .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so i'll list the three most important aspects that i've come across .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and they , they're each more important than the one that comes after it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the first one is that there should be fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look-and-feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this should be our priority , as we've been saying .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the second most important aspect is that remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , we've done lot of talking about that , just with lighting and the buttons and the face-plates .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it looks like we'll be able to keep on track with that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , pretty basic there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the recent fashion update , according to fashion-watchers in paris and milan , is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "also , in contra in contrast to last year , the feel of the material is expected to be spongy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "again , we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , my personal preferences here , as we , we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting , and i'd like to stick to that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the fruits and vegetable themes , if that's going to work for us .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it sounds something that you'd use on kitchenware .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we wanna do it on remotes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it could be one of the options .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for the television that people have in their kitchen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the temporary light-up idea , sounds like we're gonna stick to that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then , tying in trendy look with user-friendliness .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that find rather jarring .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "everything else we can really , we can really , do , according to our plans already , given the market .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it is strange .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but fruits and vegetables seems very strange idea for remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's , it's little but it , it's everywhere .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we possibly could take more abstract design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we i've seen lot of purses with olives on them , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , if we stick to t_v_ based , t_v_ shows , or colour schemes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but they still need to fit into people's decor though .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we don't have to make something in the shape of strawberry , but it could have the curves of strawberry , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the essence of strawberry .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or strawberry seed or leaf .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or just like really make it quite abstract , if that's fits in more with what we're doing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "instead of fruits and vegetables , just if you look at it straightforward , it's bit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it doesn't quite fit in with the trendy , it does , if that's the current theme .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but may we could go more directly , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but initially , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we just tone it down bit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "tone it down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and like not , not .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like more like photos of fruit , on our product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one thing was thinking though is if you all remember from our kickoff meeting , we talked about our favourite animals .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so there could be animal-based , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because lot of people have house cat .",

{"text": "but it's something to keep in mind .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , did you have any questions ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright , given that information , we need to start making some more specific decisions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'll need to hook up the powerpoint again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have you been saving your powerpoint presentations to the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "didn't for the first one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but have now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it's still around ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "where do you have to save it to ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm just trying to make this pop up now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here we go .", "speaker": "A"},

"speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does anyone know how to take it out of , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so back to decisions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "energy , we've decided on kinetic , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are we going to have backup ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or do we just we could just go for the kinetic energy , and be bold and innovative , and hope this works , and hope that it works .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but would backup really be necessary ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "will people just use the battery if there's no , if there's , if there is backup .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's like no reason why it wouldn't work , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if it's not working they just have to shake it bit and that revitalises it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we should just like take advantage of like using this to its full potential .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it could even be one of our selling points .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "go for it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it could be fully kinetic energy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is everyone happy with that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "alright , the next decision is chip on print .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't exactly that means .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it was whether we went for the simple , the regular , or the advanced chip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that linked in with what buttons we would gonna have , so , it was so that was without the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we were going for more simplistic style , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that means we're not doing the advanced .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we decided on the pushbuttons , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's the simple .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would we need more advanced one for the lighting , the interior lighting system ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , it's probably gonna be the regular chip that we're going to need .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's medium .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so regular chip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's called medium , or regular ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is regular not simple ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's for the lighting , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "does this , is this dependent on shape , or what it's made of , or what ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is just like gonna be the very outer case , which we will decide on rubber .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "plastic and coated in rubber .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "plastic with rubber coating and interchangeable , interchangeable plates .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "plastic rubber coat .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "still going for that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "user interface concept .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is your time to shine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we decided on the component .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm , i've lost my powerpoint thing , so 't remember what it's ca it's the component the command inter the command line interface .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was called command interface .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was it ouch .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "command interface , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "did you say command line ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright , and supplements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that is haven't really made any decisions about what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions , colours and forms , in the in consistent use .",

and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we haven't really decided what to do about that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what are our choices here ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "t's just where shall we locate the buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what functions wi shall we have ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you mean like we'll have the numbers of the channels , and we'll have the channel-changer , and volume , and power ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so pretty just the basic button functions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like if we should go into like adjusting light levels , things like that , because different televisions will have , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "tone , contrast , and things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's bit , it was minima , it wasn't the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that was on , one of my presentations .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "about how often it was used .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you remember that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it was hardly ever used really .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should bring it up ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that would be good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and most televisions will come with remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television , so .", "speaker": "B"},

"you don't change that often , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "most of that comes like on the individual television set itself , doesn't it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm it has its own buttons , so you don't necessarily need to have it on remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and different televisions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like we , if we can make remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of changes like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're just going for power , channels , volume , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the other one was audio settings .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "mono , stereo , pitch .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "sometimes use that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "some t_v_s will have the option of like living room style , movie style , and that , they say that's used zero point eight times an hour , which is actually somewhat high .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like almost once an hour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "relevance of two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have five minutes to finish our meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", let's do this fast .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should we have audio ?",

work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we know that everyone has this and it's the same .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that it affects the marketing , 'cause it , it is good sales ploy to say , aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i've , that's it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this one has channel , volume and your channe and your power .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that could be sales pitch .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can just go for , make it selling point that it is just the basic .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text":
