[{"edus": [{"text": "hi everyone again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like before we have to redo the meetings from the minutes from the last meeting and so here we go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it was discussed in the last meeting which was opened by the presentation from the interface designer that looks would be very important on this new remote and it is to send messages to the t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it should have nine channel buttons , next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it should have memory switch , mute button in case the telephone rings .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "speech recognition is one of her very favourite personal features she would like see to be integrated in this new remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should be child friendly design with few buttons , colourful with star shaped or other shaped buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "she presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and she was challenged on that point .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but her very personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see speech recogniser integrated in this remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the industrial designer presented her thoughts on the issue .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "she would like special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "she would like to see timer and or alarm facility integrated .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "technically this thing would also have resistor and capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible rechargeable battery .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and circuit board .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse code related relays the to the generat to the generator amplification and the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is feature to consider .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "she would like this whole thing should be push buttons with simple chip scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should be battery operated and she would have the special cases .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the marketing expert who has to finally come up with to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used her personal observations to come up with the fact that such remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "from her point of view one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to do that one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really driven home .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it should have fruit and vegetable design and should have soft feel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "she feels that's really what people want today .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the decision that we took last time was that the special feature we would like to see is speech recogniser , the energy should be battery should be on chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now we are ready for the presentation of the prototype .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just the look like , the button part i'll explain .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is our what we have made .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is model of the remote control which we are going to build .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is us in snail shape so it is attractive and it's blue in colour bright and it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons so it is looks-wise it is beautiful .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also compact in shape .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also it will be easily fit into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you used to have all the buttons that's good , no , that's and friendly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the material which we are going to use for the case is plastic and which is strong and also for the material is plastic and for the buttons it is soft rubber and als .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then for the led , for the light emitting diode it is fluorescent green and it's it is bulb like an ordinary infrared .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the button button's part will be explained by francina .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now the we decided upon including certain features on our remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now these features includes the signal emitting signal it's the led or l_e_d_ the infrared .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now we have included the switch on and off button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now we have included another feature that is the mute button on the side of the model .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then we have included one to nine buttons for controlling the programmes the different channels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now our model also contains button which is called as the menu button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "menu , one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , menu at the centre we have included button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour , sharpness , brightness of this picture .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "of the screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have also included button which is called as the swapping button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now this is special , special feature which we have included .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the it will take to the previous channel , if it is turned towards the it will take to the next channel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is swapping button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the next channel in the numeric pattern , or , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , swapping is if example you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap , this button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and at the end , it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is our proposed model .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now the marketing expert has to give her suggestion whether it'll be sellable or it'll be cost effective .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what really like lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb , that you can really hold it in one you don't need two hands and it's easily reachable even for somebody with small hand , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes the buttons are all raised , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you don't have to turn it around , turn it upside down , move it up , up and down , really like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are raised , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or have two hands to operate it , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you really did good job on that , my little designers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and like the idea that the on-off button is in really prominent place .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's really good thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , and it sticks up so that you really you don't have to first go like here it's on and , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the colour's very attractive .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the these buttons around here are the mute and these on both sides they're mute ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , these the front buttons which are here , are the mute buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can push either one ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if you're left-handed or right-handed it doesn't matter .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and this brings the menu up on the screen ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is the menu yes , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the these two are to increase or decrease the volumes , and these two are to scroll the programme channels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "scroll up or scroll down the channels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it looks like something sell .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and now i'm supposed to .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have one question will there be anything written on the buttons , like that people know , or they have to learn that from piece of paper which button does what ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , it will have these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "will have symbols so that the user really knows and doesn't have to first learn it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , which can be easily recognised .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "good point because we need the symbols 'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but anyway it would ha it has to have some of symbols , text so that people kn .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can text .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "symbols on it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "text that we can have on the case itself , we can it will be printed on the case and symbols as the buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just wanted make of that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and one more feature is we have holder for this remote which is an oyster shape .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for the snail , we have the snail shell .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it is , shell .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , snail shell .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "he goes back into his shell .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow and we could have some little comic effect on our marketing about how this is rapid snail like that would , that would really work .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now what , what are our special features for the marketing ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so voice recognition is our big selling point 'cause nobody else seems to have that in this price range .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's really the voice recognition that's really unusual and then , and then the other thing would be sh shape or practicality of use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that everybody's gonna say their remote control is practical .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have to , we have to dwell on the appearance .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're really gonna have the be the cutest remote control on the block .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we have to play with the image , play with the snail image play with the visual and then the voice recognition .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "those are the two things to push .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the look and the voice recognition .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they're gonna be our two selling points .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now having said that no , now this was our evaluation criteria which we just have done .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm supposed to make little presentation , aren't ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now we're gonna talk about financing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but in my instructions it said was supposed to go to the board and do something .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there is production evaluation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that you ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that's after the financing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we had looks and voice recognition .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now on the financing we bring up the there it is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "energy source we say that's battery , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we use one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "cell or chart you are trying to change is protected .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "she told me could just ch change it here and then it would it doesn't work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can you just fill it in the yellow boxes ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", let's see .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "kinetic source so that's in the energy source that's all we need .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "electronics , simple chip on print ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that's what we're using ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one of those ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "regular chip on print .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's all we need , the one case , uncurved flat , single curved , double curved .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's double curved .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one of those ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "case materi supplements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "plastic we said , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wood , rubber ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "rubber , because we're gonna have the soft buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , yes but that's just for the case material , so special colours though , we having that , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that is for rubbers that is case material .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is this for the case ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the , mm' .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then we have to interface push buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "scroll wheel , no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "integrated scroll wheel , l_c_ display ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , 'cause we didn't put the clock in it after all , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "button supplement special colour ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "speci yes we do have special form .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and special material , rubber , wood , yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "total seven point six whatever that means .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's the price .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the price .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one two three four five six seven eight nine points , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it is it just .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "eight , eight point two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "eight point two , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , we looks like we are within budget .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should save this suppose , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "on the desktop .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my documents , computer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my compu here it is , yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ami should for .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "good , so that's the good news .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we gonna be popular .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that financing was pretty simple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now we would like to have presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll take my file down so you can bring it up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "should be able to get it now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "why don't you move just to the next slide away .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you wanna go to the next slide ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my method for the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups and see about any fine tuning that little things we haven't thought of .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can't accept every suggestion , but we just need to get few .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and show the prototype to consumer research groups , we don't want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we have to get some input from those people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and we like it , we t's good , we're gonna get behind it and sell it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now the things that was thinking and my wish list has really been realised in this prototype .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "wanted the shape to be biomorphic , didn't want anything with angles and all square , wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we've got that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the size is small , the colour's bright and warm which is what we wanted .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we'll have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped , even though it's gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand so that's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and functionality put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel and the shape , that's what people are gonna get in the store .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they don't have television in the store , they can't play with it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so they'll be our main selling points .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the shape is one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's really , really excellent shape .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the size is small and these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these aren't in how feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that it's plenty small enough to sell but we're the scale is one to seven .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're in the middle as far as other competitors .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and our colour is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the colours are bright and warm and we really do job there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and given the constraints that we had we got it as soft as possible .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then functionality you did really good job on functionality , we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else so would say that we got to five out of seven on functionality .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that we've got product and we can get off and running with it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "realised one thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we had what , eight euros twenty as our cost ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "eight , eight twenty , yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "eight twenty so we have four euros , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so we've got we've still got four euros to go to spend .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "maximum we have another four point three euros four thirty .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we have no way of presenting that to management as finished , as finished product and saying with the voice recogniser that costs so much .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we just have to beware of that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and know whether the four thirty will really cover that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as we today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the problem is quality .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as we've seen with so many of these kinds of products .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm to interrupt then but recog remembered that there was no that was not included that there was no room for any special features , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", even my , shape is one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so to beware of that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you wanna go to this next slide , marketing expert ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "isn't this my last slide ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes it is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that was my last slide , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and i'm supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we're supposed to talk about those things as team now , so if you put my last slide back up there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm i've forgot to do that , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "wh why you need that up ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because 't remember what put on there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now i'm supposed to see how long my leash is here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can make it there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so now we're all supposed to say what we think .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so on shape gave it one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what would you ra one being good and seven being the worst .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what do you think the shape is ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one , and be betsy ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes shape is one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and how about on size ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "on size gave it four , feel it's just average .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you gave it four .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would give it at least two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "even it is one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's quite small .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you're the designer , you wanna give it one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then how about how we doing on colour ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "colour , gave it one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "really like all those bright , warm colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like the colours .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and how about the feel ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "taking into consideration texture and comfort in the hand .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would give it two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "gave it three , two , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll give three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the next is functionality where admit was little hard on our team here , but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "t's also you can't really try it out the other things you have more is are more tangible so from that point of view but i'll give it three .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it looks like we've got ourselves pretty good product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the functionality's the only place where we have to think about , heaven forbid , having another meeting .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but otherwise we're ready to go with this product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "here is what we looking at satisfaction on room for creativity .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is there more room for creativity or are we happy ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can , include some more buttons and features .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can always improve , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , features .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can make the buttons few buttons smaller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they are quite big , so we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we want to have more features than that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then again if we're gonna do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the speech .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that that's where we're gonna have to do we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "definitely , two mu mute buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then we can do something with the volume control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can put on one button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and couple of other comp consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "al always bearing in mind that now we are within the budget and that we still we probably can't , with this particular item , we probably can't just add whole lot of more things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recogniser .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the question really is how do we feel with the project process ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "personally i'm pretty happy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm pretty happy with it too , it's something market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "even i'm happy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "an and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and team work was very good , we really .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you've done good job , miss leader .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , yes you've done good job .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do too we worked together as team , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we are we happy with the means we used ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we used whiteboard , we didn't use digital pens are these things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could've used the whiteboard little bit more , we didn't use that enough .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "whiteboard more , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , we could .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not in the best position in the room like sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody and from that point of view we ignored it little bit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we used the slide because it was better positioned .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , so , and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it little easier .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did we new did we find new ideas ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we were very good , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we did , in more than one respect and so we did very here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are the costs within budget ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is the project evaluated ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , yes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "cel celebration yes , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "today we have apple juice and after we sell million of we
