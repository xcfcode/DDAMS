[{"edus": [{"text": "good afternoon again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so here is the agenda for today .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting then we have presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we'll have presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the cost of the thing and hopefully we should fit the target tw of twelve point five euro .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so let's go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we went through we took this following decisions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , no speech recognition technology , we went through to banana look and feel for the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we went through the use of wheels and but buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and also the use of basis station for battery ch charging and also to call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so let this wonderful thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can go to the slides .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which is can you show it to the camera .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so final design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so michael you can go ahead .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so following our decision to make yellow to make banana remote so we actually have we've first of all we made an attractive base station with banana leaf look and feel and bana sit the banana sits in there nicely weighted so that it's not gonna tip over and this is the remote itself , it's ergonomic , it fits in the hand rather .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can pull it out first , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we've got the two scroll wheels here which one on the left for the volume and the one on the for the channel and underneath we have the turbo button which is in like trigger position for pressing quite naturally .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what's the use of the turbo button already ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is when you are scrolling the through the channels you can tell it to skip past channels that you quickly rather .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "an then you stop when you stop it stops .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but normally with it will just stay on each station briefly so you can see the picture .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we do have one more functionality .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you take the banana as such and you press the turbo button , so it switch ons the switch ons the t_v_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the turbo button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the turbo button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so rather than having an extra button for the on off switch you just use the turbo button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what this button for ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is teletext button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so once you press that then you get teletext and you can use the channel selector scroll wheel as to navigate .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to navigate it through teletext .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if you want to go to page seven hundred ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "with the wheel it's easy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how man don't understand it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then you can you have like little number selection thing , you press the teletext button to move between the fields and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have you go you scroll to seven and then zero and then you can press the teletext button and then you can and this is the infrared port .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can you repeat it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so then both the scroll buttons they are for teletext browsing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you can tele , once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext , they are no more for channel or vol volume .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also the top of the banana .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then we have in the base station we have the button at the front for calling the banana .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the leaves plays the roles of antennas ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually they do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's form and function in the one in the one object .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it always means , whatever the rays goes by they get reflected and then you are having better coverage .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's like antennas .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that's just like that's an attractive base station .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , what else ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and the basis station is going to have the input from the power line for charging the batteries .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is it really weight ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is it light or .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it is very light .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's about the weight of banana .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to give you the correct look and feel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as banana .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "otherwise it's child comes and so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "child would try to eat it anyway , so we should consider that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "health and safety aspects .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we didn't think of that yet .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so for the power source , you still you want to use both solar cells and batteries .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , where are going to where are you going to place them ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't really the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have recharging base station .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it'll be always at top somewhere at there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if was gonna place them i'd put them on the top here since that's like the black bit but don't really don't t's necessary to have the solar cells anymore .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have enough surface ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because now we are having rechargeable batteries so that is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what will be the autonomy ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what do you mean ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how long does how long can it be held off station ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how long the how long the bit the batteries long .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "eight to ten eight to ten hours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "long , so it's used only when you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , it can it should be weeks .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "most no most of the time it's not being used .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but people don't like to put it back in the base station all the time people leave wanna leave it on the couch so , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so when you are making it on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no eight or ten hours of working .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we are having the speakers regular chip for control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "pricing is was factor so that's why we have gone for regular chip only not the advanced chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that's it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "those really sounds very good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "nothing else to add ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it seems to be falling over .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the thing that convince me the less is the multifunctional buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "looks bit puzzled how to say that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you want to have more functional buttons ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you the buttons change their function depending if it's teletext or not and the volume button will become and what about people who want to use digits ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you are not convinced .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not many , we want to keep it simple .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that this button fo is for teletext which is usually also the case , that usually there is teletext button and once you press that , the channel buttons , they baco become the scrolling buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's up to you , means .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now that means let's say this can move the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "fact both will be could be useful , navigating through teletext .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or can move between positions in the number .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "butto real buttons ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so there was constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we are targeting segment which is just very trendy thing , they don't care about the buttons any more .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and anyway evalua .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because have you thought about configuration and all this ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's all automatic .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's all automatic .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "very good you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we are living in wonderful world .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we have to go through now evaluations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so your slides are ready ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is one , which one is this one ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "const constructed list of criteria based on the general user requirements .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and each criteria is will be evaluated it's logical criteria so we must users must say if it's true or is or if it's false in scale ranging from zero to seven .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "why this strange factor of seven ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "usually have seen that scales are from one to ten .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's from , it's from one to seven .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's from one to seven .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because it should be an even it should be an even scale , and five is too short and nine is too long .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "num number so to have in order to have enough granularity it's in order to have enough granularity in the evaluation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "fine , got the idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the variance is mi it's is minimal .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm answering your question .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that's the criteria found more useful .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "sh could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we all four could range could evaluate the let's evaluate if it's fancy or seven but would say seven .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you can say fancy , handy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's fancy , according to me .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "seven by me .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's quite fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you can add seven plus six plus seven plus five .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what do you say seven ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "five , six it's .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "six point five .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "again i'll give seven .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'd give it six like i'd it's probably more handy than my current remote , 'cause of the scroll wheels but loses the point for not having the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason but you can always use your other remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so seven , six point five .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "seven for me .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll give five .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would say everything ar everything it's compared to the all remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "depends when you say functional , do you mean it does what we want it to do , or does what it does , can it make you coffee ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for remote control , does he have all the you could expect .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what is available in the market off the shelf .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have to say four .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "actually what are the real specification of universal remote contro it's not an univer but it's for all t_v_s ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "t's not universal remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "remember we're focus we're supposed to focus just on t_v_s .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "all t_v_s but only t_ only t_v_s .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's universal but for t_v_s .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so four point two ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are some outliers so which i'll say five .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there i'll give it seven .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it means features , like new features actually .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for t_v_ the most important feature which felt was the locator which is feature .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then the scroll buttons are again features .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we don't have for it but that we decided we don't want to have .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would say five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "plus six , say said seven .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's six .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you said seven ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause it's five seven so , definitely easy to use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "outl you are not lik outlier .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have them of cour the most difficult question for the end .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright , now here's the sixty million dollar question , twenty five euro question .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll buy the banana .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what do you what do you reckon ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll say five .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "twenty five euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll say five .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "find it quite cheap actually .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it depends , if you live in switzerland or you live in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the target price is for all europe , or only for rich countries ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's more targeting u_k_ or so this is selling costs , not production costs .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wha the initial specifications were for the whole all europe or this is the initial specifications .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would say six .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's quite cheap actually .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'd say two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't want banana on my living room table , banana remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "aw , should be in your it's kitsch .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no but it's really handy actually if you see .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it is handy , it's handy , but it it's terrible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's so handy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then anyb anybody who comes here anybody who comes to your home he'll at least ask once what is this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it's not positive thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's very positive thing if you see like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", it's handy , it's ergonomic , but it's banana .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't forget , don't for don't forget who we're targeting also who are wh , youngst no if you would be young .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually change the question .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it says , would buy this , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not telling that you are young .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "li like teenager .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , it's .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you're crazy teenager and you like fun things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would buy still i'd say two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you want to flaunt .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you with your girlfriend .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you want to show the beautiful banana you have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or might be it does some other thing but , crazy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't at any stage in my life would want banana remote control , really .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you give know .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "say , there is market for it , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you say two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what's the new question ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you have saved it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so upload the it's two different situations .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you'll have to reload .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , it depends if had to spend twenty five euro , if that was like my limit , would buy it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you really need an universal remote control or if you would change your remote control for new one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's two different question .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because the other twenty five euro remote controls are probably gonna look worse than banana .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they're not going to be as and they might not be as easy as this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it this is gonna handy to use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "go slightly up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "stick to five .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "although it still has it still has the word at the beginning so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have six , five three so we are six , five , four .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'd give it i'd give it four now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "six , five , four .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "six , so it's five point five , or less .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so and last question , will change my rem change my remote control from mando banana .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no we can't .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually , we five ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no let's say i'll put two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'd say three , my remote control is kinda at home is pretty terrible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it was change my remote control of my d_v_d_ player for mando banana then would be more inclined to but 'cause it's really bad but i'd say three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's for the t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll still give it five .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "two three five two three fi and two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you are romantic , really .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would say two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's somewhere three point five .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's , three point five .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "who is the outlier ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "wh you said five ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no said five .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no you say five , he is the outlier .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just do sum .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if it's no because there are more , we shouldn't sum like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's not very promising but we're not young trendsetters .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we should have look globally glob .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because the last two questions is much more important than the rest actually .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "otherwise we wouldn't we will not sell .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is there some formula you're using that says you have to sum them up ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no didn't anything .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just leave it at that then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we can we should stick to general feeling .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can had have out of these numbers , which is that should go for it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you want me to sum it's not actually what's the differen too expensive .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "problem with connectors ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it you just lose information if you sum it , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so let's move on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now we have to estimate the cost .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so prepare an excel sh an excel sheet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are going to calculate the production costs .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we should be below twelve point five .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so already put some pu some numbers here , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we are going to go through so this is the number of components we need for this thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it appears that there were things that we didn't thought about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and also things that forget to put like solar cells .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "decided against the solar cells so you mean , charging it by shaking the banana .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "finally we say no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "solar cells , we said no to that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so let's go let go through all the lines .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so hand dynamo .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this something we didn't thought about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to bring the cost .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we stick to battery , one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no kinetic also .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't see the difference between kinetic and dynamo .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "dynamo is like you have to actually .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have to see so kinetic is really shaking the banana .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so those banana is falling .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's go ahead .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we st only have one for battery .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then for electronics so didn't put anything for the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we have the regular chip on the print , which is one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and that's it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no so we hin so one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we have sample speaker .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the cost of that is very high .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ye the cost is increasing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually that no that sample speaker is not we we're not using that , we're just using the very beep simple beep , that sample thing is like the voice recording and everything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we are the beep .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's what so i'll remove it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so don't we need there is no listing for radio frequency thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we have sev .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we we'll put some extras , if there is something .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we'll see later .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so in for the case put single curved .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to reduce the cost , it's .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "second , no , it's double curved , it's got , it's monotonic but it's got but if you hold it if you hold it that way that's two curved , one on this side , one on that side , but they're opposite sides .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because we have two things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's got all the directions so don't worry .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's got direction .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what if put one here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is actually this probably actually costs more than three if you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so let's put one here in the then instead of single oka all .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we stick to plastic , it cost nothing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no didn't we say we wanted to do rubber if you drop it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , it's too no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's too expensive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're already at eleven .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll come back we'll come back and see if we can fit it in .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so put rubber one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so special colour , yellow .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for the interface we have three .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we don't have any push buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , we have two push buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no that is scroll wheel itself , it'll be put in that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have two scroll , and we have three push buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually whe when you wrote regular chip you should put two , because there is another chip here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's gonna have to be plastic .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and no it's no chip .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is just radio frequency .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is no chip .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you need fo it does nothing actually ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there's no chip there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it just emits the signal .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the receiver accepts it and that's it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just se sends the signal , that's it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's recharger thing and actually did think about it myself but because you could potentially you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for instead of turbo button but the turbo button does add that extra class .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we didn't think thought about integrated scroll wheel push buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if we're over budget then we could rethink that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so no , so for we have no button supplements , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "fact could we could not we consider this button as button supplement because no , these are for colours , co and special forms , special colours and special materials .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no we're not we don't need anything special for the buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we are over budget .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so first thing which we should take care of is , instead of rubber , let it be plastic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "make it plastic instead of rubber .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then we're on budget except for ten cents .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that much money will be required for the base station , which is not there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so mayb we have to put two here because it cost nothing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "pl the base station is made out of many units of plastic .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so might be ninety centimes for the remaining things which the cord and everything which'll go .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "exactly so we have margin for that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does that include charging circuitry and everything ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what do we do with the extra profits ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we'll invest in and d_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the next fruit .", "speaker":

"speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would , would buy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no we have product which none of us would buy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because the evaluation project would buy , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which is different .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which is different .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "none of us will buy it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no it's people in milan and in paris that are gonna buy it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're not in milan or paris .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have been in milan couple of times , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "actually there were lot of that's 'cause i'm sick of milan .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is battery .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you said the lowest .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is what we which you can it did .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for the batteries .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "extra battery , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "exac fact did not didn't know really what to say here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so project process .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you have any ideas of what we can say .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so don't understand what they mean by satisfaction and for and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should it be more like status of the these meetings .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "fact we use little bit the white board and the digital pen , not that much .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we had fair bit of creativity .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's really creative .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and but one thing we missed out of this whole process was like focus group with the actual people we're targeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we needed some of these young trendsetters to come in and play with the banana and see if they see if they like it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should go through , an evaluation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because the evaluation for us is pointless .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you should we should do kinda evaluation in the streets like asking to young peoples , do you like to have banana as remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because it would also be interesting to you to know find out if we have market in really young children as , to see how to market this thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause if you don't wanna give all your kids their own remote because they'll be changing the channel all the time but in some households where there is t_v_ for each kid , then , banana remote control could be fun for them as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "might have to draw face on it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so but that's something we need to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "any new ideas we could investigate next time ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "dunno , oranges ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the cost of the thing can be made more than might be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because it's just the optimal , what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are ways we could simplify the just the circuit board that we're using inside , i'm not really how complicated our needs are .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "all we have is two push buttons and two scrollers , do we really need an integrated circuit to process that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so more general remote control instead of just focusing on t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the complexity shouldn't be much higher .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for you said if it good for d_v_d_ then would bye .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and also fo for mood lighting and , that would be rather .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's actually something that should be in version two , is the ability to control things other than the t_v_ and not just electronic equipment but the whole environment of the room .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what else ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can go home .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can hassle the production department to make real prototype that we can use at home to evaluate .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so very much .", "speaker": "A"}], "id": "xxxxx", "relations": [{"y": 1, "x": 0, "type": "Explanation"}]}]
