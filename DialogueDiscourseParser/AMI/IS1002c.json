we've got our conceptual design meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm old as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "hopefully we've all got exciting ideas now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "thirty's really young , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so here's our agenda .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm gonna open .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm gonna talk for bit about what we're gonna do .",

"speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll go first .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what's components design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "presented by name .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "my name is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "jose he man is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "your name is name ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my name is name .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my name is inigo montoya .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you killed my father .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "did this in bit of rush .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "prepare to die .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so here's look inside your really old-looking remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you've got printed circuit board here , and you've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber nubbies into these little holes that activate we've all broken remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we've all broke remote control ri .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i've love you tech , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you've also got you've got your chip here , your batteries here , and some sorta electronics .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you've got here's transistor , and this amplifies your signal , you've got the l_e_d_ here on the end of the on the end of the printed circuit board .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they just do jabber .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there's thingy and dingy and nah .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you press this and it does who and whatnot .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you've got couple diodes here for who and whatnot .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we've got in this drawing he in this example here , this is eighteen pin chip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's two double batteries .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is pretty standard remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so here are options for our power sources .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can use basic battery , which we've already discussed , our tech department also said we have the option of doing some hand dynamo where you crank it like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if that's really we got some qu crazy down there in that department so you shake it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wanna change that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "gotta flashlight , and but it's interesting 'cause you shake it like this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's the next bullet is the kinetic provision of energy , so it's like that flashlight where you have to shake it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that's on the camera .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we've got solar cells , which don't very good idea because you could not use your remote at night which doesn't make lot of sense .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and finally we've got our cradle our power cradle idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we have battery versus cradle here ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "battery versus cradle is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like the kinetic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we have battery versus cradle it's actually novel thing because you could sell it as novelty , just to be actually serious for minute here , you could .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "figured you would .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it could be fun .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it is more it is more eco-friendly than the cradle 'cause you're still using power off the grid with the cradle .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so our case design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "our material choices are plastic latex ty or plastic , rubber latex type thing , wood , or titanium .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we go with titanium we're gonna be limited in the amount of shapes we can do because it's tough to shape the titanium , and pers wood 't see anybody wanting to use wooden remote , it's just anti-technology really , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wood would ge would give us little bit of marketing niche , wouldn't it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to me in marketing sense it's not relative .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can accentuate whatever product you put in there we can find way to accentuate it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and what we may be able to do , and this might be the best option is to combine some couple of these .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my recommendation personally would be to do some plastic inner shell with like rubber outer shell , to make it to mak like thick plastic inner shell and to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable , and also it feels little better than the plastic .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you get good grip on the rubber ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if you make it from that super rubber , when you drop it on the floor it can bounce back up in your hand .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you don't even need to lean down to get it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the advantages of working with plastic and rubber is we we'll have lot more options just in terms of shape because you can extrude plastic in any shape you want .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so and then we can cover the breakable bits with rubber so but these are curved and double-curved believe that the tech department , in their message to me , that they were referring to the number of curves in the bottom .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have no idea exactly what they're talking about , but that's what they told me , uncurved , flat , curved , or double-curved .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would this like this pen would be kinda like double-curved , where it's curved on multiple axes , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "curved means just curved in one axis and double-curved is curved in two axes or surfaces .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have no idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it might mean something like that sorta shape because double curve rather than that's what .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's what see .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like wave , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's what see also .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright that makes sense .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "with the interface we have the following options , we can use push buttons , we can use scroll wheel with an integrated push button , and display , or multiple scrolling wheels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so these are all options that the user interface guy can has at his disposal to put together user interface .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for electronics , we have these very technical descriptions here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "simple chip , which is the least expensive , but have no numbers to give you , regular chip , which is like the medium porridge the medium expense yes the difference is , with simple chip will operate why doesn't this scroll up ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between simple chip and an advanced chip ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "simple chip is required to operate push buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "an advanced chip is required to operate the display , and it didn't say specifically , but have hunch that regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that makes sense .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's the end of my presentation .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so presentation from design would go best .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "technical functions or interface concept ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "very long presentation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , but it has your name on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that doesn't bo bode for it tats as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , somehow that thing's too big , but our manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they say they could put it to work but we don't .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it you'll be affected by the other speech and fighting for the remote would not be fun anymore , and that's one of the things we wanna keep .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if the t_v_ is working , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's just it'll if somebody says up in the middle of television show , it's gonna change the channel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so then why don't you just press the up button ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but what if you actually had to press button to make it recognize ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if you pressed it and went , up ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that kinda would .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that would lose it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if it's just one thing with button that you can just go up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "even still there's gonna be interf there's there still will be interference from the t_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it might not be it might not be completely confusing , but you'll still it's still don't t's practical .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's bad idea frankly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so taking that away , our the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable it's the ones that would al would allow us to market our product as being less prone to damage and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it or mistreat misuses as it happens to remote controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you know your .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as for the point that we making about losing it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we wanna small remote control one side because we want it to be and designed , but market shows that bigger remotes get less lost , about but we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that would believe .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the what would propose is something more or less in the direction of what is to yo the of that slide but without with less complicated design , so the numbers , the volume control , and channel control , and teletext access .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the volume and channel control can just become those the four button array as in if it was round dial .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if you just think about it as the one to the but with the numbers and the four buttons plus centre one with teletext .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we're suggesting doing sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ye no it's not it's just four buttons that are on cross , so that you ba can control all of the important tasks from that alone .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's not scroll wheel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "instead of play , stop , rewind , and fast forward there , that's up , down , louder , and quieter .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we go mid-sized , so something looks good and is not too prone to get lost .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that be it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so on to functional requirements or trend watching ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "trend watching has later date there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "trend watching believe .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "forty six nineteen fifty seven .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see what it looks like .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's been so long .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what to say .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "when see the when see the product don't wanna buy it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "see so many of out there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are you talking about the picture ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's not our that's not our design , that's just something he graphic he used to show you the layout of what the layout of the buttons might be like .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause now don't have too much to say about how to market this product because we don't have product to market yet .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and from talking to mike is that we have we can market more expensive product now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's what understand so , hello .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "upper management said yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "excuse that , that's bit of spam .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so i'm little bit stuck now in that what is it that i'm gonna market ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "without special or increased marketable features don't believe the product has consumer demand .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like the idea of the scroll makin there are so many people making these products at this price now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what are we gonna do to make this one special and unique ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what's special and unique about scroll ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't it's see it as different .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't say it's specially don't say it's special .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "say that it's different what i'm looking for as marketing is give me something different .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "give me lower price , give me higher price , give me some new technology , don't give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it's at the same price .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "need something to market about this thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're new firm .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'd say though that we if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though , the then we have that as , but wi with similar .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what if when we have when we have something like the cradle or give that's as marketing standard need something to market , to make this product unique .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the two big points that we have so far are the having the cradle and also having the actual design of the case itself having like this like rubber shell with plastic interior , having it look really and also be really durable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just remember when made up this report didn't have the information that we're discussing here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so when we have cradle , when we have some design , so what i'm saying is , from my perspective , don't have product to market now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost , either lower or develop an integrated new technol technology .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's that is the next step , there's technology and then there is technology , which we're moving into the next phase .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so we're gonna have some new technology to enhance the marketability .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "again i'm not sold on the product because we don't have product in my opinion yet .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so need product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's get product then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "need product to market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and whatever product you put together , we'll find way to market it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "tha that i'm not concerned with .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so now so our big questions here really are cradle or not cradle ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you give me if you give me cut-out of what everybody else has then need to find lower cost .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do we go basic or do we go for features ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off-hand first ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my question is what would the scroll wheel do ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "function-wise , what does that do that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that was in your presentation so wh what would you imagine it doing ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wh what's the wh now what see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "t's it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but would we .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so from marketing standpoint have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it creates something more complex or more expensive , then if that makes it marketing necessity .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but again , from marketing perspective want as much new and different about this thing as possible because we're co it's very competitive market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what understand about scroll wheels is they're quite expensive to make .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they are gonna be more expensive , but on the other hand , it is an alternative if you think that's gonna sell some if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales it's worth it to do it , but would just use if was gonna do this would just use the scroll wheel for channels up and channels down .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so like the idea of focusing the my personal preference is focusing the product on the idea of the case the dock to put it in to charge it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't think volume or do you think volume would be no we can do multiple scroll wheels but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll bet first in volume .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can target like environmentally friendly ideas , that sorta things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it makes it easy to market , it's easy to differentiate the product , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if we keep the rest in format that is durable because the whole product's gonna need to be more durable thus because you're not going to be ditching it as often .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if we can market it in terms of that and so our big decision then is like how do we do like we have to decide on the details and we have to decide on not exactly the details , but do we have what type of casing ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we got some exclusivity in that , we got something that nobody else has now , and that means we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to and it also can create it's own demand from it's uniqueness .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm thinking something like kinda almost like these pens , where there's you have plastic bits and then it's not really rubber but just kinda like fused the plastic with rubber on the outside .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just very thin sorta sheet for grip , sorta thing or for .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no ma bit more then is on here but ju just as an inspiration , these pens are or from my perspective is mistake because this is universal remote and all you're doing it's you're not gonna get any information back from the television , so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last and there's just not lot of information , there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so then if we do we want to do anything more basic with the more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for buttons , or do we want if we're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do we want to give do we want to have anything else on it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's only t_v_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it receives no information .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so don't see any reason for having an 'cause it's an increased cost .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "unless you can think of something interesting to do with it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now there's nothing coming out of the t_v_ to receive , so unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the cable box there's no don't see the , don't see the necessity of an either .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't see it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the question is now we need to decide on you have to now go and figure out the details of this thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , what we need to terms of marketing and project management are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you can go and build this ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what overall things have we not decided on ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have to for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gonna be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's the scroll wheel , in or out ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what do you like in the user interface ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in terms of marketing , is that gonna make enough of difference to justify the cost ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's the more uniqueness you can bring to the product , the easier it is , believe , for me to market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "again the push-buttons see are everywhere .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so we can go with the same thing , but we're gonna be com competing in broader market than if we go with something unique .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the other thing about was , do we go to something like this ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "make remote that doesn't look like remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's just another it's just an idea , and what see one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is , when you got children , their gets inside the circuitry , they get dirty , they get messy with drinks and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "dunno about like the flip-phone idea , because , as far as durability it's not big when it's closed .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this and what keep throwing out there keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you are the ones that have to ultimately create the product within cost .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the question that you're being asked now is whether is the dock enough of unique feature to be able to go out and sell that as very different product , or do we really need the scroll wheel as ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because the scroll wheel comes at quite cost .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you gotta get into cost effectiveness .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you can have the base station with locator , those are two very strong features , if that's something that can be integrated without bunch of extra cost .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the locator's gonna require radio transmitter , which will we're probably gonna have to go with like medium chip , would imagine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's gonna is that gonna need better chip as ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no it's just different .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we will need receiver , an antenna .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's just that's know personally that would be very attractive feature , is to have button push to find my remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it should be really simple signal though so that's true .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it's presumably gonna need little speaker in it like that as to beep .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but little tiny speaker is gonna be quite cheap , it's not gonna need quality , is it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's makes your living room more fresh as you watch .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it'll be really cheap .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or you can like have smell-o-rama , you push button and it puts out stink .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're doing for time here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've got about another ten minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that pr my personal preference is out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the scroll wheel , in or out ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't think the cost is justified for little bit more uniqueness when we already have that , and don't t's obvious and natural how it would be used .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have like and it's not very usable and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing , 'cause it's it breaks down easier .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for me the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "exactly what the increased cost is gonna be , but he does have point , it might push somebody over the edge when they're looking at our remote versus something else , when they see this one has scroll wheel to go up and down on the channels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it might be kinda neat to be able to do it like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but then that surely depends little on the t_v_ because some t_v_s are quite slow at changing channels from like so if you've got scroll wheel and you have to scroll it really slowly just so that you're actually keeping in pace with the t_v_'s ability to change channels .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or do you have to go through and you for it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you scroll it bunch of times and you for it to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wh what it would be is like the like this , where it's digital wheel , where it's quantized into certain that was my intuition of what the scroll wheel would be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's where you see what you're talking about now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's just it's it it's just look and feel thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it has the same exact functionality as two buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's that there are so many people today that are surfing are television surfers , and see the scroll as mechanism for surfing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "instead of going button-to-bu you just you'd .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you're just sitting there going that's kinda actually .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "really think that's really thing for surfing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now just so though you did bring up point which is very valid , is lot of t_v_s won't re the t_v_s won't respond exactly the same .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "some of them are gonna be kinda slow switching , so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes , and it'll be like flip , flip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you could make it so that it'll it's just gonna be sending signal to the t_v_ the t_v_'s ge so if you send about five flip channels , if you did that it's gonna flip once .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you do that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it just might be frustrating where you can't make it go as fast as you want , but once people get used to it do like the idea of the scroll wheel though .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "other than click .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if we're marketing it as high niche product , then we're gonna be selling it to people who are buying good t_v_s as , presumably .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now the only thing on the interface side of it , is that see the dilemma .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but if we have the option of scrolling at any particular speed , or the option of jumping direct , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so go presuming have , on my television , something that tells me what channel i'm on , scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because it's on the television .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the television tells me what channel it's on when change it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that really that's gonna be problem , 'cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so ca can we create that interface within scroll system ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you understand what i'm saying ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you might be getting at , or , what about this what about if you can programme in your favourite channels into this scroll wheel and you can just like roll through your favourite channels , and it why ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "see so if we had an up the top that just did number on it , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no we could read it from the television .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then it that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you'd need display on the thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it'll tell you when you flip the channel on the t_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the television can tell you .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no see what you're talking about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how would you program it though ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you just it's one extra button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you say programme start , and then type in 'cause you still have the typing you'll still have the keypad where you can type in manually .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "put and then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so programme start , zero , one , enter , zero , five , enter , thirty eight , enter ,

have another marketing tool .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have about three we have three or four things here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's not gonna be too expensive because that's gonna be you're gonna be able to nab that off of computer mouse manufacturers really .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you could come up with partnership to be able to produce that quite cheaply .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and an we even have this as in-house technology .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this may be something that's available through our own through our own services .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "might be , but tha that's not gonna be such costly feature .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the problem we're gonna have is making it robust .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes , between going through your favourites list and just hitting up one , up two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "making it last .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or we go directional up we go this we go this we go this way for one , we go this way for the other .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if there's button for each type .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no because you wanna be able to go up and down through the channels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "people are gonna have their favourite sorta , whether they do that or whether they the mode switch .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", then you just have , you have diff you have mode switch .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we'll need mode switch , but then if we have mode switch we're gonna need some kinda indicator to which , an l_e_ an l_e_d_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just the lights behind the buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you could have back-lit buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would that work ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that we have five minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so details that we've talked about here are that we want scroll wheel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we want mode indicator .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we want back-lit buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if we're making back-lit buttons period , do we want that

that we have more money , we can push up the price .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "didn't you say so ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can increase the cost .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so whether having the design and technology has to come back and say , to create this product we see it's gonna cost us this much for this volume , because we do have volume target of fifty million profit .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "wanna make everybody's on board with it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we really need to be as to what we can push the cost up to , though we haven't got to stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but i'd say what sorta price are we looking to be able to sell something like that , and what sorta price can we make it for ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no that's where we really should be more flexible than anything else because as we said in the last meeting , our management is really looking for us to push our brand .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're entering new market here , so the profit expectation for this one product is not as important as being able to but what's our ballpark as to what we'd be able to sell something like this for ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm with that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what want to me the next step is for these to come in with the design proposal with the cost estimate attached , and then we have to take this to the next level .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's try and think now , how much would you pay for with all these features how much would you pay if you went to the store , and you were in the market to replace your t_v_ remote , how much would you pay for that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have to find cost .", "speaker": "D"},

other hand would think , with my project manager salary , would could probably afford this would buy it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if then you could probably afford this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if had new t_v_ and this was looking really slick and it had the dock and it had the scroll wheel , which 's really idea , that would sell me on it little .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do don't 'd go over hundred euro certainly , that would be way too much , but the would be happy paying over forty for it , but not much .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would say thirty five to forty .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was gonna say thirty five to fifty .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "thirty five to fifty euros is our sales bracket .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the question is what we ca we make it for .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because one of the things we're marketing about this product is that this is the last one you will ever need to buy for your television .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's one of the marketing features in this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's why the scroll needs to be really robust .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we'll come up with something
