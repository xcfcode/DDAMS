drive the project and , from the account manager .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "did you send us an email about this ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not yet , but if you want do you want do you want me to send you mail ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we received an email about this designs .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or you can put it in the shared folder .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you see the email ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the very no , no the first one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , didn't get it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the third one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you didn't get anything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "got an email about the dis about the discussion .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you get email , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "from the account manager .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have received the same email , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's for your to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so each of us has role to do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "assign your roles .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for each one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in each we already have our role .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for each person , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can so there are three kinds of designs , that's all .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so there are so we have three .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have functional design , conceptual design , and detail design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , who will be the responsible for the functional design ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , i'm doing the interface .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm doing the interface .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you are doing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are you using the you are doing the in .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm , we have so industrial design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it was little confusion about my but it's alright .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll for industrial design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you norman ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and doing the marketing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm into marketing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "nothing much in the project .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "nothing related here to the next .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "marketing in this design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "design is for industrial design and the user interface .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you see the second mail ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "see there's role for everybody .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "even for the marketing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "us user define .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but look at your role , your marketing role .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's trend watching .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's your role .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can have little discussion about what has to be done and what are your ideas about the , we want to have new re remote control for t_v_ distribution .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "about the design or we'll discuss this later , no ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we have to plan how it would be developed and how we can make it work .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "working remotes we already have .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this will be something different from the other remotes remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what we have to keep in mind the these characteristics .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it should not be very costly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so about the about what ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that norman and would think about the technical points and we should discuss it in the next meeting , or .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "need to collect information .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm part of design , perhaps .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what is most important in remote control ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what is the most important function aspect ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you mean the external or of .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have to make it work .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's the big thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it should be easy to work with .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can think about an interface with , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we you can have speech recognition interface .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you just tell the television want which channel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or you can say , want to list all the programme tonight .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you won't if we include lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "instead of remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just say want to press wanna have button for all the movies tonight .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or button for all the magazines , all the information documentary tonight .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then you list few , and will choose from the list .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so instead of pressing the channel number , am choosing the programmes directly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's one way of making it useful .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , because no , it's not very lot .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like you say we can use speech .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this information exists .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can get you can use anything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the idea of using speech to reduce the button , but and it's more natural .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you want to choose from list of programme or like that you may have to use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the main function of remote control is to have something in the hand and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in the hand .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we are going to add speech interface , i'm not with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put speech recog if you want to put speech recognition system interface for that the t_v_ itself could have it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , possible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and could talk to the t_v_ television itself .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "except if you are far from the t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "need not have an we have some , different technology but , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is it's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the main idea wanted to say is that there should be function , instead of choosing the ch t_v_ channel , there's option you can choose , either t_v_ channels or pr or the contain or the contents of the programme .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "on the content .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's good idea it's good idea but that technically it would be little bit more tricky to achieve this than just to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's more powerful .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , because you see now all the t_v_ programmes are available on the webs .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they are available in x_m_l_ format or whatever the format .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we don't care .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we just say that this are some content .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we just want to retrieve the content and then classi sort them by the types of programmes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "some of the websites they already provide this service , so we can just use the service available .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "download it to the to this remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the most there are only seven buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so choose the category one and you reuse the same button , to choose among the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we should also optimise the number of buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to navigate through the channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so in the dis display on the t_v_ screen and just with the with your remote control would just navigate through the , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you don't have to display here , just display on the t_v_ screen , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that will be revol revolutionary .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because all the t_v_ the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so for the technical points we have to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this so , norman , draw .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we have five minutes to you can use it if you so , can we you it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have sometimes to use the white-board .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of so , if you're watching movie and suddenly there is dark some dark scene , the lights adapt themself .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the lighting in the room changes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we are designing just remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have option in the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we want to have that option , you press that button in the remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you want to have conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you can if you want you can use the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "go on , draw something .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm afraid you forgot to put your lapel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "where is it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or before the design that says .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "where is it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just plug it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "be before writing you can sit and that says what we said then after that you can use the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the most functional des the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we agree on that , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "first one is to buttons or it could be anything with buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to choose content or channels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we have both .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the user can choose which one they want , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "by content or by channel , it's good idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "by content or by channel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "choose by contents or by channels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so and then what did we say just now ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "other than this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we have to find way how to gather information about the contents .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's not very difficult to browse by channel but it's little bit tricky to browse by contents so that's the things to do and to reflect about it and discuss it in the next meeting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so these we have to work it out .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this one of the problem .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the main thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get the funct this is the functional designer ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the first aspect .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we will get information and then we'll come back in .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we'll meet in five minutes ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we'll discuss the other aspects .", "speaker": "A"}], "id": "xxxxx", "relations": [{"y": 1, "x": 0, "type": "Explanation"}]}]
