[{"edus": [{"text": "how we doing ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this product at the within the budget that was given .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's also an item that people lose lot .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we should address that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , it should be something that is very simple to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in addition to that to make it sell , the marketing manager wishes that it be very attractive , or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that's very important fact , 'cause if they say , go home and think about it , that won't work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also mentioned was it should be it should have very short learning curve .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it could be sold by using slogan .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have chip that has infra-red bits and it has an interface controls interface that controls the chip .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "therefore , messages will be controlled in the same manner .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there should be extra features like lid buttons , beep .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if too many buttons are pressed , child lock and display clock so that people could you could see the time , what show they want to watch .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also mentioned was different shapes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the components of the thing should be button , bulbs , infra infra-red bulbs , battery , chips , wires , and some holder for the item .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "francino who is our interface designer has mentioned that the that it , should have an on-off button , and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have channel lock .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "particularly with small children that they couldn't watch channel that is undesirable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it should be compact .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "her personal favourite was it should be t-shaped .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and have an anar alarm-clock .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the material should possibly be not of non-allergic nature .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the different systems that exist are infra-red or radio-waves .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it should have electri electrici electricity saving feature .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and even possibly timer to so that people can program their favourite program on from the remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that is it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then we i'm looking for three presentations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and whether the order matters much , don't , so whoever wants , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now my slide , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "come on , close already .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's number two , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now as an interface designer , would give more emphasis on the interface , how the remote looks like so that it is sellable , it is attractive to customers .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now the function of remote is to send messages to the television .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this messages could be switch on-off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto particular channel , like you can have the numbers one , two , three , four , up to nine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "nine channel switches ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "nine channel switches ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , nine numbers .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then you have swapping of button by which using which you can swap the channels if you don't want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then it should have next button , and next button channel by which you can keep on scrolling the channels one by one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "going to the nex next .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "next slide , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then you should have button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then , there should be button which can give subtitles for particular program which is going on television .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you are watching french program and you would like to have subtitles in english , then there should be channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see the subtitles on the screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour , colour of the picture , the contrast , sharpness , brightness of the picture .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now there should be memory switch .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there should be mute button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "suddenly if viewer he gets telephone call , and if he want he doesn't want to switch off the t_v_ , but he can reduce the sound , he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can while talking he can watch the t_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now the most important feature would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so remote can be designed which can have the voice recognisers , you can record your own voice which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television , if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel , now the , the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the t_v_ will have some recogniser which will recognise the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is one of the very important feature remote control can have .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is one of the interface which can be created .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "very simple interface which has all the important features .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then , next slide .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then , these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour , but they have many buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can design an interface which is very simple , and which is user-friendly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "even kid can use that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so can you go on to the next slide .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and this has multi-purpose use , it can be used for t_v_ , it can be used for cable-satellite , it can be used for v_c_r_ , d_v_d_s and audio .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and this has in-built voice recogniser .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can you go on to the next slide ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now this is an interface for chil for remote which child can use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is user-friendly , it's very attractive and children can use it as they can play with it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and this comes with different colours , different shapes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and this child interface has minimum buttons and all the important buttons are there in this small , compact , attractive child interface .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "next slide , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now this is big over-sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "could lose that in minute .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this is no this is very big , you cannot misplace it anywhere .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is jumbo universal remote control and it's impossible to im misplace or lose .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is one such interface which can be created .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the personal preference would be spe to incorporate speech recognisers which will respond to user's voice for particular function .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "any comments on her presentation ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "looks like we still have quite choice of things out there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what i'm no suggestion's bad .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we're gonna have to narrow it down little more .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't think that we can get the t-shape is good , the child one is good , the too big to misplace , it's just funny .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't think that's gonna be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , the these are her presentations , but as far as the decision making we getting to that after but if wanted to know whether anybody had any anything to add to her presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's gonna be little bit too unwieldy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have to come back to that later .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , her presentation was good , and she really explored all the options .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ho who wants to go next ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the next one , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's it was the old one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the components design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this time i'm going to concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can you go on to the next slide , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have just brief down few components which we require for the remote control construction .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit , battery , etcetera , it's like it can be plastic one , hard plastic , so that it can be strong , even if you just , if you if it falls down , then it doesn't break .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it should be strong .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and there are no harmful materials used in that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it should be recyclable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , and also using of colouring compon components like if we want to have different colours , blue , red , green , so we have to use some colouring compone components .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the second important thing is integrated circuit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "which we can use highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be like the lef ess less efficient so it you should we should have highly sophisticated one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it should be resistant to high as low temperatures .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "suppose if it is thirty-eight degrees outside forty degrees outside , it should be able to re resist the temperature highs and high temperatures and low temperatures .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it should be with equipped with timer and alarm facility .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the other component we should we have in the remote controller is resistor which is like it is very much important for the electricity flow through the remote controller and also capacitor which is it's like battery , capacitor .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can you go on to the next slide , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "diode , transistor , resonator , these are all this technical electri electronic compons components which are which we have to use in remote controller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "battery , would like to suggest one thing if we will be able to make res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for high performance battery , even if it is low performance battery it ca it can't charge much .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it it's not high voltage battery .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then also we can if it is rechargeable one , then people can use it for long time , so in that way we can cut the cost , but that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we have circuit board in remote controller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can you go to the next slide , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and how it works , how the remote controller works .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when you press button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when you press button , when you do that , you complete specific connection that means when you press button there will be small circuit underneath the button , and it will send some signals through the wires , and then the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "suppose you have pressed channel one button , number one you have pressed , then the chip will know that the number one button was pressed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it pros produces mors morse code line signal specific to that button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "every button , every individual button , has its own morse code .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "suppose the user has pressed butto button one , then it will have spe the circuit will generate specific morse code to that button , and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the l_e_d_ which translates the signal into infrared light .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like you have got signal by pressing button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now , that signal , that morse code , has to be amplified by the transistor .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that is the use of transist transistor we which we use in the remote controller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it will amplify the signal and it will send it to the l_e_d_ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the sensor on the t_v_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately , that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal , then it will know which what action it has to do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then it will do the appropriate action .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is how the remote controller works .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can you go to the next slide , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have few pictures .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when you look at the remote controller it's it this is normal remote controller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and to the next slide , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and where we had few buttons and all .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components , like you can see chip there which is having eighteen pins , and also capac capacitor , three resistors and also resonator , and di and diode transistor .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the electronic components all of the electronic components have all those things like chip and diode transistors an , di can you can see the t_a_ double one eight three five labelled chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can also see the green two green things are these are they are resistors , and just beside that you can see transistor , and cylinder shape , that one is capacitor .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also there are resistors , ther there is diode .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can you go on to the next slide .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is the circuit board .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the green one is circuit board .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "actually , building circuit bo board is pretty easy and also it's inexpensive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's it costs less than what you print on paper , because when you are building some circuits and also wires , it's better to go for printing , because you can build these circuit boards on bulk and it's just printing , nothing like , you don't need to use wires and all .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's not exactly wires we are using .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's just printing something on board .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci circuits .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that green thing is circuit board , and also you can see there are like access for buttons , like when you press button , the circuit under the button will be activated it will he get some signals from it and it will ch its ch se send signal signals to the , integrated circuit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can you go to the next slide , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is these are the circuits un underneath the buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can you see the black , round marks ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they are the circuits .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and like we have designed before we have seen some few things like instead off buttons we have some scrolls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but push-button requires simple chip underneath it , but whereas scroll wheel requires normally regular chip which is higher price range .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like for scrolls we have to go for sophisticated and full complete chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and as energy source we offer basic battery , more ingenious hard dynamo , kinetic provision of energy , more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that also we can have in battery , or we can use solar sells .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the product can be de delivered into different cases .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "usually , the cases and card flat that we see usually normal remote controller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you have more pictures .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have five minutes to the end of the meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have just one more slide , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like we can have ma material such as plastic , rubber , wood , titanium , but titanium we can't use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also for electronics we can use simple and regular re or an advanced chip on the print , also infra it includes the infrared se sender .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the for the movie just to develop samples and so spe sample speaker .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "an , that's it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's all for me now , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "any particular comments by anybody ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "on the scroll and the push-button , ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing button ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , the scrolling wheels are different , like you can go for sw switches like buttons or scrolls , which we used to do before ten years before , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now , nobody uses that because you need sophisticated chip and all .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's better we go for ordinary buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we'll just go for push buttons for in the interest of cost .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we don't have lot of time left and we will still have to make decision , and the marketing expert has to present her thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "go to my first my next slide .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright , my method is i'm interested in what the competition is doing , and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition , so i've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "spend lot of time on the internet surfing around doing the same thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then when i'm out in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that , try to notice what remote controls people have , and if it's convenient in the conversation ask about it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and would encourage you all to do the same .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and my findings from this is that , small is beautiful .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "people like something that really fits in their hand .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "simple is beautiful .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they don't want to have to squint at small print , they want buttons whose functions are obvious , and they want as few buttons as possible , and they don't care for the mode thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they want each button to do something .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and eye-catching is important .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's gotta look cute , it's gotta look appealing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "go ahead , i'm trying to finish fast for you .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and our preference is , as far as i'm concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ours has to be look really and it has to come out before the others , so that we have leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their christmas item .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we try to tell people it has too many features , the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we've gotta narrow our selection down to li two things , that we gonna say are really about our new product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and i've been looking around at what designs every year different things are popular .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and in my research this year found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with little cloth on them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so those are things we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that concludes the presentation of everyone .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and what we really have to decide in this meeting is the concept of the remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so what do we think on the concept of the remote ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you wanna try to come back to yours , and limit yours bit ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this could be one feature which could be sellable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that could be our star feature .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that be really good , agree with that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but what i'm very much doubtful how far it will work , because speech recogniser like it has its own problems , issues .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's not distance problem it it's recognising person's voice , like different people will be having different voices , so it like it's everything so to get good recogni recognising system , it's costly thing , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you teach you have to teach , before we get too far off here , the components of the concept is the energy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , it's , it it's like your recording of all question already , and then you're expecting an answer from , you have t_v_ system , i'm the user and my family members are the user , will already record question like , good morning , like around eight o'clock want to see the news in the television .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so i'll say just good morning and the t_v_ will switch on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it will recognise my voice and will switch on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what energy do we foresee ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "battery , and we all on that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that that's gonna be most cost-effective and the best thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then chip on print .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the case .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we all agree on the case , we wanna have something bright , colourful .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "bright , colourful , trendy design , and strong .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and also strong .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "trendy design and compact .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "trendy design , compact and strong .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "user interface concept , interface type , supplements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that will be your area , jana .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like the switches , like we use buttons for user interface .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and not what they mean by supplements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and supplements like different types of features buttons , like can have mute button or swapping button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that , or like her speech recognition would also be supplement .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "her speech recognition feature would be supplement .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "our next meeting will be in thirty minutes , and the i_d_ is to this is the individual actions to be taken until then , to have the look and feel design , and the u_i_d_ is supposed to come up with the user interface design , and the marketing expert with the product evaluation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in this phase , the two of you , jana and francine , have to work together on prototype using modelling clay , it says here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you have any questions , you can always contact me or your coach , suppose .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wherever they're hiding ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we conclude the meeting here and we come back in thirty minutes , according to our timetable here .", "speaker": "A"}], "id": "xxxxx", "relations": [{"y": 1, "x": 0, "type": "Explanation"}]}]
