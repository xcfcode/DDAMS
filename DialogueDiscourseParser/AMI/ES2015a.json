"i'll be doing some trend-watching in the conceptual design , and product evaluation for the design phase .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright i'm heather and i've said i'm your project manager , you can read what it is that i'm doing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and tool training is one thing that we're going to be doing today , as planning the project , how we're going to , create this product , and , discuss , our aims and objects of this , which brings us to our next subject , is , as team we're going to be designing and creating new remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we want this to be marketable product that can be trendy , completely new style , so that , can really appeal to , to generation that doesn't want simple plain , channel-changer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , it needs to be user-friendly for , for an example , for people that , can't see the numbers as , or , perhaps an ergonomic design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is television

alright .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the way that we're going to go about this is , we'll have time where we can , come up with new ideas alone , and work on the project and then , after we've brainstormed and , and thought about , we can come together in meeting and , and discuss what , what functional design we want to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "same with conceptual design and detailed design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , making that it , it's usable , that as , and that it's , it's feasible to create , and , to come up with concept of it want , what we want it to look like .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is , is everyone , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "got those notes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one thing that , we're going to do is become more acquainted

"speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is my .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's sketching of my elk , and it , it is my favourite animal now , 'cause it is large beautiful majestic creature , that in way it looks awkward , because it's on spindly legs and it but it can really overcome harsh terrain , and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous , because it has strong antlers , and it can really combat its enemies , even like it it's an herbivore but , it can really defend itself .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm gonna take minutes while , you express your favourite animals .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll go next .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "am big animal lover .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like all sorts of animals , but for the moment i'm gonna draw cat , in memory

"speaker": "B"}, {"text": "bit more cartoon style .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but like cats because they're so independent , and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable , 'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as , and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and , running

"speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can pretend .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how do you draw dog ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "suppose it has lon my .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yous it's supposed to be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like dogs because , they're so good to humans , like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing-eye dogs , and they're just such friendly animals .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , like they're more of companion than cats .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've nothing against cats .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "cats don't really like me , so 't like them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but they're just so friendly and warm and animals , that don't look like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "feel like robot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "had the most time to think about it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm going to draw butterfly , because saw butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of spring arriving .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it was actually the prettiest butterfly i've ever seen out in the wild , and though that was pretty in scotland .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it was like , was little pointier than that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "at first it was dead leaf .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then it landed on the wall next to me .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then it kinda there was green , it was green ring , and there was like red going out like this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's kinda like peacock .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it kinda was actually , 'cause it was this part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , and i'm like , this is the middle of scotland in like march .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that was pretty .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it landed by wall and let me look at it for about two minutes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "wish i'd had my camera .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like spring is finally here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what do we .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , now that we know how to use the whiteboard , the next , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our budget , or not meet our budget but more , like what , selling range we'll be looking at , wanna make this selling price of twenty five euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so we have to , come up with way to , to create , remote control , where we can like the price to create it will be significantly less .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'd like to , make fifty million euro .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm assuming that's what the m_ means .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and make it for an international market .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of , like different kinds of , v_c_r_s .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "things like that , depending on which country you are .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "another thing for the design team to think about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we want it to cost , absolute maximum of twelve euro and fifty cents .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we'll have hundred percent profit then ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm bad at math .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so now that , that is underway , it is discussion time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any suggestions that you may have so far , your personal experiences with remote controls , and , areas you see that , could be improved in your experience with them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does anyone have any initial thoughts ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "find that in the dark it's often hard to button you're pushing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what's something we could , do to remedy that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's always , where is the remote control ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if you could have some tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can press button on your wall , signal , 'cause it always gets lost .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do yous not find that , like , there's lot of , buttons on your remote control , and you what half of them do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that you don't use half of them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what they do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's some remote controls where there's hidden panel , so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's , it is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you just have like the number buttons , power button , t_v_ video button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "anything about , the look of the , remote control that you might have ideas about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it could be , instead of like standard rectangular shape , it could be , something more interesting like any ideas will do that you have at this point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "could be shaped like conch , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "be like shell-shaped remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can hold it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are we going into novelty factors here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like , i've seen phones like .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's trendy original , aspect we're going for .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you're the designers , you can decide what , direction you wanna go in , but at this point in the , in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "suppose , if we're he heading to have it , like make huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite universally accepted thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like , novelty thing might only sell few things rather than , like , general more acceptable but we don't wanna go towards boring , 'cause that wouldn't sell either .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the key issue here is , is being trendy and original .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have five minutes left .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , just to cover we have one more thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like you can go over your ideas , in your own personal times .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our next meeting will be in half an hour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you have half an hour to , think about what you want to present .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or not present but bring to the meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i_d_ , whatever that stands for .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have to remember these things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you'll be beginning your , your working design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "u_i_d_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how this can be achieved , and , we need the user requirements from the manag marketing expert .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you will get specific instructions , of what to do in the next half an hour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and i'll see you in half an hour , ?", "speaker": "A"}], "id": "xxxxx", "relations": [{"y": 1, "x": 0, "type": "Explanation"}]}]
