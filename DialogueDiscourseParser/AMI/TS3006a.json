"C"}, {"text": "and let's see had to focus on the working design , which you said .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how does the apparatus work ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and had two points .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "according to the coffee machine example , have batteries to supply energy , and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the t_v_ .",

.", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that are the basic options for remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "kept it global 'cause that it activates or deactivates specific functions , 'cause wasn't thinking yet about that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you wanna ch flip the channel but you might wanna use teletext also .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what the word is in english .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and what did the marketing expert do ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "from marketing perspective , the function des design phase consists out of the user requirements .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so there are few means to reach that by doing research to see what existing products are there out in the market .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what functions do they have .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "especially what are their shortcomings ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are there any new functions which can be added to our product ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "therefore we have to do some internet search .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for what applications do current remote controls support , and what are featur features of current and future televisions ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text":

control ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "especially for future users , i'm thinking of early adopters , because they use new technology first , and they play with lot of tools and so they have some good ideas to add .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and you can get that information ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "get that information , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that would be very handy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but have you any idea so far as what the user requirements are ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no not specifically .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "more to how to get them and ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "got some requirements it has to be user-friendly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "really easy to use buttons , not very small buttons , but not the also the big buttons , but just normal buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it has to be small unit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it has to be , you can take it with you everywhere in your house .", "speaker": "B"},

distance from your television to your remote control has to be , quite big distance .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it has to be capable for zapping .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "from the other end of the room ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't have anything more to add at the moment .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the best is to go to work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that you or alright .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "any more points to discuss ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can go ahead with what we have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the use of the industrial designer can work on the working design , etcetera .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it seems you get more information by email .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that was it for me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in the project folder .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are you going to put the notes on the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm writing very fast .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "hope it's readable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "anything more you want to add to the discussion ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no i'm just bit wondering what we're gonna do the next session ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do we only have to do phase one , the functional design ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because then we have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "after that we are going to the conceptual .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're just working the three phases .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you do some individual work , we have meeting , individual work , meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and at the end of the day we have final meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then have to prepare have to defend our design , so make it good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll do our best .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "depend on you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "better make it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause it's fairly important to components we want to put in .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you can mix it it's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do we , is it gonna be multimedia control centre ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that is my question also because like new functions requirements .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that is the user requirements part .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as to what they want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do they want all those functions on that small .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we need good communication about this , 'cause have to put the components into the design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if what components to put in , it's hard .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was like li like some remotes who are out there , which know , there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have first to start with the basic functions and we can expand them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can always add few .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the c_d_ player .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and another function i'll think of switch to your media centre , because that's getting very popular .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then use your windows media centre under your t_v_ with the same remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so with the switch , one single switch records and like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you mean , but you'll ne need several other buttons for video player .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you need play and forw fast forward and stop function .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you don't need that for t_v_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and for teletext you need additional buttons as , so need to we need .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you need additional .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "whatever , i'll just put my ideas in here and then we can discuss it with the next meeting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in the project .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could just start with the assumption that's only for t_v_ and video .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and reserve the possibility to add other features .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we have basic starting point and you can always extend that so make it's extendible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it has to be user-friendly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's hasn't it's .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the least amount of functions possible so it's easier to get to know how it works etcetera .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and i'll
