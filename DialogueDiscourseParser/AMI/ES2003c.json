[{"edus": [{"text": "so we'll start off with quick overview of the minutes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we've set out .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "those are we were going to go for what seemed to be fairly minimal design based on small joystick , and couple of other buttons for navigation with power being suppose one of the main single purpose buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that sums up the last one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we'll just crack on , like to start with the industrial designer if it's possible .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the con today is the concep today .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll just have presentation saved it in the folder .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this meeting is the conceptual design phase and is about this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and is to cover things like what the parts might be made of , can we outsource these from elsewhere , will we have to construct any items ourselves ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'ll just i'll load it up then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which one do , interface concept ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we've got trend watching , that's you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's components design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the case le that's what wrote first of all , could be plastic our plastic .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but later on we found out that it can be rubber as , or titanium or even wood .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we decide what it's gonna be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we need the infra-red transmitter .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "get that off the shelf .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it , could be plastic or rubber even as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you go on to the next slide .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you go on to findings , it's like two or three slides down .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , this is what found we can use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "three different types of batteries .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can either use hand dynamo , or the kinetic type ones , that they use in watches , or else solar powered one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now , the kinetic one , we've 'cause that's the ones where like you the movement causes it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the bat the battery for watch wouldn't require lot of power , would be my one query .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's also watch moves around deal more .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you think ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which suppose as would allow us to go off the shelf again , you'd say ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and solar cells , about that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we should probably just use conventional batteries .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just like in usual remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one is flat one , and then more original ones are single curved one or one with double curved .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the materials are tha there as you can see , but you can't have titanium one for double curved , which would be , and light .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "titanium , the really strong metal , titanium ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is it not also it's expensive ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so as , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they make mountain bikes out of that , don't they .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's really light as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you'd be able to off the top of your head or not , the single curved and double curved , would you be able to give an example ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "could you draw something ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you don't doesn't have to be perfect , it's just 'cause i'm not quite if understand the difference between the two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for curved , was thinking to for to sit in your the palm of your hand .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like this , with the joy pad here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and an button around here , so that the thumb can use it quite easily .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't exactly double curved .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it probably means this is probably double curved .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "whereas single curved would be like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or not necessarily .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it might literally just be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "whereas this is two curves .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's what they mean by double curve .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which it looks better than the single curve , but you can't have it in titanium , which is material .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and for the buttons , it can have the scroll wheel which they use in mouses for com p_c_s .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it requires more expensive chip to use , and if you wanna use it's even more expensive .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you have to decide , there's trade-offs there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you want the buttons to be , if you have double curve control and it's rubber , then you have these rubber buttons as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you're gonna ha reckon you're gonna have to have key number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you wouldn't want to just have to scroll through all the channels to get to the one you want .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you wanna enter just the number of it , if it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so reckon we're gonna have to have number keypad anyway .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you think ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that was definitely something we can talk about .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you've got little bit about the chip that we might require as ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , depends where gonna spend the money if you want the fancy display .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you have any idea so far , like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an , does that in shoot the cost up by drastic amount ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "need an advanced chip for the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is that did advanced , like three eight six advance .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "compared to say just pressing buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you press button that sends certain transmission through the infra-red , whereas if we're controlling the we definitely require much more powerful chip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just compared to the chip you would use for pushing buttons is the point being made .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if i've not over-stepped .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the previous slides just explain what's in the internal components of the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "should go on , or go back ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we only have twelve pounds fifty , twelve euros , not even twelve pounds .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "twelve euros , what's that , like eight pounds like that , nine pounds ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'d also be relying on the bulk buying in producement and such .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's good point .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have to look into the costs of those .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you go to the one before that so it just says what it does , translate the key press into an infra-red signal and this is received by the t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the chip just needs to detect the signal or detect the key press and then it'll send it to the tr the amplifier .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then the next slide just shows how the copper wires interact with the buttons , the rubber buttons , to get sent to the chip .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's just how the control works inside .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have to decide on what buttons we're gonna use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so in the information that you've been supplied , how feasible would you say that the idea of using an looks ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can do it if we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then use single curved case .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because we might need it to be curved for the thumb to use the joyst joystick easily .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then you'll need the advanced chip for the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that sounds like quite good requirement to me .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "conventional battery would seem to make sense .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm not if there's any cost differences between single and double curved and i'm about anybody else , but plastic or rubber as traditional form of casing would seem to be good way forward ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm actually gonna be bold and go oo go straight for rubber for reasons i'll go into in more detail .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also have preference for rubber .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", will we move on to user interface , and ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "based on my research .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as long as were you ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and interface concept .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now i'm gonna have to work between the slides and the white board 'cause actually have some fairly concrete things this time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was given an h_t_m_l_ file giving various ideas from other previous remote control designs , and decided to just dump them all .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wasn't very impressed by them and they didn't seem to re nothing saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what ra rather than looking at other remotes , ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and try and figure out way of laying out the elements we've already decided on , so that if so that the finger is each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so next slide , if you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and what we've decided on was the joy the joystick , two function buttons and the , just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't actually think we need the numeric keypad because if you because one of the menus that we could have available via the is one where you scroll through channels , so if there's something and be bear in mind since this isn't meant to work for di for digital or for cable , whatever , you're looking at four or five terrestrial channels , and then your v_c_ and then the channel through your v_c_r_ and or d_v_d_ player .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and or box .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's not i'm not really excessively concerned about that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you must have two modes , basic mode , where the joystick's left for channels , up down for volume , and the menu mode for further functions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now the reason was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have highly ergonomic design , it needs to be ergonomic for left or handed people .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can jump in slightly there ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate , then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "basi what the what be having , would say , the whole thing articulated at two points , so that if you if you're handing it from lef left or handed user you can adjust it so that the l_c_ the and the joystick would be in the place .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and also this is rather nicer de design gimmick that the whole thing it should have organic feel to it that it should be , soft to touch and can be moved around all .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "on to the next to the next slide .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just to let we'll probably be quite tight for time as , because you've probably got lot you'd like to say , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "add pretty pictures to this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the assuming the hand to be in about this position , hol holding the remote , the joystick unit should rest over the joint of the four finger so that it's directly accessible for the thumb .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it would need there would need to be it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for left or handed users .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you then have grip section that can be more or less the same irrespective of handedness .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you just have big two big buttons that cover most of the area so it can in the upper part , one for the four finger , one for the middle finger .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that this part here is the joystick .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is this the joystick ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this would be the actual grip .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "probably where you'd want to have the battery as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would be probably the bulkiest part .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you then have , at the bottom , the , and this would need to be articulated as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and i'd want this to rest here , at the base of the wrist .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it would fit just nicely in the hand .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this part could be rotated , so it can so that it can be adjusted to either left or handed user .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch and menu mode would be the enter button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then the bottom function buttons switches between modes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now programming it actually thi this is one thing i've found with the replacement remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "programming them can be pain .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the simplest way around that would be to have cable to connect it to the computer some fair iv fairly simple software on the computer just so that you on your computer just so that you could pr program it at rather in rather more comfortable interface .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you could download programs for it from for t_v_s from all main manufacturers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "though you it would be necessary to have ha have mode for programming it without the computer , just in case there are still people left out there who don't have them yet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's my idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so to gather my research , two basic methods .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we compared whether people want the remote control to do lot of or they want it to look .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then we research fashion trends in europe , what's the new black , as it goes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we found , in order of importance , people want the remote control to look more than they want it to be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as in they want it to do lot of good they want it to look like it does lot , and if it does do lot that's bonus , but they don't care so much , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they want it to be that's sounds bit like contradiction .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "technology technical technologically innovative .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "people want it to be that , but still they care more about the way it looks than what it does .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so like the interface is really important .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and easy to use , it just so happens that from the second point to the third point is twice as important the second point is twice as important as the third point .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "people want it is it has to be cooler than easy to use , if it has the newest features , even if it's difficult to use , prefer it to have the newest features .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if it's easy to use that's bonus .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the fashion , now this is seems bit odd to me , but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture , for clothes , for shoes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how that relates to remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but see come on to that in the next in the next slide .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've als i've been saying everything's the new black .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "spongy's the new black as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we have the choice between rubber and plastic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze , it's spongy , then can skip the rest ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "forgot to mention that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the rubber material is the type of stress ball material , not just normal rubber .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so kinda spongy material .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "forgot to say that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so my personal opinion ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but what we need is something that looks like it's from the future that looks , that's different , that's everyone has white remote control , black remote control , you need something .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like , titanium is but it's expensive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it's bit of overkill for remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now the fruit and veg options , either we go in that direction or we stay away from it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the research did come up with fruit and veg , so it is important for it's the up to the interface guy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if we stay away from it , stay away from it , but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple like that , or kiwi fruit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it could be something like , say potato peeler but i'm you have much cooler idea than do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so is the key .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "few questions about spongy remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've never seen one before .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've seen plastic remote controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they were , back in the day when they first came up with remote controls , they had reason for it being sturdy , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for being strong and sturdy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if we want something strong and sturdy , say stay with plastic or titanium , but if we go with spongy , we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want , it doesn't matter , it's spongy material , it's not gonna break , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how the l_e_d_ and the lights are gonna fit into spongy material because it's not gonna be completely squeezable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so how do things fit it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if we are gonna use spongy , we can say it's long lasting , it's damage resistant and like that , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so just to summarise , people want that's , that's that looks like it's , and if it is then that's bonus doesn't have to be people like fruit and veg .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can either go down they or stay away from it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "people like spongy material .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is , and how we can further promote that idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also , this was this year .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , things change all the time , every year they always talk about this year , this is the new black .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "next year something else is gonna be the new black and we're stuck with last year's fruit and veg type .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining year's lead on most people anyway .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you always have to bring out new designs , so if we can get next year then that's possibly good place to start anyway .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "seems like lot of the components could be off the shelf , so don't exactly what cost would be incurred .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "see your point about the number keypad , but i've would say that we can probably incorporate it into the menu system if you need to do traversal of large number of channels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my feeling would be that even if at later date this was to be taking control of boxes as having the use of the and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers for you to be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "actually if you've got lot of channels , the number keypad can be quite annoying as , becau it's if you're trying to remember what , what number's the discovery channel or whatever .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's just irritating .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's good point .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can incorporate names into the menu .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if you but if you have me but if you have menu structure , then you can sub-group them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "even news , music .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like they do on sky digital kinda .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what it looks like to me is we'll use large number of standard components , say something like lithium ion battery , the kind that you find in most small hand held devices now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "looks like we going for double curved design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what cost implications there are in that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "looks like we're decided on some flexible rubber .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "though i'd have to say depending on how flexible it is , we might need to have some inner frame .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would say definitely , the idea of having it articulated there would be two points of articulation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one below and one above the main grip .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you think there's any way we could remove the articulation ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "see why it looks appealing , but it could be weak point in the structure , do you think ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would be worry of mine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you're going with the fruit and veg thing , looks like banana .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you wanna design it that way .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't thi don't think that it would be structural weakness , if you have firm sub-structure , you can then incorporate articulation into that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you then have outer skin of flexible , spongy rubber then you have something that is very much organic , and would look rather co mi rather .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my drawing there doesn't do it justice , it makes it look more little bit more like vibrator than remote control , but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we won't add that functionality .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "however , one interesting point is , how serious you were there , but we if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's an certainly different colour from your average that's true .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "make it harder to lose , as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was there anything in your research .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the noise for when you lose the banana , for when you lose the remote control , it could be like monkey noise like that , rather than standard beep .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you lose the monkey the banana , you lose the banana , you press button , and you hear like monkey screams like that to direct you towards the banana .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it that's something that could perhaps be programmable , though have monkey as default .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was gonna talk about the programmable remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now it'd be if you had one remote control that could work with all t_v_s , you click button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but why you'd need to program it like as standard feature , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "basi the for each manufacturer will have partic will have particular command set that the t_v_ responds to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not simply matter of frequency .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so usually what's done is you have this big booklet full of different possi you'll have all of them programmed in to the remote , and you'll have this little booklet of codes you then find your ma find your manufacturer and try the different codes that come under that manufacturer's name 'til you find the one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's because televisions , they don't give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's quite annoying and we probably would still have to do that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if we had some hook-up to your computer as an option , then if you've got computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "an interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer , we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes , we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the and then they look up different names of different actual units that have been produced .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or we have the remote control just go through them until it's like does this do the correct function , and such .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it actually book of names to digits , or is it like few pages ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was just thinking , if we were to store this information , some type of mapping .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this person probably need to use this feature like once , when you first buy the remote control , or whenever they buy new television , so once every , and it's .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "doesn't have to be used very often , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it's nuisance .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it's nuisance very close to the to actually purchasing it , so it's something that you're likely to be thinking about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you if there's one in the shop that's that says it can avoid much of that nuisance , you might be favourably inclined towards it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this just to give us rough idea of what we're meant to be doing for the next stage .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm pretty that you got that anyway .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is the conceptual one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we've come up we've covered everything we need to here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we've decided on what , decided on standard items for most of rubber and such , so we're now looking at the detailed design and what we need to be doing for the next meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , i'll just start at the top , you've got yourself and the industrial designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage 'cause it'll be hard not to , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "looking from prototyping of some des description using clay .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "suppose you'll be told lot more about that as progress .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the user interface design , they're it looks they're the idea i've pushed forward so far is more of physical one there , whereas possibly be more interested in how the l_c_d_'s going to incorporate , do you think ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or do you perceive that most the design decisions still need to be based on the physical layout ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "other than ge getting more aesthetically pleasing form for it , mo most of the layout design decisions are made , would say .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then again , the menu structure to considerable extent that's gonna vary according to the model of television , and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so and one of the things about having an and menu structure is that there is that flexibility to it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's very true .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "got product evaluation as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you see don't some of these things kinda logically follow the others .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how can product evaluation , doesn't that come after actually seen product prototype .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we'd be , no , it'd be more case of how do we envisage us performing the product evaluation once we have model to test with .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the , .", "speaker": "C"},
