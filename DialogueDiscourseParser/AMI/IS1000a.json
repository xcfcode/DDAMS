.", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "see what our roles are in this project .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , we have been provided with some technical tools to communicate and to , learn from each other's plans as say so we will also try to get acquainted to this tools so they are also new to me whether you worked with them before .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then we will come to the actual project plan .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you all hope how it's about the new remote control we are going to design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then we will discuss , how it should be and wh what our new product should look lite like .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then after some twenty five minutes hope we can end this meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is about new remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we when you design new product you of you want it to be original .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "be we want to be distinguished , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "people want to when they look at the shelf want to think , that's the product need .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it needs to be trendy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "trendy is what people want , so then they will buy our product .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but then , it also should work user friendly and otherwise people will not be rated very consumer articles and like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , the general outline of new project will be we first go through functional design phase .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you all get certain task in this phase and then we will meet again and discuss this functional design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the same holds for the ph two phases after this , the conceptual design and after that more detailed design in which the final project should get its definite shape .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "alright , but first we will do some tool training .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in all in front of you see the notebooks and note blocks and we have here white-board .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "whitebo , you can start it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and should work i've read it from my from some colleague that it should work with some toolbar .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "didn't find out yet how it work , but

.", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this seems to me , yes , some computer program but didn't find it yet .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , we'll come to that later .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , now we will try out the white-board we have here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , would suggest , yes , we should try to draw on it and then should be smart some way .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "each of us is going .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm not really how this works , but yes , good idea mael .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for us it's just like normal whiteboard , but they'll be recording what we write down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , but it's actually , not go with .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no they will record through that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's

"speaker": "B"}, {"text": "someo anna , you can start .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then he can find out to get his cord .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have to draw .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so why don't you draw your favourite animal on the white-board .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my favourite animal .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is all tangled up here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so draw it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we will try to what it is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm very bad drawer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you're not gonna be able to from my drawing .",

"speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which animal has not been drawn yet .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you've all drawn land animals , so why not draw an animal from the water .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in the water .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what that is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's bit hard to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the cat is going to eat the fish or the rat ?", "speaker":

"D"}, {"text": "you should go for the next one it seems to me .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let's continue to the real .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "our project finance thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "when we are and when you are going to design we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product will be about twenty five euros , so when designing project also look at you mael , keep in mind people want to get the feeling this is twenty five euro project pr product .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "per remote control , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "more interesting for our company , profit aim , about fifty million euro .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we have to sell quite lot of this things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we will try to get at international market so it will be mainly europe and northern america , some asian countries .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the sale man , four million .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also important for you all is the product production cost must be maximal twelve euro and fifty cents .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's half of the selling price , if am good in mathematics .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we still have to make profit , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they have to sell at least four million to make profit we have to make we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you all have to be paid .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you're very good in mathematics .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fifty mill it should have on off button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so when we are working on the international market , in principle it has enough customers so when we have good product we could meet this aim , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , that about finance .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and now just let have some discussion about what is good remote control and keep in mind this first point , it has to be original , it has to be trendy , it has to be user friendly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "someone can mention some additional prerequisites for good remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , it should have the expected functionality of remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it depends what application you are using it for .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you might need we are targ targeting the television set .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we wer we were thinking television .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , you need to record the channels .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you need to browse the channels in upward downward way , and marketing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's very handy always miss it and on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of retyping the number , especially when you have lot of channels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and just before starting the detailed discussion , we you are the marketing guy ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or so you are the marketing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and you are in the use user interface design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so just wanted to be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and i'm the industrial designer .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because you very , actually , but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "happy to meet you .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's very so just on your web page but not face to face .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and matthew , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and i'm nanne .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "are there some other very important things to do , to specify in this first phase of the project .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so like what ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so and , you'd need the usual ones , like the changing the volume , changing the channel and then you today we have teletext and all those things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the browse function , as you mentioned .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "tomorrow you might have some more functions which might come through that , so i_p_o_ or .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like internet on the on t_v_ ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now we are looking for television things or i_p_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we can't really design that hasn't been invented yet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's coming up , actually .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the personal video recorder and all those things it is coming up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you two should , think this over espec what , what functionality .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "actually , and first before designing the func thinking about the functionalities , we need to are the user requirements .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's take in that case you can you always hook up with someone who is providing that and , you sell their product as your product with them , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then if they need internet , then we would be able to propose something with t_v_ over i_p_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but before , but we want to design new one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but ninety percent of the time , ninety nine percent of the time , people will be using the main functions , the volume , the different channels , so we can have all the fancy things as but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "keep in mind it's twenty five euro unit , so the very fancy we can leave that out , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so twenty five euro you expect quite , normal but good functioning user friendly remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so try and get t_v_ manufacturers to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , it's , understand .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we need some numbering buttons , some teletext things and then .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the , the main is browsing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , but ab about the spec the buttons , the buttons that will be on it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can discuss that in the next meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would like to get this wrapped up and go to an end of this meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so now the basic things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we are alread .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and just for the next meeting , you wor yes , work on design , keep it general , so we will be still fle flexible with adding some functions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you will be working on technical function design , so and you and , think about requirements , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "does it need internet , or do we stay at basic television interface .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , we should now all go work at this and you will be informed via email and other communication .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so next meeting will be in thirty minutes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "keep it in mind .", "speaker": "B"}], "id": "xxxxx", "relations": [{"y": 1, "x": 0, "type": "Explanation"}]}]
