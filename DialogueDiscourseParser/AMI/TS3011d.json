the speaker but even without it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "something like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm here , i'm here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have to programme it once , so to that respond to certain word or certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing i'm here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so something like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , me too .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should not stay too long on this subject because of the time , but personally give it one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the feel of the remote control

.", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are cases in which the outside casing is can be how do you prono is moldable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was it one of our options ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , it's not one of our option , but when you look in the market , when you look yes , but that's not what they are talking about , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this was most spongy option .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , in the in .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because we compare all these characteristics with market with the real market .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so there are remote controls out there which are lot more spongy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they're out there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they're out there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but in this case in this case we've done the best we could .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , but it's not good enough , so it's two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll give it one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wan i'll take one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you take one ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what do you give it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "know , but you have to name fig number .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because we need to go on in for the time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if give it one there'll be one hell of calculation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it will be one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so i'll just give it two and make this one point five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll change it , i'll make it my mark will be four .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the remote control offers enough features .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ruud , what do you think about it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the basic layout doesn't offem offer much , but the voice recognition could add lot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , depends .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's completely programmable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can add very much functionality by using the voice recognition mode .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's quite advanced .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what we didn't talk about is it has .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it ha doesn't has the digits .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "believe it's if you ask yourself it offers enough features , don't is it has all the features normal remote has .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "depends on what you implement in the speech feat signal .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "bec because you can we didn't talk about it , but you do have remote controls that are able to adapt another signal .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , you place regular remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it records the signals .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "has the signals sent to it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you could enter any comment you like , as long it's able to as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is remote control with very high level of features .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "although there are few buttons , but the inside is quite advanced .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that that's its power , because regular programmable remote control contains , really lot of buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "at least forty buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's quite complicated to get used to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and this is quite simple .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can use your voice to programme it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's , i'll give it one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let's give it number .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll give it one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for the for this type of market , it's one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll give two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "think one , 'cause with voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like even because it doesn't look advanced .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i've we've succe succeed in developing product that's actually quite good , but not for this market , and not for this price .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so high quality , low acceptance .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the product is high qua has high quality and is advanced .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but whether or not our clients are willing to pay twenty five euros for this device is doub is , is not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you agree ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , agree .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should have radar function .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we could couldn't what what's the selling price ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "twenty five euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and costs were twelve fifty .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but even now , if only our production costs were exceeded the double , think .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "production cost was were was twenty two ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so selling price would be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "about fifty euros .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's quite ex , it's not very expensive for remote control that has this functionality .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's price , but no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "an original remote control of any t_v_ kind , phillips remote control , you pay , kn know from few years ago , it costed hundred gilders .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , it's more than fifty euros .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's quite expensive , yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "bu but , know , but you're paying for the brand , because there are remote controls which control your stereo , television , d_v_d_ , c_d_ player , for under twenty five euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , but you can you yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it's easier to use because
