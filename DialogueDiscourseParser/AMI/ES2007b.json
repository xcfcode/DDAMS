get things going , get people talking and i'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this for the purposes of this meeting what this meeting is all about is i'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you , what you've been working on for the last wee while , when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and , filling out silly questionnaires and things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but hopefully you've been actually been doing something productive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're gonna each of you gonna give us litt little presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we're gonna work , from each of your presentations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll talk about what we actually need

one particular medium .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you haven't had time to prepare one , you can draw on the noteboard , you can talk to us , you can however you want to do your little

finishing off my presentation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright , let's have , we all know that it's remote control that we're gonna be dealing with .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the first thing we should look at is probably the what it is that it is actually supposed to be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's gonna be you catherine , if we wanna hear from you first .", "speaker": "A"},

gonna draw it on the board then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's in blue , and couldn't change it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we it's fine on my screen , but never mind .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the idea is that we've got the energy source , which in our case will pr , never mind .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so two batteries , what they're called six , like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then on the remote control itself will have the sender for the signal , which could be an infra-red signal , which will be sent by an electronic chip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the chip will be controlled by the user interface .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we'll hear about that later from gabriel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the sender will send to the telly

very clear but really ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "prefer the pe prefer the human touch personally .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should erase this or .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you wanna just give us moment , wanna copy this down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you have got any questions for catherine on any of this ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is battery like the only way of no , no like no 'cause like cha 'cause always changing batteries can get like annoying .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , in indoors .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "alternate energy source , like win wind power or bicycle power .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you blow on it and , it's worked for the last fifty years .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the battery's down and , solar charged ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "swi changing your batteries once every six months is not really pain , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one question have , and how much control we have over this is , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the t_v_ , and still have it be operational ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we want one with strong signal stream .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how far away is your television ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got t_v_ the size of football pitch , it's not doesn't have to go that far , does it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the thing is you don't , we can make the signal strong enough to go through walls if you fancy it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "doesn't have to go through wall , because you're not gonna be looking through wall .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off and you don't really want to go into the put the telephone down , and go into the other room .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "didn't think about that but why not ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how about bluetooth ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "instead of using infra-red , use bluetooth .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "isn't that better signal ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "think that it's gonna cost more and i'm not it's you're gonna use it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it sounds like you don't wanna overcomplicate things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we don't need it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's fancy idea it's quite , but then don't , either you if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room , you are gonna but , we can keep the idea if you we can see at later stage , don't do you need the border ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're desi we're designing and marketing television remote control unit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're not designing something that you can plug in headset to and connect to your laptop computer and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'s just an idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "done , catherine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "gab gabriel let's hear from you on such things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm just gonna use the powerpoint .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , while this is warming up , there it is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i'm doing the user interface design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , as far as methods , was looking at already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , what we can perfect little bit as far as design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we don't want to do something that's too radical of change , people want remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities and does the basics , but so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so things that seem like absolute must-haves would be volume control , so up-down keys for that , channel keys up-down , but then also numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and mute button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one thing that didn't include here , that forgot that we talked about last time , was doing some lock function .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't , that's one possibility .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so in the research that was doing there's two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which if access the web page from here , but show you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , freeze frame .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and this is user centred one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's easier to just glance at this and see what's possible to do , you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and judging from what we all talked about during our last meeting gathered that that's what we were going after , or the direction we were going in at least .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , the engineering centred ones provide lot of functionality , but it can be little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and this overlaps with what the marketing person , reissa , because we need to find out what people want before we make firm decisions on this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , that's me .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now that's have question for you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this research that you've been doing looki looking at other , existing units .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no that seemed like novel idea as far as know .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "another exists like you said in mobile phones .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that was the inspiration for it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've never seen that with in all my years in the remote business .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've , haven't i've never seen locking functionality .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what do you have yea or nay on that feeling about whether that's really necessary ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would say it's if it's simple to do , which it probably should be , even if it's physical , like physical switch or physical cover for the remote , even something like that , then yes , it's like , like you said earlier on ab flip thing , something like that , but being physical .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred , something we should take into account is we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's gotta look like it's in the and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the company it's , from what see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and our motto is we put the fashion in electronics .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we put the fashion in electronics .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to carry that mental .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and something fashionable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if remote control , if telephones can be fashionable , then remote control units can be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "these , we can so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what didn't mention yet really is the like the ergonomic design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because we need .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "everything is going ergonomic , there's mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches in the market , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "done , gabriel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "where does it go into ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's plug you in , baby .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the blue thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", this is getting all .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then you just have to do function eight and it should come up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it just takes wee while .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it just takes second .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for our marketing report we observed remote control users in usability lab , and also gave so this is research and we also gave participants questionnaires to fill out .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "total number of people tested were hundred just so , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so they don't like the look of the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really and fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we all agree with that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "current remote controls do not match with the operating behaviour of the user .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , they don't like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause we've only got five channels .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's another thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "seventy five per cent of users say they zap .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not quite what they mean , zap , goes like .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's flicking quickly between channels .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you wanna navigate the channels quickly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "takes too much time to learn how to use new remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "especially for the older generation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "anyway and they also remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so tracking devices is good idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you are child of technology , aren't you ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "has to look really , flashy groovy for people to buy it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it's easy to find , so whether and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they'd be interested in voice activating .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so voice activation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so and this was what we came up with .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then if you look fifteen to twenty five this is age , age groups .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two ninety one per cent of them said yes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so there you go , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want voice activated one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want voice act speech recognition in remote .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but do the younger generation have the money ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no would say the older people , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and people from the age of thirty there's big drop off there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent say no , so they don't these are growing up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , they want it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but no they're not most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five , 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would be my as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and tha and that's quite minority there , so , it's not even like fifty that's thirty five per cent .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what about just from the prospective of our manufacturing cost ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if it's twelve fifty per unit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "voice activation might not be the best .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would say scra i'd say scrap that straight off .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also with buttons , thing called r_s_i_ , so wrist sense ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "repetitive strain rep repetitive strain injury or like from doing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "repetitive strains injury , so they don't people who watch t_v_ too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they shouldn't watch so much t_v_ then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's so you got so that's something we should have look into then when desi when designing the ergonomics of see have look if there's any medical background we can find out about this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not so hard .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let's jus we just want need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we should probably consult with our legal department .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they're having lunch break at the moment , but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll see if get see if get hold of them for the next meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can do some really in that department , the ergonomic department , we can make some really good improvements .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the buttons not so high up so you don't have to press so much , or we just like flat buttons , something .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that is me .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's , very much for that , reissa .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we've decide we've decided that it's gonna be , we're going for basic television remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's gotta be safe to use , it's gotta look .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's gotta be cheap .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now going back to the industrial design of it , we were looking at whether to use infra-red or bluetooth .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we should just go with the simplest option on everything , and that would be infra-red , energy source , that would be batteries .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "mean we can look into using the , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but in there's no don't think there's any point in making remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years , because technology will have changed and , we won't have televisions in ten years' time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're all pretty sussed on that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "anyone have any questions ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "everybody happy in their work ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it seems like we're all on the same page .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now this is good , we've got good structure going on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we all know where we're going to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have you been ge has have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's probably just you , 'cause you're the project manager .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "sell trying to sell your things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do have you found out if we can if we can e-mail to each other ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do all you all know my e-mail address ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "he's participant one , aren't you ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in the project announcement , you've got the addresses , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's just participant one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so project manager , it's participant one at a_m_i_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can you all e-mail me your e-mail addresses ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "t's just it's just par participant one , participant two .",

"speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so are we headed towards like big yellow and black remote as far as that's our next meeting that we discuss that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "thought it was blue writing on yellow background , but might be just going bit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's like white on white and blue on black background with white with yellow borders .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's like getting ahead of ourselves .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can come up with few with couple of different ideas ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it wouldn't be you could it could come but it could come in different colours and have the r_r_ colours just somewhere like just around the lock button could be the r_r_ logo or colours and if .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can't we have different colours in the remotes , so somebody can choose different col like does it have to be of certain ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "see the thing is we've gotta keep the company image .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's gotta say people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that it's real reaction product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if it's r_r_ , it would be real reaction , like if it had symbol on it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there's loads of companies that called r_r_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is slog but this is the slogan , this is the type .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and this is something that came on down from the higher ups , so , we are beholden to them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we have to have it one colour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we have to incorporate it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not necessarily even if it just has to ye but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products as opposed to sony product or , panasonic product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's got to so , so you can have look at our other products and see if they all follow similar vein , perhaps .", "speaker": "A"},
