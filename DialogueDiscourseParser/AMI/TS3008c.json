[{"edus": [{"text": "welcome to the conceptual design meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll again be the secretary and make minutes , take minutes , and it will be three presentations , just like the last meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , who wants to start off ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "technical designer again ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "before we begin it , want to say i've put the minutes of the second meeting in the shared folder , but they're still not quite .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it still some technical difficulties so the first part of the minutes are very hard to read , because there are two documents that were layered over each other .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so but , from now on won't use my pen anymore , so will be just ordinary keyboard .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "may be better , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it will be more easy for you to read the minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when we talk about components design , it's really about the material and the and really the we build the remote controls of .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "remote control consist of components and the components of remote control consist of properties and material .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have to choose these wisely and it could affect grow of in buying the remote controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the components of remote control are the case .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the properties of the case , it has to be solid in hard material like hard plastic with soft rubber for falling and , it feels good in your hand .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the buttons has to be solid too , and the material is soft rubber .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've got email from the possibilities of real reaction .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they're telling me that when we build remote control of plastic or rubber , the buttons have to be rubber too .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when we use rubbled doubled curved case , we must use rubber push-buttons to the rubber double-curved case is three-dimensional curve in the design , which is necessary when we want to be trendy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the energy source , i've got lot of possibilities for that too .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the basic battery , which thi prefer because of its non non-depending of here you have to have hand , kinetic energy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also in this one , like in the watches , but remote control can lie on table for day , and then you push button and so you don't have to walk with it all the time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "solar cells are also bit weird for remote controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also the case material , that plastic is the best with rubber , because wood or titanium would also be bit weird .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "titanium is probably trendy , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's true , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "little bit expensive .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they don't tell anything about the cost of titanium .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the chip set and the board is all off the shelf .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also , the speaker in the remote control , when we want to retrieve it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the base station is also off the shelf , all the materials and the components are just available in our factory .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've told about the three first points .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the simple electronical chip is available with the led transmitter .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's all off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all available in our company .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "looked up on was the displays .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "could be something special to our remote control , and it's possible , but it only cost bit more , but it can be within the limits of twenty five euros .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "twelve and half .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually what are those , tooth brushes , or so but it's actually , it resembles the design had in mind for this proj the cartoonish alessi design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "got an email with some examples and it these were the most trendiest one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you see covers , which can be , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "different colours also .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , we can bri bring couple of types of whole set of different remote controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we can steal their ideas .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can bring whole line with huge variety of house .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's possibility , too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like radios and television also in this in the same style , but yes , because we have to we have to we have to bring the logo and all the back into it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that'll be for the future , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "next time we're here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "shall go to the next slide .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "still don't have any information about user requirements .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was thinking about just the basic functions and got , but then wh when there are new user requirements .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we decided upon that in the last meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ha have the have nothing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "tha didn't receive any new requirements or someth no , but we decided to use only basic functions only .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have here couple of basic functions could think of .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if they're little bit more , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can think of that later .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just these are the ones you already summed up in the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", pointed them out here , just to make it little bit easier .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "another function is we already discuss it on the side .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what costs of it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i've no idea about it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was also looking for what you said , for got an email about in front of the remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if that's good idea , or it's little bit too much for twelve and half .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we got already something like base .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that might get redundant also .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what information it would .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ju was just thinking about it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then got pop-ups to go to the meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can bring teletext to the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "little too little bit too big , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then you and then you've got flag very big r_c_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's not it was not good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the functions are not more to discuss , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's just the base things we already discussed that the no v_c_r_ or that , so that's very easy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you do mention the next and previous button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "next channel , previous channel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's next channel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "got an email with an remote control with base .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , it's just an idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and thinked of the button sizes and i'm not if they have to be big or just small , i'm not i'm the expert for user-friendly , but not for trendiness .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you're the expert .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it depends on the function .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it , that's your point .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you save perhaps tiny buttons aren't user-friendly , then we wouldn't im implement that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i've nothing to , with little bit larger , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "when we only use basic functions , we have the possibility to make the buttons larger .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , but with the , that groups .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we already upon the fact that the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons , those two have , they have to be large .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the two basic buttons , the to skip channels and to , why , but that is that's trendy too , because that's the mo it , it's acc accentu , how do you say it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "most the most used buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "those are probably the yes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it puts an extra accent on the simplicity of our remotes to make these two most basic functions extra big , like .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "those are probably the four most used buttons on the in the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you did the research .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you want to acc accentuate that , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's from your research .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that was all personal preference didn't have .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "didn't had any time left .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , that's coo it's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you don't care .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "click on it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i've done some research again about trends on the internet .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i've done some investigation , and got some information from fashion watchers from paris and milan .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "some findings the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", we were going to imply that , so that's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the second important thing is innovative technology in the r_c_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "our market really likes that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the third point there in this order if of importance , the third point , is high ease of use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , for the idea , i've put some trends for the market of elderly people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "dark colours , simple recognisable shapes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we probably won't do that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the younger market likes , the themes of this year are surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "found this image , which is , it symbolises the idea of fruits and vegetables .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't see the spongy part in it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but with little bit of fancy exactly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then we have to do something with sponge bob then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "got some ideas , pictures isn't really good word , but some symbols of fruits or vegetables .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fruit is yellow , green , red , whatever .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , remote controls in catchy colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it doesn't stroke with the dark colours .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , we don't want dark colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not the dark colours ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , put them there to , for general idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , the docking st the spongy material is very irritating for the remote control itself .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but to , the to implement some spongy thing , we can do it in the docking station .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "at the bottom of the docking station or whatever .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , we could bring one line with dark colour to how do you say ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "also bit for elderly people who are little bit crazy and want little younger design but still the dark colour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , but that our design already resembles so piece of fruit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how but how do we use fruits and vegetables in christ's sake with remote control ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it reaches different market , but it doesn't cost really much effort to bring like black r_c_ on the market or whatever .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there's always there there's always empty space on remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "make it banana ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's like pear .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this part of the r_c_ the upper part or whatever is not used with buttons , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , don't think you have to do it like , but it that doesn't have to remind you , like explicitly of our of specific piece of fruit , but just , like the round curves .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you can put some fruity things no , not .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so this it already sem resembles something like pear to me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , but that , but that's but don't we need creative artist like that to make it to feel like vegetable or fruit ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we make it little bit greenish .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you do get the idea , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the fruity round .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we could use one of these for the what is it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "isn't wha whatever .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have very big the of design team , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can produce multiple things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for big team of artists .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is then the pear .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the english word , so forget it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's pear , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , banana is not easy for remote control , but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we don't have to make we can't make all ten designs .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have to make one design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , but it's already what we were up to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "mayb two or three .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's it doesn't have to resemble what already said , specific piece of fruit , but just , like fruity thing going on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , but that's , and what was saying , the catchy colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it's it looks fruity to me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , but do like the , do like the to the idea of making , catchy colour design and because do dark colour would be too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but pictures of fruit , vegetables yes , you can put logo on top of it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's too much , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , we have to there have to be the firm colours , our own colours has to be in it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "pictures was bad word , but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but what are the this is yellow .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yellow , real reaction .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but don't think our company colours are this fashionable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can if we got our docking station over here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , it's really fruity .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we yellow do , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'t draw with this thing , but i'll try .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if this is our docking station , we can make our logo over here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it doesn't work .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then , the button over here or whatever , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the button then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "with strawberry on top .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on the bottom of the remote you can do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "on the front , because else you can't find it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that were my ideas little bit .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll close down .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can you open the conceptual design presentation ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "conceptual design , yes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "see what was on the agenda .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is his own remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because , we can start with the technical functions , but don't t's there , do we want to use an display , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "only if we can make t_v_ guide on it , for the channel you're on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but don't what to display on it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it should be li like this big , and don't think yes , but it has to show an entire title of programme or at least quite large part of it and then you get very large screen , because , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's so don't think we should do it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , only the t_v_ channel with the with four programmes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can zap through them with the page up page down button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , it can on your no , on your mobile phone you can read text also .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so why not on your remote ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do it's bit redundant , actually .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it's also not don't even it looks like sexy , it's but you're already watching the t_v_ , you're not gonna watch your remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ll what would you display on it then ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "programme information or guide on teletext , yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but is it isn't that already on t_v_ , lot of new t_v_s ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but lot of t_v_s show when you zap to but then we also need to bring out line of t_v_s which we were planning to , but whatever .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "also on the internet .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but yes , but you also want to 's next .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we also have to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because the t_v_ has to send information back to the r_c_ , and if that's possible .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , that's really possible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , it's possible , but you gotta implement it in the t_v_s , and don't think everyone's gonna buy real reaction t_v_ within month after the release of our remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and also , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "really understand you want to make your job more exciting by putting an in it , but really don't t's good goo because it also doesn't stroke with we wanted when we talk about the materials , it's good idea to use these plastic materials with soft rubber on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it was our idea , to give it more sturdy look and that you ca like you can throw with it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but don't think display fits in that image .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's like more vulnerable , and it adds nothing really , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's true , that's true , it breaks , it it's not very solid , it's frag fragile .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you could make it , but it's just it doesn't don't it's coherent with the design we're after .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't ei either .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that's my opinion .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you , we can vote for it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you want the display .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't want to and he doesn't , so it's up to him .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if we wanna and i've read somewhere that i've got some veto rights .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so also say but did we skip the , you could do but what so what but do you think we should we're not even what information we want to display on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can you away .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it's simple no , that , and also have to think about new functions , buttons like that to control it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no yes , you can use buttons that are already on the remote control for double functions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so nah , that's not gonna work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or but how does it display then ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "when go to the second channel , what does it show me ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then you push button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the title and the information about the programme .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "about that programme ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , what he said was , about the televisions , they have to be customised to the but in future it will be giant hit , and when you are the first you have the biggest yes , you can put little display on it with lots of information .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've seen it done before .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do like the bigger rem universal remotes , they have displays , but then it's very functional to indicate which what device you are controlling .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's that that's what i've seen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's true , if you .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it just it doesn't match with the our whole basic concept .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but haven't thought about it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but whe but when you put transparent plastic screen on top of it , it isn't vulnerable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can throw with it and when you put colour screen on it , it's very special and very trendy to have remote control from but i've got the email with the possibilities .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's not the most important , but it's just don't .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it fashion ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's not up to you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's up to market if it's trendy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you ha do you have to you haven't looked after the trendiness of displays , have you ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because our motto is we put fashion , if you want to be trendy you have to be coloured .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's pretty trendy , to be honest , but if , i'm coming back to the costs again , but we gotta build pretty cheap design to stay within our limits .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and especially colour , which is pretty trendy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but don't think , it will be too expensive .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and was possibility for the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so why don't we use it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "did it say price also for monogramme or coloured ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we're gonna if it then you better don't , really don't feel the whole idea of an display .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "coloured if you have black and white , or grey , that's it's too much with the and the docking station and with one thing special .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "really , if you in two thousand and four you can't put something on the market which is monogramme .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , but it doesn't sa say anything about colour or but , alf also got possibility to put scroll button on it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but didn't think that yes , but on the no , when but it look yes , but that remote controls are already on the market .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it can't co you cannot convince me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how to with you , but don't really feel it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we already we're , we already have the base station gadgets , and want and it , do it has to be simple design , which sturdy , which soft don't , and really , don't see how the display is gonna add anything , on design level .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've gotta find balance , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we have pear .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not whole package of specialty .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's slicker to have no l_ ceds .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we want to it's simplicity , you have two big buttons and you can do whatever you want with these two buttons , so you don't need an .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it doesn't fit in our philosophy behind the whole remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the simple yes , but when you want to have something special yes , but you had picture of it from another company .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we already have the docking station , which is it has to be developed , but no , but it that's our killer feature .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's just an it's just an idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's our what makes it special .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , it was already made .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "tha the remote control on the docking station .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we're gonna develop our own docking station .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that so ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was it wasn't just prototype ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , he have picture of it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "exactly , i've never seen it in store .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but re we really have to cut this off , re know you get the idea you really like it , the thing , but it's not good idea , and we have already mentioned all the arguments .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't , do you agre how do you think ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we skip the display .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , it's too much .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's little too much , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm , you can do something if we are at your own place , or make it happen in your basement .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "mayb will rule the world with it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but probably so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but for the technical part .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the material , it was good idea to use the plastic and the rubber .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , bit of cushion is yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is what it , but it was already what we're after , to give it , the soft touch in your hands and also to , know , like , that is the airbag thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for the spongy feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "with spongy bob feel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can st throw it at your little brother's head .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you just can drop it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you drop it if you drop it the airbag comes out , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , not that comfy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it but then we have to look that it will not be too childish to see .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's good point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's why like the dark col dark colour bit , because it may be the design , it's it is bit of the it's bit nineties , what we're up to rat fun to this point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but not black .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it's fruit and vegetables , it have to be colourful .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's true , but it has to be little big solid .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", that's what was pointing at .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but can we ge can we combine it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it mustn't be too , too overwhelming , then when you put it on your just .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with yellow and black ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "make it bee ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , don't like the yellow and black combination .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it is our company colours .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , real good colours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have to use yellow .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text":

very rough .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , that's difficult , because that's different material , and then you gotta have like two material lines of , if it's just colour which you change then , it's to have one of these .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is just no , we can make it from the same plastic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is an no , do like the idea of titanium kind type of

like two type of materials , like the plastic enclosure and then the pads that surround it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and pro and lights .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to incorporate the lights too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , do gonna are we going to give it two-tone colour look , like the plastic mould is in one colour and the cushion pads around it are in another colour ?",
