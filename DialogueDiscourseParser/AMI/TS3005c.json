[{"edus": [{"text": "welcome everyone to our next meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm busy writing and busy leading the meeting , but i've prepared little presentation once again or at least an agenda the biggest part of the presentation will be on your side .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we are here at the conceptual design meeting , which is hereby opened .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "once again will try to write some minutes which from the previous meeting placed inside our project folder , which was quite some typing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "today we once again have three presentations , if i'm , and after that we will take decision on the remote control concepts .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'d say let's start with the first presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in the same order as last time ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "take it away .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "welcome you all .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "components design , first of all would like to accommodate some of those things elaborate some of the things did .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "elaborated on the concept .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what should be said about the components , its properties and what materials should we use to make one of those remote controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "first of all i've subtracted some of the components that is that are used are from what the remote control's formed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would like to give you an idea of how about .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't destroy my giraffe .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "giraffe's gone now .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the case was is made from rubber , suppose .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's one of the because when you use remote control lot of people will drop their remote control and they break becau the titanium was also an option .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it's very expensive material .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "rubber is , the best suitable material to use for our remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's poss it's also possible to create fancy colours with rubber .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "rubber makes it easy to it lets itself colour .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "titanium you have to paint it and with that it's possible to scratch it or make it ugly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "rubber the total piece of rubber that's sor that's used to make the case is the same colour , so if you scratch it it's still the same colour , perhaps it's little bit damaged .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it's very strong material .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "had an idea single covered curved , single curved .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's two dimensional .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's best to draw green .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have to go it's side view .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's make it black .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "of an idea like this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it also looks when it's on your table .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you get it doesn't lay flat down on the table , but it's stands .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "side view yes it's side view so i'm not technically good at three d_ modelling , but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's just an idea had so it's very so its also looks when it's on the table .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the graphical user interface and the buttons , we also thought about that already .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "about the touch screen , which is easy to clean too .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one of the advantages of the screen you just use some or another cleaning cl some cleaning .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "already explained some properties of that material and also we almost concluded about that this should be our button component .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's all about the buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the batteries , we also thought about that already , will be chargeable with an option for mount station so you can put the remote control in mount station so its charges itself up instead of plugging it in like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they should be long lasting , not be empty in about two minutes or thirty minutes or forty minutes of use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and next step is the chip the component that's makes or transmits the signal to the television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there was an option to use rather simple chip but because of our highly requiring requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it with also the ability to facilitate speaker speech recognition which unfortunately is still in test phase , so there should be some more investigation on that side .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "my personal preferences also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use our own business colours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that was correct , wasn't it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they are rather boring for use with rubber .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "business colours it was the slogan and the corporate image , so , it needs colour , but don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they should be sh they should be in mind , wasn't it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it doesn't says to have the slogan ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it must be recognisable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could make little and on the top of the machine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can put the and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so they are pretty boring , suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours and also in lot of possible colours , so it's possible to make very fancy remote controls which peopl who people in which people will find they're interesting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and will buy them faster when they look at the same old grey or black colours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as said before rubber is impossible to damage severely imp instead of you can break it when you break it in with pair of scissors like that , but if you drop it it's not broken away instead of using plastic , hard plastic or titanium .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and personally liked the single curved remote control , because it makes sense .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's all about my findings .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "will go next .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "alright so little bit about the interface .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how it should look .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we determined that will not be no buttons , but only an screen , so had to look on that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the design is therefore based on what we just thought of .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and this is that you ask you give question through the device and it answers you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and they already put this in an in coffee maker .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so that it you say good morning , coffee maker , and it says to you back good morning joe or what's your name .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this and there's an easy way to program that you say record into the device into the speaker and then you say the question and three seconds later you say the answer and then when you say the question it gives you the answer .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "perhaps it's useful , perhaps for because people lose the remote , they can yell remote where are you and calls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and perhaps we could implement that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then have to go out of the presentation because tried to make some idea of how it should look like but 't draw , so don't make too much of it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "tried to the screen tried to draw .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "at least the icon for the volume .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if there is an icon for the program , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not just p_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "p_ , just p_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so and then the buttons above and below the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "where's the button for two ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "forgot that one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "forgot something , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the numbers , that should be bit larger it's not really on scale and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "an options button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the button for teletext apar apart because it's not really options , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's options is the settings of the remote and of the t_v_ and that thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so could call it settings .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but this is bit how it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the somewhere on the remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should , so that it's better in your hand .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but and microph microphone for the speech recognition if we want to implement that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then if you press the op options button , now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what you could do and that you could do with something like this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it's also think we discussed earlier that older people don't really want to use these extra settings .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and older people also don't really want to use this option menus .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so they want to use one button and then something happens , and not choose with this and you could put in an really little scrolling device on the side of your remote , so you could scroll across these things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's an option .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that was my finding dinge .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now our third team member with his presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "go danny , go danny .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm going to tell you something about trend watching .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the trends from the past years , what the people like , what the youngsters like , what the elderly people liked about shapes , colours , material and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the method used was like told watched the trends from the past years about colours , shapes , material they wanted from elderly and young people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we can keep that in mind for designing the device itself .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the second important thing that should be if inv in innov innovative , like the screen that's quite innovative so that should be meeting for this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the third thing is it should be easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "with only one menu , four button , channel , volume , it should also be enough for easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like banana yellow , strawberry red and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the round shapes , and soft material materials like the rubber .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it should be soft it should feeling spongy or sponge bob like things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's build it into sponge .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "elderly people like au colours which are being seen in autumn like woods dark brown , red , deep reds and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they liked square shapes with round edges .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and hard materials like wood , titanium .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they those materials they liked .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours , innovative , all the colours you see , the blue , the red , the white , the yellow , that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so for the older people , more traditional form .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's bit like banana .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the colour should be yellow , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and for the elderly people just plain old .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because we decided to have two remotes , two designs , or was it two colours ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it was one remote , different colours .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "different colours , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like my colleague , you said , is that's better , or for the elderly people something like the ipod , with round squares .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "simple but easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that is my , like the older colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you could change the colours , that was also the idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which shape you should take , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "colours the elderly people look something like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "changing colours will be easier than changing the shape of it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "changing just the shape of the remote control ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "perhaps you could find something in the middle .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "round corners , but square , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "round but square .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but then both groups won't buy it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you do it square , with round corners but little in the middle of it do what ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you mean , like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like this bit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's bit square , but it's also bit round .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "kinda like beer glass .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so but then same sides .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's also easy to have to put in your hand .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that's also how other remotes are shaped , so that's but perhaps that's good thing , so that's easy to use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "people know the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "will recognise that's as remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when saw your .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "autumn colours like red , brown .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they liked the wood lot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we could give it like wooden loo look in that colour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "kinda like old cars , let's put it all together .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and bit old school style renaissance , medieval things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "those , those things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you see the big difference between the young people ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fresh , exciting .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the old people , old and boring .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that's easily to do with the colour , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's easy to do with the colours , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's easier to do in colour than in shape .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because otherwise we have to get different shapes , and colour way easier than the shapes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in material rubber , rubber is , like said , young people like more soft materials and spongy ones and the old people like plain wood .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we have to decide if we're going to use real hard rubber , or soft rubber .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "think also in between .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "something between that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "soft rubber which you can feel in it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't think you should be able to mould it , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or wh what's something harder .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it should shouldn't be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no but you have to like eraser .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's the bit you can press it in , harder .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "bit like this rubber .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this but it's quite hard , this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "something like this , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's quite hard but you can press it in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's feels kind spongy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't t's rubber .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "are you going to invite sponge bob , he can that's the better thing to do .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we need spongy feeling .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did you have something about so we should first decide about shape , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which then you can fit the screen in it , and can decide .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "also can't help but notice that you used an you had remote control and the screen was rather small .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that screen should be like three quarter of the buttons won't get that small when the screen is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it it's supposed to be bit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this was your size , but it should be larger .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you don't have to put your .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "new , blank .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so when you get this kinda like this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or should it be larger ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because you want to put your hands you want .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if you pu now you can put your hand there and then you won't touch the screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "becau because you have , true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "perhaps that's best .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "your thumb here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but not on the screen because that's an idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "looks bit like game boy now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because when you put your but if yo if you make the screen as large as the remote control itself , you'll always get some you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you always touch it , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "going to be very greasy and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it won't get that small because you have how much ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one to zero , the two digit , you have to you have to because some fat people with thick fingers will press three buttons at same time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you don't want it too small .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how large they have thick fingers .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if you wanna make it in international , japanese people got rather small hands and we got these large zoom opt , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "true , but , we have the zoom option , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can make it larger to with accompanying greater fields to push the button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we won't include pen , to point , we want to do it with our fingers , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "your fingers , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you don't want because if you lose the pen if you lose the pen you can't use you can do whatever any cloth .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you could include pen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "use pen you can lose the pen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but people want to use remote with their fingers because they're used to that and we have to add tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the fingers , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if they t's handy to use pen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is good size for the screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how large the actual remote should be but little bit like this , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that can be with plain soft tissue .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can buy those at it's better to include rechargeable batteries which you can recharge through the docking station .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if interrupt you , should show some points on which we should take decision .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can discuss these points .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "those points energy question mark .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how should we supply the thing with energy and how are we going to do it with separate docking station and then put in it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "chip on print and case .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "those are points my coach advised me to discuss here , but hope you have ideas about them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "energy were batteries and then and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the docking station .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's the first point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we already decided that on the previous meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if the badg the batteries are dead then you can re you can change them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just like with the telephone .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "kinda like your you got some of those wireless mice ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "kinda like those batteries .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it should be normal batteries , not like two or two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "normal plain you no normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "simple rechargeable batteries .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what was with the chip on print ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the chip on print ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "chip on print with simple sim not simple but we also discussed that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but how did this how does that with screen ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you still have print plate .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "beg your pardon ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you always have print plate .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you always have print plate , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "always , so what we have to decide about that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "t's good question .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it just was in there and didn't have any information about it , but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "chip on print , what they mean with the regular rubber buttons that you got , it's always clear for the remote control when you press certain button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but when you got screen , with no with not the buttons are not always on the same place , if you enlarge button , or if you got several options appearing on your screen , the co-ordinations aren't always the same .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , but the print plate of l_ screen is more advanced than normal print plate , so that that's not of any discussion , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "when you got regular button , the button of stand-by is always on the same place and you got on the and on the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you need some c_p_u_ , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't think that's but if nor it's quite simple .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it is simple c_p_u_ but it doesn't because it has to but it the remote control has to know whether you're in settings menu or just you just want to turn up the volume .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's quite simple screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they don't need that big of c_p_u_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it has to have some calculation unit or c_p_u_ to know in which state you are and which button you are pressing in at the moment .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because we're projecting the buttons on the screen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and touch screen makes it possible to get the co-ordination of your finger on the screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the case , we already discussed the case , we wanted to make it from rubber and hard rubber .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but hard rubber like this ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or softer rubber or .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the easy to ha to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it bounces back from the floor where you throw it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have different colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this in different colours ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and round shapes ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's our main target .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no don't think , it's more round than square .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it should be bit longer , perhaps .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it meets more the young people than the older people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that's what we want , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's our target .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "lower than forty years , it was .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and how about my idea of making it with one single curve ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that was quite good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so because it's gadget and you want to show it off , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have fancy design , then , away .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can put it on your table with the screen , you don't have to put it get it in your hand , you can put it next to you and then dive it in and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so but wrote it down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's good idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's lot easier .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you can't , you can draw it on your paper and then load it on the and load it on the user the server .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , so you got did you write that down ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then , you can it's pretty easy but and , had what should again .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "got single curved rubber fancy coloured remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what about the user interface , there are also some questions about the concepts you have some ideas on that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you showed your drawing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "miss few buttons , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "at least what we should also have on , remembered , menu to go back through the first if you touch options , you can't go back to this away now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have to go back .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "with the minus and the plus .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's easier than .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it was easier to handle this way , but what they think .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would you like the buttons horizontal or vertical ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for sound and channel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "depends on the screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we make it like this , if you put it like this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you make it in rectangle so it's square .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's easier to have it something like button minus here , plus over here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "minus here , plus over here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and on here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the other buttons and on here the top .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the options and then you have something like the p_ over here , and the sound .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but wou that's matter of what you're used to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "something like sh plus minus .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would put plus and min here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then the p_ in the mid in the middle and the sound in the middle .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "take your time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but when you are holding it , you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you're going to you're going to use it with one thumb .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "perhaps have some examples .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we'll leave that to the usability engineering then .", "speaker": "C"},

how much not how often it's used , but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what's usual or normal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes i'm looking here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but here's it's below ,

the concepts .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it is user interface .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this concept is in the actual design , but you should know where you would place and the speech shall we implement that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we just heard about the new technology , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's easy for that , where are you , but then it says i'm here .", "speaker":

can talk into the corner .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not even necessary , because lotta you can make very sensitive microphone , so it makes it possible to just put it arou underneath it or on the

control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "between the round of the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so where do you want to put it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "where the one hand but are we talking about the button , or about the microphone ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually it does because it you can find it better if you use it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "bu but the left under corner should be the best .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's way for you to so it makes more sense just 'cause other remotes don't have that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "about microphone , there is no button .",

isn't it isn't most in sight .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "put it there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that doesn't really matter .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so type , supplements , anything .",

the scroll .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you do like it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so why not , on side .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or at least if it's really the scroll , but the menu they

if you yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "becau the scroll's easier if you have lot of options , but if you don't have lot of option then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you have lot of options , because when you use you get when you use the settings menu to look up some channels on your television , you should scroll down on menu which probably does not fit on your screen .", "speaker": "C"},

, colours are clear , shape is clear , material is clear .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "everybody think they can work for that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what's the standard colour ?", "speaker":
