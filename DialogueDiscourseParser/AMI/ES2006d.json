[{"edus": [{"text": "i'm proud of it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll take minutes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it does look very .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then need to say some st few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then we'll be making that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from cat and the financial limits .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then we will have brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we've got forty minutes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then do we get to make remote control ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause we missed out .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's now that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we've got until four fifteen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how much do we have , forty minutes ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "about four fifteen , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "until about four fifteen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "go for it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you want yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , you said are we starting with the so will you start with like the shape and things and then will explain the user interface things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and , but it's just an approximation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you think bananas are safe thing to use ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's bit phallic .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "dual use , perfect .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "dual use , perfect .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "your remote control ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's just bad .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "does it vibrate when you press the buttons ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's the flip open thing again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so now we have the , so ma maarika will explain you the user interface there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it flips open on the side , so it opens like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we have the user interface in here and the scroll are inside .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "everything else is probably user interface , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it's the whole thing's made of rubber , is that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it has , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it to scale , or do you think you can make it bit smaller ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it could be made bit smaller , and it would be and , but one thing we actually forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , so we said the back side round , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", but since it's made of rubber anyway .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it does look like the curvy and then the whole shape's curvy , so would say that this curvy does look quite like vegetable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it's spongy as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "wasn't very keen on that , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the user interface as we discussed last time on the cover we just have the very basic things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we have that channels here starting from one two three there would be numbers in the on the actual one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , zero here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "six seven eight nine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then , this is on off button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's quite standard place for it and also the colour is quite often red , so it's user friendly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we would also have little thing saying here , previous and ne prevon next .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so where's the volume ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the volume is scrolling .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "on the side , this one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's on the side .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you did get that in then , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you just do it like this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it's on the back is cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the volume is you just scroll , but then once you flip it open , there you have the screen and you have the spinning wheel with options to choose .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can move back and forth and then if you need to choose something on the screen , you just push the cen the middle button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the thing we forgot was like mute button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , we we'd not put so on the cover we have the bare essentials .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll have this on the screen , on the display .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or you could have it so you on the wheel if you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "on the we , the main menu will have various options .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the mute , the scrolling is you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but if you hold it in , if it's scroll and click so you hold it in ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it's scroll and click , isn't it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that solves the whole mute issue .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and , so the voice recognition is also just part of it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can't really see it in the interface .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's hidden in there somewhere .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we do have the logo on it as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it's with the black and yellow you're even in the colours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we could do the logo in grey , as it is on the website .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we ran out of resources here , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in the actual one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if you have questions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can have look .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "very good , let's have look .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "test it out .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's intermediate colour , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", we hold the remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it does feel all cold and slimy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "hate play-do , it's just minging .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , that's , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if we go on to evaluation cri criteria and then we'll there suspect we're gonna have couple of minor finance issues , but we'll se i'm we can get around them somehow .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "see the budget .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll just send all of our manufacturing to some poor country and cut some of the prices that way .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what we're gonna do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we're gonna be using seven point scale , so one is , yes , it meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what did was went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made list of them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that we can evaluate each one and like so it was about going back to the start and saying , we did manage to do that , or no , we really forgot about that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so these are what they are .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , did have , c_ , and d_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so for each of these we need to give it one to seven .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "dots , never mind .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if you can imagine that they say , c_ , and d_ , then that would be really good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we'll give it maximum points in everything .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the , it's definitely attractive .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the locatable thing we actually forgot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we'd kinda said that you'd have little thing to stick on the t_v_ ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just prepare one now .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "shall prepare it now ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it will be red , too .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , be attractive to look at .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's this one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what do you all say ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "seven was the maximum , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "go for seven .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "seven , it's terribly sexy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we're all so proud of the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that'll be seven for .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "could no , you can't whilst that's up there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what i've done on the next page is i've set it up so we just put the marks in .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "except we can't we can if we then , i'll take note , it's fine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that's alright .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we can take note the only thing that we were considering was that this thing is more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , so if you're left-handed you're left scrolling with your finger .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you take note of them , and then i'll put them in minute .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we're all agreeing on seven for ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "does it match the operating behaviour of the user ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would think yes , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we might do we might want to do like another model another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that's gonna be problem , 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in family .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so bu it's not huge problem , because it is operatable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not like it's pen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but then left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway , so they just .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but because it's not like it's pen , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , but they can normally do most things right-handed , so would say it's not such big issue .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it , so if the majority are right-handed , it's or six , because it's just one among the issues , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can use your finger to scroll rather than your thumb .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that does negate the whole r_s_i_ issue .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we need to put that needs little bit of investigation , give it five , would say ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what do you what do you all think ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for most people are right-handed , so in terms of our greatest target group , it's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want might want to they .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one more thing is that it might be little clumsy when it opens up , so it opens on the side .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , but we have it nicely with the hinges here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it won't be problem , it will be and it will be it won't be heavy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you can decide wh whether .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the alternative is flipping from the top .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it's bit long .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we which makes it really big , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the length is gonna be difficu .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's little bit long .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you were thinking about making it smaller , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it can be opened like this and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this makes it more and two , it might interfere with the i_r_ channel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because so you have to keep that side flat .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if we flip it open only as much as that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it works like mobile phone flipping , but , as long as that side's flat , than that will work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "are we admitting defeat on c_ or are we saying we're gonna stick locator on the t_v_ ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , we're gonna put it like we've got there's the locator dot .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , we have locator .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that means you need that does mean you need little speaker on it though , doesn't it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that you stick on t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to make it beep .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the speak sample speaker is included , so it has some capacity to do some to make some sounds , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's two , so that's seven , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "intuitive , completely intuitive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if this means intuitive , if it means the way people are used to finding things and it's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'd say six , 'cause the standard layout for numbers is three and one , rather than the way you've got it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "really like the way you have it , but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so , should we say five and say it is intuitive , but it's different , so , do , it's obvious how to use it , but you might have to think about it first .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so might be but it and it's something that they will be experiencing in lot of different places soon .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and even the scroll , it's new technology so might be little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni so it is not very intuitive but it's good technology , once they get used to it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we give that one five , you think ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm happy with five ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm gonna give seven in everything , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm glad you're accepting this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it has taken little while , hasn't it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "intuitive but , it's really hard to write on those .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "went bit mad , didn't ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would this comes back from this whole thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but otherwise it's superb .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , should we give it six ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the ergonom ergonomic design , the repetitive stress things , but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the remote control anyway , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "unless you are all the time sitting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's kinda .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'ve banned them from .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it is ergonomic .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "used to send fifty texts day , and never got repetitive strain injury from that , so find it quite hard to believe to be honest .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and moreover it has and everything , so that we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we give that six , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it does have .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "voice control have seven .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "hang on , how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's just , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the second one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , but not on the previous slide .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it has voice control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , so that's seven then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "anyway it ha , it's the most sophisticated remote that ever seen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have the sample speaker as , which is , it's new .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you don't they're never been used they've never been using remote control before don't think .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "all of the components have been used in other things before .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but at the same time they are all they are all relatively new .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but they've been brought together in remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but do , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what do you reckon , five , six ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what do you all think ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how far can you go with remote control , really ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's it , but everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , hasn't it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it still has to do what it has to do .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , don't think many peop that's it , they can take it with them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "put fashion in electronics .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "isn't it fashionable ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the carrot banana remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's the maximum fashion .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , we give it seven , and we write there we go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we've done very , but what's the assessment ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , we need the average here , so we got seven so we've got four sevens , so that's twenty eight , three sixes , eighteen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the average is about six and something .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "little bit over six .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there are how many sixes ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , little bit under six .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one , two , three .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and one five .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "three sixes , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fifty one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "twenty eight , thirty eight , fo forty six .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "forty six and five , fifty one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "six point about six point five .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "fifty one divided by it'll have to for bit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "six point something , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "two three four seven eight .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "six point five , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's pretty good , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's all you've got at the moment , or did you have anything more ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , that's it , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , finance .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we'll see if we can unscrew this first .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is i'm just beautiful .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there we go and there are the marks .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "computer no signal ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and now we have to calculate the production costs .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i've got an excel spreadsheet to help us do that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can you read that ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "more or less .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "started filling it in , but these are provisional , so we have to go down .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no hand dynamo , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one simple battery .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no kinetic energy , no solar .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we also said the sample sensor and sample speaker .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "single-curved surface , so that we can fold it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "case material we said rubber .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what special colour means .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "anything which is not more .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "something coloured , probably .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this is probably special co no ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it could be rub rubber comes coloured , it's would it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or if you want some pattern thing on it , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you might end up having to take off the sample sensor .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we we're definitely going to have to so we've got pushbutton , and then we've scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have pushbuttons , scro we have scroll wheel as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for the muting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", we had , for muting , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no we have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we have l_c_ display and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and button supplements .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but what do we ha we have l_c_ display , but the wh but the spinning wheel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we don't have we're not using any of that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the spinning wheel's not there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have think it's integrated with the l_c_ display ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we've got more than one pushbutton though , haven't we ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause then you have that means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if that's one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not counting anything , we'd still be in budget .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that seems unlikely .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "push what whether pushbutton means that count by button or do we don't think that makes sense .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wh what is the limit ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "twelve point five .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have to count all of them , or .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't , no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "doesn't , but it and l_c_ display .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no it says what is the interface , if it is pushbutton then you got zero point five , it's scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and display , so that's the three interfaces that we have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wh what's our criteria ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this sample sensor .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "our budget's twelve point five .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that has implications though for the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for the locator .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that's bit of gimmick anyway really , isn't it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the locator also goes away .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can afford to get rid of it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it was very no innovative innovativeness .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that means no locator , does it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what else does it need ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the speaker the sample speaker is expensive , but we could just have some very easy device that just beeps .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause the sample speaker was , more complicated then just beeping thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this would be , there you record your samples your speech samples and , then we would be in the budget .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", so we .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also in the case i'm not that you will evaluate this as curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably flat surface rubber .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we need one fifty off .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so tha that mean that we cannot press how do we how do we make selection in the ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see , was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause but that's you would just have to spin it down .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "take it down to just scroll wheel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we could do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if in the we can scroll , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but how do we make selection if we cannot push the button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , you can push this one , but we don't have pushbutton we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can have to scroll it straight roll it straight down for mute .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's point three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no but ha it's the scroll wheel and we were referring to this as scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we can put an additional mute button on the top as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that wouldn't actually cost any more .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the spin wheel though , isn't it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "didn't that come with the l_c_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's with the l_c_ we decided , 'cause it's not on our list .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that comes with the ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the this is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the scroll wheel is on the side .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we're adding costs for , this is good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're point three over .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're point three over at the moment .", "speaker": "C"},
