will try to work them out and give them to you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i've also made notes of the previous meeting and was about to send them you but then had to go to this meeting so you will get them too .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you are the secretary also .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then hope you all have worked out some presentations about you the task given to you in the previous meeting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we will in minute we will start with them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we will see in which order we will handle them of .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then will bring in some new requirements got from the account manager , try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have com some discussion about it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "about the functions and this meeting we should really try to reach decision about the target group and the functionality of the yes who are we going to sell this , the customers , yes .", "speaker":

have presentations ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , don't .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you don't have presentation ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you want table to yes you can just talk about it or you can use the whiteboard if necessary .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "talk about it but have no slides or anything .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'ve just been presented with some research we've done in small focus group so , hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's probably can't email this to you , i've just got web page with some data on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "eighty percent of users would spend more money when remote control would look fancy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "seventy five percent of users said they zap lot , so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , so they've got remote control with lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use small part of that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you have this information on the web page you said ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have an web page yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , mayb you can send an email to me later .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so there's breakdown of how much they use the different functions on rem remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "power and volume selection are only used few times within this per hour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "channel selection is used hundred and sixty eight times and then there's things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "teletext is used fourteen times in the hour , so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "an interesting thing that this report has brought up is that fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost lot of the time in the room , so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to lot of users .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , have that too .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use remote control , they want something that's easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's easy to learn or how do you say it's too much time to learn .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use new one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not enough you cannot put this webpage online on the it's it it's webpage on the c_ it's file .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and thirty twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for r_s_i_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how we'd go about combating that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what do you mean there ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "respet repetitive strain injury .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they think that or do their doctor the doctor says ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it's the opinion of the users ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's what the report says .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then it's got demographic breakdown on should be able to actually , if email it to you now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can disconnect it there no ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can just .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then you can connect this one or this one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can connect this one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "all to your computer .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so these are important numbers that matthew and need to take into account for our functional these numbers have to be have to be taken into account for the both user interface and functional design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "need to muck around with this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's probably easier if you put it on yours and then i'll just email it to you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's just web link .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one thing it goes on to talk about , which is interesting , is the hang on minute .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because if there are many numbers and we need to select to constraint our design based on what is more important .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one thing is interesting is talking about speech recognition in remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "speech recognition in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you have numbers on that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , i'll just get this up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that we don't do we not need any button on the remote control it would be all based on speech .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "potentially , even for interesti that would not work so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you wanna have both options .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would it would be solution for when your remote control is lost , when it has speech recognition then it doesn't matter where it is , my t's we should be in range , or it can respond and produce sound , so say where it is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the these are all quite fancy features i'm not whether we will we can make this for twelve euro fi and fifty cents .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would be no you can't .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we where the state of the art of speech recognition is , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it depends like there is it's very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off , one , two , twenty three , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it's quite noisy if there is the t_v_ shouting .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's going to be li it's not going to be so easy but usually it's going to be more of an isolated case but it's but with twenty fi it's decline .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , that that's .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you have some more important facts or can we go to the next presentation ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is now talking about who would pay for speech recognition in remote control , who would pay more for it , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you had to summarise the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , it goes down from there , seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five , twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we sh , it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product , which we'll be talking about later .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "decline with age , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we will talk about it later .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "did you get the email ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just follow that link .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "thi you us .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it'll be in different window , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's left that one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's the figure that was just talking about there , with the different demographics .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "another thing it's talking about there is the screen but there's no figures on that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "mael can you give your presentation ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "stay move as far as take your chair ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is , you can move , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now you can move .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can sa take my chair .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's channel selection , module , this and this function , go to the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so as everybody knows i'm the industrial designer .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and in this presentation this group presentation is gonna focus on the working design of the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'd like first to give quick very simple introduction , how does it work , so that everybody knows even if you don't have very technical background what is it because in the product it is important .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the basic function of remote control is to send messages to another system that is fixed .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , that can compose messages , usually through infrared bit and the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages , alright .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so my method for designing the work design first the main point is that would wish to make really functional product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would prefer to have very functional capabilities rather than fancy that is not used and doesn't work .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so for that as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the marketing expert anna and to we should agree on what are the technical functions for this remote control and show you the working design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so here is really large view of what we want .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we want an on off button , it can be it's simple but it's important , and also the to both channels as other buttons that come after , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the components quickly draw here , is that in this part you have the remote control the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's my method is will be to my aim would be to design the and choose the chips and the infrared components to build the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we need energy sources and the receiver .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is very quick design , you stop me or interrupt me if you don't agree on it on that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so what have found and after lot of work actually draw this draw for you this schema that can be too technical for you but is very important for me .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you drew it long time ago ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's it so won't go into details about that but these are my preferences to use that components .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and why do you want these component ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "are they cheap , or are they reliable ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what were your .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the main components you see here are the cheapest have found and you have always compromise with reliability and if it's expensive , but this one was not this one also really reliable so that's it for the working design , hope you get clearer view on what remote control is in terms of technical components but no we will this is preference but we can always change .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it it's more clear now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but is it can you just buy it on the market and plug it in or you want to ma to du it's just you had to change the frequencies .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what was thinking about the schema about the sender and the receiver , can you get back to it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the receiver is already in the television and we are not able to change it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we must adapt to the receiver .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "suppose there is standard way of communicating to televisions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we will use infrared protocol using infrared and we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists and but we what we can do is adapting the chips inside to the best chips and infrared bubbles .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in the chip you have it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you should be careful , people are sometime becoming problem , like guy has recently designed remote which could switch off any other t_v_s , so through all the things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that can control other things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we should think of .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should take that into account in the yes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes feel mael will consider this these things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if the t_v_ in the next apartment's really loud , you can just turn it off .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's t_v_ and you can just walk away you don't have to be near the t_v_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like that idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can go to your presentation matthew .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "assume you were finished here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so take mine now there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "take mine it's , voila , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "know where it is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's on the desktop .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i'm going to talk little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do , my last presented what is going inside , so what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the approach is that the idea is to send message to the t_v_ set , as mael has pointed , and it will be decoded by the t_v_ and usually we it is easier to have keys or buttons with which people can press and then changing button will change the message which is being sent to the t_v_ and it sends an internal signal and decoded by the receiver .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so as anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to press the keys , people are can have speech recognition but this is question which will we have to see later .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone , and it sends message to the t_v_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so generally don't have some figures but so there are two kinds of remote if you popularly in the household , actually so you have standard t_v_ remote where you have just on , off button and play , volume change and keys for the number and more than one digit option .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if you see righ now even the one on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine , but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows , but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then there is this is the standard one with without any fancy thing like it doesn't have teletext option , it can without any , it's very simple thing , which you can vouch .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then you have what's the video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and , but it then it has other options like stop and then you play the movie or fo fast forward the movie like that so it has those so these are the standard commonly found remote controls in the market .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then whi which is generally used by the people .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then personal preferences would think of having aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the t_v_ and the remote video remote control because some of the keys in the video's remote control and the t_v_ they could be integrated together so that we could aim for the like in the coming future that type of applications with .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how would that work ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you've got say v_c_r_ and t_v_ which are separate , so you on my one at home i've got v_c_r_ remote which then changes the channel on the v_c_r_ and doesn't do anything on the t_v_ , so is it gonna be like switch on the remote that says use the t_v_ or use the v_c_r_ ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or does it know which one you want to use ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually you could think of having you can have key which could tell it could go to the video thing but yo you still can't in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the v_c_r_ option and you could play it or you can also think about having like in few days you will be ha in few ye coming years you might even have system where you have separate sitting setup box and you have something like you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you and you can just when you come back you could just switch on that thing and watch program .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in that case you want to browse faster , browse slow , you want to have those functionalities .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "these are next generation functionalities .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's the next generation thing , but it is going to come in couple of years .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , but it's already there , the hard disk recorders i've seen them in the shop .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's goi it's .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's going to record your things and you need the functionalities what you need in both video as in the standard t_v_ thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's fair enough .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but don't think we're trying to make universal remote here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no we are not making universal remote , we are just looking at giving scenario , have t_v_ and tomorrow am going to have set up box which is going to sit there and it's going to do that job for me .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we need to decide on in how far we go to in this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "mean , you can go pretty far with functions and possible future prospects yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that ends my presentation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it's good to keep in mind .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we can always discuss about it the presently the video market actually this demand , video over-demand or what we call it as , it's presently booming up actually so it like people are providing like things like movies , you can select actually so you want to watch movie and your provider gives list of movies , and then you select those list .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it you go off , it downloads the movie , it gives for you and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your t_v_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and thi this is going to come .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or even you don't need to download it , it's streamed online .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time want to watch the movie and so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so have received some points of thinking over of my account manager and would like to share them with you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "first thing is teletext is known feature of televisions but it's getting used less and less .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's especially because of the internet .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we should think about it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do we include it , and do we give it prominent place on the remote mot control itself .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as in any case it's not used , very much , but it's it is still used .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "further yes we must think , do we stay to television only , the television as we all with broadcasting signals and you can't go back , or do we go further as matthew indicated by supporting recording devices ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so d_v_d_s and v_c_r_s ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the hard disk recorders .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "furthermore , we need really need to interest younger customers and then with younger customers people below the age of forty , and our current customers are mainly forty plus which forty .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "fourteen or for .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's to that's there's market but they will grow older and you'll al always need to have the future with younger people .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "therefore , younger people like trendy designs , so that's we should make our r_c_ as trendy as possible but it should also be have reliable image , so when it looks too spacey or too fancy people will think does it work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys , now if you take it you have like zero , one , two , three like keys separately , but suppose if you take the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys you press on the top , it takes one number , you press on the bottom it takes another number , and so the space covered so that you don't see two separate keys there actually so it is like it is like so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ma you can draw it on the board .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting , especially if we're going after younger market , that's the new and the funky things , that's , there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones , not too many pretty remote controls .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes mo yes it's recognisable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because they are already used to that , product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and they are skilled by using it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , it works .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , you have presently keys like one , two , three like this , actually , and four five six like that and you can have keys like this in form like keys like that forty minutes ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "mael can you hand me over this ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how much longer have we got for the meeting by the way ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "fi five min .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause we haven't talked about demographic and it's very important issue .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you can have keys like which are like so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "too , so we don't change the original order of them but then the keys are more spacious , they don't look so there is very sligh thing , so if you press on the top it takes the one , it takes the three , four here five and six , so the keys can be it looks not very much cluttered but it looks for you don't have too many keys but you can have lot of options if you press on the to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now that the idea's clear .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we should now try to decide on our target group .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is quite tricky .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're trying to get people to buy remote control wouldn't they already have remote control with their television when they buy one ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they have already one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so our remote control has to be better .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it's not going to have more functionality , 'cause it's only low market , it's cheap-end remote control , we can't beat modern functionality , we might we'll be able to beat them on the look of it , the design of it but that's not big seller , if they're not just going to buy new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty , they have to actually need it as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'm not how we can get people to buy this thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "many people said in your research the appearance of the r_c_ is important when they are buying one but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but why are they buying one in the first place ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that will be about functionality .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if people are buying new remote control for functionality they'll buy universal remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i've got friends who've got so many things they need universal remote , otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in that case they wouldn't buy our product , because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so your you think we should go for more universal high-performance what do you think about what componen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can't , with the price range .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we we're not building universal remote , we're not building high end product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have twelve point five euros per r_c_ and with this now that chips are very cheaps and we can include it in our control some new features .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and but that's ye don't think is not necessary , for long term .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we're getting into universal remote territory , we're getting to screens and things like that which would drive the cost up lot .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "whether that's necessary .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is the screen thi this could be this could be market because universal remote controls tend to be quite expensive .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for universal remotes if you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and quite complicated to use , yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can try to go in between , and offer product which is not as expensive and not as complicated but still people have the idea this is more functional than normal r_c_ because it has more it is in some kind universal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not as flexible , but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own t_v_s to use remote control on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes but we're targeting on more on the twenty to forty group .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "who just have or already have job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on universal control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "really what the price range for remote controls is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range , or are we middle to bottom ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when we over thi we are trying to offer the universal control for less money .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so do you agree ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's fine with me like the price as long as it is not too expensive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because we have to take into account that we are gonna we are gonna sell four aro around four million so when we speak about these numbers the price of chip is price of chip is very cheap .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it our provin .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i'm for designing ne less universal r_c_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you t's possible for the twelve euro fifty ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so then we decide on going to this more universal control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's what we needed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's needed now .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you can look to the standards of other actu .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's needed , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if we want to get the market , we really need that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what i'd like from universal remote is choosing between three devices , being able to switch between them , there may be stereo , v_c_r_ and t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and just be able to use them all from the same remote , but not at the same time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can also browse through all the standards , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is that for you ?",
