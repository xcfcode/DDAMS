.", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "who's gonna give the prototype presentation ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've made prototype .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we've got our aspects from the last meeting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "especially we looked at the form , material and the colour .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we've drawn here the prototype .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the logo is pretty obvious to see on the remote control , but it is necessary when you want to build your company to level higher .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "our interface elements , there are shown in the drawing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can point them the functions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the all the functions are discussed the most of the functions are obvious .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's little bit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then the nine channels .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the volume at the side , and the other side is the programmes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then we had just two buttons , we place them in the middle , the menu , and for the teletext that was , the mute button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , the mute button misses now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you did we want to have mute button ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that it's here then , in the middle .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "alright , and you gotta point out which is the volume button and which is the programme button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , we've disc most of the users yes , there will be little p_ on that and little .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "mo , most of them are right-handed .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you gotta make it clear on the on , and triangle on that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't have time in anymore on the , just progr programme above , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "next to that kinda miss zero actually .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there's was one thing wanted to ask .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there are different ways for remote controls to do like call it teens and twenties .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the two numbers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "all no , that's kinda dependent on the television .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but do we have do we need extra buttons , some have to , but you don't actually need them , becau lot of remote controls work that when that you when you fir you push the one first , then you have couple of seconds no , don't .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you should add cross , or whatever .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , you have lot of standard buttons that has to be on it , with the one and double yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then second .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , that's dependent on the television .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , you have televisions , then you have to , you have to press yes , but lot yes , but some televisions don't accept that no , but yes , but some old televisions you have to click on special button , then you go to next level , you can push two buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do know so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is it depending on television ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "nah , don't really , because you have know some remote controls that don't have these buttons , but you still can , know , you can still select the twenty number in the twenty or in the ten .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , but no remote control nowadays are they come with the television .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or actually , the other way around .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , really t's because you can when you put button on it with like one and then dash , it's the same thing as when you just push the one , because it first gives you the functionality of that separate button you also had to apply .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but su if no .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because that's it's for television .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's exact the same thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so some television respond differently .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "look , if yes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , listen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when you push the button , the remote control gives signal .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in the first place it gives signal which it would also send when you put separate button on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , that's true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the one with dash , that signal gi and when whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives signal for channel one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , it works if you haven't got special button for it , if you push one , then on your television there will appear one and line , which is an empty space .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it works that way , really .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it's exact the same that would appear when you put separate button push separate button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you don't underst you don't understand my point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's exact the same thing when no , but then they would also support that button , because it's the same thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you want yes , but some television don't support it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the ex .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "listen , with that that's that special but button you're talking about , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's just signal to recei ju they send signal to the tv t_v_ that they have to put one in on your screen and dash , which you can pu so you can still put another number on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when you don't have that separate button , and you push one , it's exactly the same thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , some televisions need the input first and you no , that's not true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , remote can yes , so they need no , they need no , but , it and the button for the scart audio video external input .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you give the input .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you push the one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's the same thing as the button with the one and it yes it is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's simply not true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "think about it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's simply not true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly one and just dash , and then two seconds we'll discuss them in the usability lab .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , remote control doesn't give signal after five seconds .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it's the same thing what happens and remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "remote control is stupid thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you push button , it sends it immediately to the television .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's know for that some televisions that the remote control supplied , only ha has the these buttons with one and dash and two and dash , but when you use bu remote control that doesn't sport these buttons , it still works .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , we we'll impl no , we'll apply them then for now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , definitely not .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it's necessary .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for now , if we for whether but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can access that via zero , and then minus , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what said about the remote control sending another signal , that might not be true , but still it all t_v_s in some ways support it , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , no .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's more is we don't we both don't really understand how it really works , but there's more to in than wha than what you just said .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "remote control sends one signal at one button press .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do think that t_v_s support mur multiple remote controls .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "some televisions when you want to go further than ten no , you have to you have to give the television two or more signals .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "won't work wi with to have that special button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when you press one button , you give one signal .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the older televisions need more signals to go level higher .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but when you make the technology that it will give more signals , it could work , but just basic idea of the most common and simple operations on the remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "kinda miss the docking station .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's here on the we came yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's nothing it's pretty basic , the there's no fu there's one button , that's wha there's one function and that's the one button when you want to find it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no nothing really trendy about it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we can make the docking station bit standard for the other products we sell , because real reaction sells more products than only remote controls .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we can use the docking station , m_p_ three players or hearing devices .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's very difficult , because of different shapes of devices .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , but when you put that same volt voltages on it , you can put when the lowest part of it , when it's the same as the other products , you can put it all on the same yes , but we can make no , we can make the most lowest part all the same .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it got it has got to fit into the shape , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the technology and the voltage can be the same .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but if you all make the having bottom like this , then they all fit .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's true , but yes , but shouldn't it fall then ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "when the recharger has bit what points out , we can place all on top of it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just have to be big enough for the biggest no , when you make it large enough no it will not .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it isn't going to fall down ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's bit , no , but if like this , i'll point it out , if you got base like this , won't draw it really .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but then it's little bit but it's just an idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you got base which is as big as this , but if you got if you got tiny player , it can .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's flat as this , so we can make all the products as flat as this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it's backwards .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , but when you make bit of big yes , little holer littler , little products go deeper in it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it's backwards .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's leaning backwards , in the docking station .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wha what you could do if you from the bottom , help .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but let's ha let's talk about the docking station later , because we have to consider the docking station anyway , because we have some cost issues still to come .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you could make like hole in it , of in the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that is possible , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the look and feel would be on this remote control , because you always will pick up the remote control in the smallest area .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we have to look .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't like the colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then your left thumb of your thumb is near the programme button , which is the most common used function , and all the other buttons are available for your thumb .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's really good design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , on the side there will be strip of rubber , and in the middle there is hard material , bit hard plastic with light behind it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and other lights ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "added lights are gonna be problem too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , we can make also neon lights on it , or the buttons that can make light on it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , on the front .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , it will also use batteries , and do we want to the all the aspects of the interface buttons were yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for now , this is good enough .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what was on the , but in the , the colour , because we're gonna use one colour for the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber , isn't it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we're gonna do the buttons in the are we're gonna have rubber buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and they're be they'll be in the same colour as the rubber on the side .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in the same colour as the side .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that'll be good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we should use darker colour for the plastic , and some more brighter and flashy , we'll talk about the lights later .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , we can use on the lights on the side we can use multiple lights , so it will yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause also don , it's depends on the costs and such .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , and we have to agree upon the exact colours , but may if that's important , but we'll talk about that later .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for now this is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the next you gonna give presentation too ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have to see the agenda .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", i'm gonna do something there , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we gotta do that on the most right-most screen , because the leftmost , that's me .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "will be needing that image , so leave it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're gonna evaluate that design according to few points .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we the four of us are going to do that together .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "wanna have colour over here , come on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the remote is not ugly , bit weird sentence , but the positive things has to be on the left , so said not ugly instead of ugly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what would you say , we gotta give points to all of these to evaluate that design , and forget the drawing skills of these .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the remote control is not ugly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how do you feel ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "four would be appropriate , because it's , it really depends on taste .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's , our design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's so if lot of people find it really ugly , other people find it really .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or how you casting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how do you feel ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the fronts will give it more less uglier side , because you can make it in your own yes , you can make it in your own more to your own personality or house style .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the different designs .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we didn't we're not planning to use fronts , believe .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , not fronts , but different designs .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "with colour co colours .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , not fronts .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that's still , is little personal touch , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "different colours , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , we should do three that , our .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wha what would you think ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can make it one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , but what is it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "two or three .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "two or three .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "go for the positive .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was thinking about three , so three is bit , what am doing ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so go for two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was thinking about four , so three is , let that let's make that one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll mark it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the remote control's that makes zapping easy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "antek , you agree ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's one thing for .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you're not antek .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm the usability , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the remote control the remote control's relevant buttons are prominently visible .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "two or one , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the , menu , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's something we really put work into .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would say one because every button is relevant .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's all about the buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and our , it's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we succeeded there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but two , because of the menu button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and telete , we if the they're necessary .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also , the buttons of the one , the two , the digits , they're used can yes , three , two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the , you you've got point .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "came long way , but not we didn't not no , it can also always be more simplistic , but two is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "two or three ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you can't make remote control without them , because yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because we got .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "nay that that's true , that's true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they're definitely needed .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we put it on two ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the remote control has got really trendy look .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's hard to say from this picture .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we we've tried to make it the best trendy look ever .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but do t's more but do think that it's more trendy than beautiful .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "will make it three , because .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it has to score higher on this than on the three .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was planning to give it two , where give the not ugly , that's true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you agree on the two ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "when you compare to the what's the difference with .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "copied that one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "remote control has got innovative technology implanted .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're not , the on the side .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , not , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we you mean the rubber ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the light .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we have to talk about the lights .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the light .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that that's not innovative .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , six .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and don't also it's also really not innovative , it's more no , six .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not seven ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "lights are six .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or seven , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , six .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "why not seven ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "mine is seven .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because we've tried to make it little bit innovative , but it with the lights it it's future but still you can retrieve it when it's gone , with the with yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's depends on the no , actually it's seven , but there's nothing innovative about it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you think the lights are innovative ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "agree , but i'll , you didn't draw the docking station .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "innovative in generally or just original for docking station is innova .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it it's with its more that that's no , the agenda says evaluate now , so we it's six .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the docking station is little bit innovative .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the dock station , but , the docking station , it's gonna be problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's part of the remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and with the speaker on the there's also speaker .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , let's leave it open for us later to see what , because we have to reevaluate anyway .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for now it's six or seven , sev six , because , but don't if it's very inno .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the retrieval or the yes , how would you innovate remote control more ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that , for the retrieval function .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's very innovative for remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", more through like function t_v_ functionalities and no , what .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to put it on your head .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have must be innovative technology for remote controls , but more in how you control , not in how you find your .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but definitely don't t's five , but remote control is easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's that's think about it la later on and , as one or two ma at least .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the remote control hasn't got .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , would have seen that one before .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you skipped one , here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i've just filled go away .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you like the buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "found twelve questions so much , but it still is ten .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "remote control will be bought by .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it will be bought by people under the age of forty .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in and comparing with people of the age above ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just in general .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , just if they buy it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but yes , two , but only in when you compare it with elderly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what do you think ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that is not the question .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , that's no comparison .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's just it will be bought by people under forty .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can , you can be very picky about it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and don't mean two people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is just guessing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just make it we'll make it two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "make it two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the rem the remote control has recognisable corporate image , colour , logo or slogan .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "when it succeeds , it can get two , mu logo .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have make an slogan is quite obvious .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we don't have the slogan though .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the , no , not the slogan .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can we see the slogan ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can put that on the side if we would like to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , encrypted with yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and will still t's gonna be two or three .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are we gonna do that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "three this time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because of the slogan remote control's got basic design intended for novice users .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , it's one or two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "make it two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we gotta add up the scores now to see our total average .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "four , five , seven , nine .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "fifteen , seventeen , twenty one , twenty four , twenty six .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's two point six .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's not that bad .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright , we .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that's mostly the inno when we score higher on innovative technology , we would score two , which is quite score .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is was the evaluation ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this was my evaluation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because still think that the most important part of this meeting still has .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we did pretty job until now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is this your whatever .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is there something after this meeting ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we gotta fill out another questionnaire .", "speaker": "D"},

gonna open the spreadsheet and we're gonna work this out together , because didn't really fin have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "didn't really finish it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we we'll see .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll stumble upon some problems .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we probably will .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "probably have already opened it here .", "speaker": "A"},

know how many simple chips , regular chips .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's one chip , but you have to choose one from it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but where did we find this information ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the simple chip is enough , but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval , it can be no , yes , my the email got said simple chip , but when we put in the speaker
