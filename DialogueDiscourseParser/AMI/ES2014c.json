[{"edus": [{"text": "conceptual design meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so from the last meeting was trying to send you the minutes , but it didn't work out too , so in quick summary of the last meeting , quickly give you what we had .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so wishing hadn't closed the damn so we had the fact that we're gonna have the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the device the remote device .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we had made our decisions about made our decisions about the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're gonna have effectively two pages , front page which had the features that the customers most wanted , and then the backup features on the second page so that it could meet the technical requirements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often , only as and when required .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what decisions have we made ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have there been any changes ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we all have presentation again , so if we go through those and then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "three presentation , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "shall go first again ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , fine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see this little more smoothly than the last one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let's get started .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the for the i'll back actually .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for the components design , next step is the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then there is chip and still the sender .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so yes including the power supply as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll go on to my findings in each of these areas .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "any of you think of like the old torches which you wind up .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's kinetic option , which if any of you've seen those new watches which you power up by waving around , it just requires small amount of movement which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's one option , but that was gonna cost little more .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then there's solar cells .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as final option .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for the buttons , we have an integrated push button , which is just to say all these are supplied by real reaction .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so for the buttons there's an integrated push button , which is just the same as the standard ones .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this says it's similar to the button on the mouse for normal for like modern computer .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's scroll wheel which is the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down , which may be for the volume .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you could do that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one issue for the buttons is , depending on which material we use , if we use rubber buttons then it requires rubber case , so we have to take that into consideration .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "moving on to the printed that's on the next the there wasn't too much difference in the cost , that related to the actual buttons , but it does affect the printed circuit board .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what would be the cost do we know ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which is the next section .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for the circuit board which is the middle , it's just see it down there the chips like the workings of the actual of the remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the firm supplies simple , regular and an advanced circuit board .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and there's different prices according to each .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had standard push button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's small unit available through the company which would be an extra cost , but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote too much .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that would require more advanced circuit board , so there is an extra price in that sense .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there is an extra cost in that sense .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "going to my personal preferences , possibly for power we could use kinetic which is the idea of the watches that you move the remote around to power it up .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for the buttons , we'd probably get away with just having the standard push buttons rather than the scroll wheel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , then we'd have to get more costly circuit board .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that's it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "with the printed circuit boards you were going for the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it depends if we're gonna have the speech recognition , we'd have to probably get an advanced one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , so that is something i'll have to look into .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but are we going .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's decision for all of us .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so are we able to make that decision now in sense that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue , so would it not be best to rather than one way is to do each of the presentations and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the other way would be to do the presentation and then make the decision at that point in time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's probably better one , to discuss it straight away .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause at that point then you've got the details up there , so if we wanted to know that the scroll wheel required the regular and what required advance .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time and then that would be the end of that issue .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does that make sense ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have lot of the information there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it might not be very clear .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "unless you want to plug it back in to yours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we could do , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as say it only specified that we need more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel , it didn't the voice recognition came as separate piece of information .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no the scroll wheel required the regular , so the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you down .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's just this bit at the bottom which i've highlighted , but the scroll wheel requires mini minimally regular chip , which is in the higher price range .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the scroll wheel , and if we're going for sleek and sexy , scroll wheel is bit kinda bulky ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the display requires an advanced chip the display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expense .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also the display's else which we decided against .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that bit and note that the push button just requires simple chip , so that would keep the price down .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i've got pictures 've seen pictures with it sticking off the side of it , and they don't really look .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so just simple push button , and that would cut costs on the did everyone get this on the speech recognition ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we're going for .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so is simple push button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so are we going for the are we going for the simple one , are we ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the it was what we said before , the idea that you record in set message , and then it picks up that message and replies to you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it is the concept we discussed before .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but then we for whether it would require more complicated circuit board .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm guessing it would , but got like the definite information .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we should go on what we're certain of rather than if it's just the push button then it just needs the simple circuit board .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if we go for the simple push button , so effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or are we going for the regular ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but is there any other , that's true for the for that element , but we have to take all el elements into consideration .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one , or say the regular one , or the more advanced , then that would have to be the same for all of them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "suppose we need to find out what circuit board that requires , before we make decision .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the way that interpret that it doesn't seem to send out signal to the telly , it just it's like parrot just rep reply replying to your message .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "suppose so , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that would be something separate , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so don't would effect our circuit board .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we'd have simple circuit board and that would be an extra that would be in addition to it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that makes sense .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause the example that they've given there is good morning coffee machine , good morning jo .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it might be useful to say like where are you remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "here am , jo .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that's as far as that one could go ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that makes sense , so we'd stick with the simple circuit board and then think of the speech recognition as an extra possibility .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just as fun way to find it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "simple circuit board .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "simple push button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it says that it said the cost of that isn't too much .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you were wanting to go for the kinetic power supply .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so just for ease of not having to replace the batteries .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and how does it get charged up ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's it works on the basis they have some ball bearings inside .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's some on watches which you shake to power it up .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you'd move the remote around little bit and then that powers it up to use it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the speech recognition was are we going for speech recognition ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause that required the advanced had speech recognition requires advanced req require .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it would be helpful to find it , but don't t'd , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just for the call and find thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "did we decide it didn't affect the circuit board , it just affected it was just no that's what , but it doesn't .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "might have got that wrong .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause it's separate isn't it , it's not part of the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "speech recognition you reckon then is simple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's just an addition thing it's .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so we would want it in as an extra because it doesn't appear to cost too much .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would that be , it wouldn't really cost anymore , would it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "shall pass on to you now ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll just check what it said .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "actually don't really says anything about the cost , but it says that it's already in the coffee machines , so like it's already .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "assume it would cost extra , but we we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then have to change all change everything at the last minute .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that was quick .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so very brief presentation , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "from looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute , none of them are particularly sleek and sexy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "haven't actually got the examples of the scroll button there , but there's some curved cases that you can see , range of sizes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "all of them have lot of buttons there they seem to just have the rubber buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "does that move it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it just seems to be skipping on without us doing anything .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i've found that try and get it back .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you click and then go onto previous slide .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there wasn't much more to say about that , just rambling .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "some of the remotes that looked at , one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could where it was connected to the remote control functions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it was quite swish model , where it can control four devices , t_v_ , cable , satellite , video , d_v_d_ , audio .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's bit of competition there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's better not to try and compete with that thing and just to market it as completely different like different viewpoint as finding your lost control rather than trying to compete with the functions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the scroll buttons , as you've already mentioned , there's examples of those , but they don't look as sleek as other models .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and there's no real advantage and because it impacts on other on the materials and the price it's not .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on the price , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you were saying the scroll buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there was specialist type of remote that we could think about , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there was children's remote , where they just had very limited range of buttons and they were bright and colourful and you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if that's really in our field ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that's something that's out there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we're going for the biggest market , not , but was it specified that we went for the biggest ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'re to go for the international market rather than local market but that wouldn't necessarily preclude the one thing that you can often do with products is you can make small modifications .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever , and then you could have additional features in like you'd have model one , model two and model three , and therefore you can sub-divide your market up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that's really where your field is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the children's remote should be like next step , but for ours , we should .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "anyway you could add on for an extra package , but on this basic one i'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's something that we can be aware of .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is that so what are we deciding to do here ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because there's already very good voice recognition technology out there , and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do , it might be good idea to market it as finder function .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the fi , the finder function rather than as speech function to find your remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you also said for going for the international market that some older people might not like the speech recognition .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "different languages might not be compatible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it would make it quite complicated , where ours at least keeps it fairly simple and then the , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause you program this one yourself , like to say like whatever you want to your question .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and ours is quite cheap device , so how much we'll be able to put into it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you'd have finder feature rather than voice recognition feature .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "unless something else comes up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you were talking .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you were talking about scroll buttons ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've decided that it's gonna increase the cost and give no real kinda extra benefit and it's gonna decrease from the sleekness of it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "alright , so we're just gonna have the rubber buttons , was that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and just to be aware that there are specialist functions and specialist remotes but we probably don't want to focus on those like such as the children's remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so not to be focused on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there was mention just as warning about button design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just to avoid ambiguity .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it gave the example of say your volume buttons for up and down , they might both have v_ on for volume , let's think how they did this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "good in flip it round in ninety degree hundred and eighty degrees and have it up and down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm just gonna check so do this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "an upside-down v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that would show that volume was going up , whereas the one underneath would see the volume going down .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what did they say ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the thing was that if you decide to do this , to have triangular buttons , somebody might look at this one and say this triangular button is pointing up , and that's the first thing that they see actually that can't be , can it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , they might see , they might see this pointing down and think that's gonna turn the volume down , whereas the actual button's pointing up , so the function is to turn the button up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , be careful what you put on the buttons and be careful of the shape that you make them , because they might be two contradicting shapes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we could have like .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we could have volume written on the side and then up and down on the buttons themselves .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you could have volume up and volume up , down and like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and 'cause the idea was to have limited it was to have sizable amount of information on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "limited number of buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause it was sixteen buttons , wasn't it that were .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we got it down to not too many .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that's all had to say for that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what was the decision on the design of the volume button ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment , or are we gonna , we should see yours first .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i've been looking at some trends in fashion on top of doing the research into the remote control market the one that's the one talked about last time , that we'd asked people about remote controls and what was good about them , what was bad , what they used .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we've also been looking at fa fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we've had people in paris and milan watching the fashion trends .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the most important thing was that the thing look and felt fancy rather than just functional .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and second , there should be some technological innovation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then third and less important than the other two , there should be an ease of use as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , the fashion trends are that people want clothes and shoes and things with fruit and vegetables theme .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the feel of the material should be spongy , which is contrary to last year , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "presume it must have been not spongy last year .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we need to emphasise the fancy design with on our remote control above all else .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then also try and add in technological informat innovation which could be our find the thing with hand clap .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then we need to ma make it easy to use that's as third priority , so perhaps fewer buttons and functions as we've discussed .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then find way to incorporate these trends so that we capture people's imaginations .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg , or the buttons could be spongy , somehow .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could make them out of rubber rather than hard plastic .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then even wackier than that , we could have fruit or vegetable shaped remote , say in the shape of banana like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that'll be it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "banana or courgette .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how far we actually want to go along and follow the trends , do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget , or , do they not matter that much ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you start making the buttons fruit shaped , it might make it more complicated to use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you were just talking about you've got to be careful how you shape your buttons , 'cause you're can mis-direct people .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and would've thought the functionality 'cause the people get cheesed off by things by having to read instructions et cetera , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just one button , say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that could be little apple .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then that wouldn't get in the way of like kinda one to nine , and it wouldn't confuse the numbers .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people , if you're looking for functionality .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "dunno fruit and vegetables may be popular at the moment , but as we know how fickle the fashion markets are , it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but what are they gonna be next .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what are they gonna be next year .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you can incorporate the tr if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg , next year's was gonna say animals or elephants or whatever .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but suppose as long as it's quite subtle design , even if the design changes , it seems like you're gonna have rubber cases , as buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that means you're constantly changing your production schedule , and you've gotta make different moulds and everything else , so that's not good idea would suggest .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm not what the timescale we're thinking of selling the product over is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to something which is more universal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can imply fruit shape possibly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the spongy feel is something we could think about , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "still with rubber design we could .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was that in the fashion sense that this or was the spongy feel was that fashion ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it was , wasn't it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that you can make them curved or double-curved and that would be the sleek and sexy look .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one of the things were if you had rubber buttons then you had to have rubber case .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that fits , doesn't it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no it's if you use the rubber double curved case then you must use rubber buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the way round .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you have the rubber case then you have to have the rubber buttons to go with it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which makes sense .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "rubber buttons require rubber case .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that would fit in with what we want , wouldn't it , for the spongy feel , to have everything rubber .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the main problem is how frequently do the fashions change ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause in essence in the production you want things to stay you want to mint them out 'cause if you've got fashion changes and that you're incorporating , then it means that your stock is last year's stock and therefore you're selling it or having to sell it at discounted rate which you wouldn't want to do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have difference from year to year , it seems to me that you could incorporate fashion statement if you like , rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you're just changing one aspect like the standby button like that , and especially 'cause then you could make it something that , you might be limited in space , that yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "suppose we are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual would or not .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you two are gonna find that out fairly quickly when you move over to your kit modelling stage as to how much pl how much how pliable is plasticine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could think of the cases like changing with the fashions like the nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but whether that would be too much to incorporate in production , whether that would just increase the costs , make it more complicated .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's possibly it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you're talking there about changing the casing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the actual the look from the outside , so where the buttons would stay the same , and the general function of the remote would stay the same , but you could change the way it looked .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then you could have but you still would have to have the logo on every new case , but you could have like pink cases for girls and red ones and things like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you could do colour change , so therefore you would that's effectively what they did with the mobile phones , was to have some in blue , some in red , some in rather than all in black or , which four do you want , as long as it's black ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but so yes that's true that might no not necessarily , because you could have your company we're meant to be finishing up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it is possibility , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we are supposed to use the company colour scheme , aren't we ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we haven't really seen that yet it might and we might be able to do both but it might clash with certain things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes that is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you could have your company badge and logo .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "lot of computers like on the one you've got there , it actually has stick on badge so what you would al all you would really need , whether it , whether the casing be any colour , could be any colour , but that badge would then have to stick out on top of it so that in sense , with logo like that , because it's on white background , the only colour that it might not stick out so on would be white casing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause you you're badging it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and lot of companies get somebody else to make them and literally just badge them themselves with their own badge over the top .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the way they've got that there even if you had that on white , which is the predominant colour of the windows badge , you'd still be able to see it clearly from white casing product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and whether we'd have big enough market to have this like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's for young people , like the phone generation , that thing'd probably go down , and the market research has been on that side of things , hasn't it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's people say that it's the look , they want the fancy looking thing but i'm .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "with the mobiles , it's the , it's communication device , people see you with it all about and if it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "suppose , where you keep the remote hidden under the sofa most of the time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's in the house , isn't it , suppose .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if we just went for one colour of rubber case did we decide on the rubber case ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so don't change case .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "change case colour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we're saying no to that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the spongy feel , or did we think that might go as trend ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it was different last year .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the trend was different last year .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it was not spongy feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but whether the trend will change .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "whether it's one of those things that like having all fruit shaped keys , that probably would go out of fashion very quickly , whereas just the fact that it was rubber case is probably less of something that you're gonna end up hating in year , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "less likely to so then that would .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you're going for fashion trends like that they'll need you'd have to have interchangeable cases so that you could or 'cause otherwise someone's gonna have to buy complete new remote rather than just case .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it seems to make sense that we we'd just stick with the standard rubber case , and then have the standard rubber buttons as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we haven't really talked about the curvature of the case .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's flat , there's single-curved and there's double-curved .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm not exactly what these things look like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "mayb curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the plasticine .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "says that i'm not exactly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when you say when you say double-curved , what exactly does that mean ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll show you the remotes that i've got .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "see how let's just get that bigger .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "see how the one i'm not plugged in , am ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no you're not connected to me anymore .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that doesn't help .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one thing to cons one thing to consider is that in some ways you want by having fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can if you can store them up on top of each other .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "shall turn it round for time ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that should come up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "whereas if you do fancy things with it , you then gotta put it in ca packaging box that does that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the cost of packaging could be quite important vis-a-vis the total cost of the product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so shall we go through quickly and just work out what we've decide on , if we have to , so shall we quickly we'll go for single curve , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so but no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not very clear up there , but you can see some of them have got bulges , like the second one and the end one where there's curve there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm not exactl if double curve is it comes up slightly , or ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's what was trying to work out .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it is kinda sleeker look if you've got curves in there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so do you wanna go for curves , more curves ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're meant to be we're meant to be finishing this meeting in about minute or so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "definitely single , double .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "shall we go for single curve , just to compromise ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "curved or double curved ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's single curved .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so did we decide on the kinetic power supply ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the one you move around ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that think that's good idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we ca , we'll still have the are we gonna go for the simple circuit board just to keep the cost down ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the rubber push buttons , rubber case .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "rubber buttons and case .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we don't really know much about the colour scheme or logo yet do we , but possibly sticker .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can by not having anything too complicated .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the voice recognition , we can use that can't we , just to find it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "without affecting the circuit board .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and see we could always decide against it if something comes up that's just something to that we seemed to leave out .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then are we going for one button shaped like fruit .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that sounds like it wouldn't do too much harm in couple of years .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what shape do we want ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we've got spongy feel buttons as , have we ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as or was that so it's rubber buttons , so it's not really spongy feel buttons , it's just rubber buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's ru rubber buttons , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it was just .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "with rubber case ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's not too wacky .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "reasonably spongy , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the standby button is gonna be different .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "an apple would be good recognisable shape .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you start getting into kinda aubergines and things , it gets bit weird .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what shape are we making the standby button ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "shall we vote on it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we will go for the apples .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "anyone got any suggestions ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "apple qu quite big one , as .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "could be red apple , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "could be red .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "either , don't mind .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause we wanna incorporate bit of colour if we can , once we find out .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then we're gonna are you gonna work on keeping the button design quite simple ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just like the just working out what we're gonna do for the next time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that seems pretty straight forward .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause most of them will just be mainly circular or like very plain .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what was that last thing again there ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just to keep the shape of the buttons simple .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "much option on that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you were going for single curve and alright .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just the shape of the buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , just keeping the labelling them labelling of them fairly simple as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "fairly self explanatory .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so shape of buttons simple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's that , .", "speaker":
