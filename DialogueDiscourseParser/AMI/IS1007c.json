[{"edus": [{"text": "so we come to the third meetings .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we will talk about some specific details .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so will do my presentation on the components concept so can you open i'm participant two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is what we have decided in the last meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the first thing have done is to made review together with the manufactural department and have which components was available to build remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so for energy sources we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and kinetic technique to store the energy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we also can put regular battery in the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now by battery will not have wire between the remote control and the energy source but didn't fou we didn't decide yet which battery we will put inside the remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if we use battery we will , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's point to discuss .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then the case material we have also several choices , like wood , rubber , titanium or latex .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but t's not re real issue for the from the technical point of view .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "concerning the interface we can put just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and this is the last point , the choice of chips .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what have found is that basic battery or kinetic energy collection is the better way to provide energy because solar energy wi won't work in cluttered environment .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we can start with these two main things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for the case that titanium is good choice because it's trendy and it's t's modern and user are will be very happy to have remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for the interface that we can ach achieve all the desired functionalities by just using rubber buttons , simple buttons and thus this allow to use regular chip that are cheaper .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so we can move to the next slide .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what is this single curved what does it mean ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's the shape of the remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's not yo .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you will have the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when you hold on it , it is comfortable to hold .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's more confog comfortable that if these it's completely flat .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the battery , is it rechargeable or it doesn't matter ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the that's the point .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the kinetic one is you can recharge by the and by just by moving the ar your arm the remote will accumulate energy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that that's what it means by kinetic .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it's if it is feasible because if yet if the user will move enough to provide the remote all the necessary energy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we might check with our and d_ department to see if they have this product ready for market .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and so can you go to the next slide .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so and that's that summarize what have said .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you're we can see in our and d_ if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wha the department .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so keep in touch with the and d_ department .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "take care , it's all .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the titanium case is the normal case that i'll show you some pictures that have and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause am not very , plastic , titanium or whatever .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's another point want to make , is that the you've seen them le na my presentation that point out some why buttons are not the only ways you can use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the user interface is it uses the aspect of computer system , programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you this gives you the ways to input data and we have we are more we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on so you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what's the function of this button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it makes the interface really graphical user interface .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ea easy to use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so next one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so use the button , the mouse .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so next line .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the here are some examples .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so they cluster the buttons together .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they group them into col they colour them and they have different forms as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but this interface are confusing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there are too many buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so some people are propose voice recognition and so by the way receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine for this by company when you tell the you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so got an email saying that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that , supposedly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the next one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so somebody some people use some people use spinning wheel with the l_c_ display so instead of using the buttons you have screen and then there you can use that as buttons , you can use that as real so that could be an option as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "touch screen , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and some people propose scroll button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of just the push button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like the one we have here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so there are few aspects that collected here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this deals with special users , children , handicapped people , old people , and prog they are programmable , specially for children .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then they also secure covers , to protect secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so but we don't have to integrate all these complicated features .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm just saying that the currently in the market there are control there are remote controllers customisable for different people .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's the point .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the next one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you see this is the one where you have the protection cover .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "useful for children , they migh you they only see the buttons outside .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the adults might wanna have key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the next one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this guy this is another company that provides big buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "at see that is useful for old people and then you don't get it lost .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but for our product we don't need big one because you have voice recognition eventually with use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you can call your remote controller if you where it is .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "t_v_ remote controller where are you ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then , he will beeps and to say that am here , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it possible ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we should include speech synthesis in this case , no ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but as norman say if there is already commercial product available who do this we can check to integrate it into our new remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , this is another one where you can the part that's v_ standing for the volume .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so there's up arrow and down arrow .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you the see that in the v_ , the v_ appears to be the down arrow on the top on the top up arrow if you up arrow there's v_ like as if it's turning down so it's confusing interface , so wanna avoid this thing in the design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and here are is here is short summary that compiled after the findings found .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "big buttons are convenient , voice recognition helps , push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and user customisable is important and finally simplicity is the key .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we have many concepts there but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you it's fine you have reviewed all the possibilities but if we consider that the user interface is displayed on the t_v_ screen don't think we nee we need much buttons in the remote since we just have to navigate and to have or enter key or things like that , because adding wheels or scrolls makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or we can include the user manual in the remote control and we should have just button like help and you say and you ik you press the button help and you see the user might in the t_v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's good idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to have help button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you are display on the screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "on the t_v_ screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on t_v_ screen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so on the t_v_ screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "on the t_v_ screen the how to use your remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so just you push the button and we will .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that eliminates all the complicated documentation , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but people are often enough looking at the help , once they see the help button they say this is complicated .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if the if no in the case where they need help , in the case where they need help .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in marketing point of view .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and let us see what the market demands .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could just go to my presentation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's just for user customizable , for kids or old people .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids and if you remove the same remote with some both .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's the same can be used by both kids and old people .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what propose is that remote controller , it could be cube , is small device that looks like cube and you can just change the buttons , if you ch turn one side you get one buttons , you turn the other side you get the other buttons , so for new generation people who get used to the computer they want lots of controls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for kids , kids they like no they like to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so le let's see what people want .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let's see the market demand .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then we can decide what we can .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what market yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we also have some prizes for the most creative solutions .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we found the following solutions which we could which would be helpful for our design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly , they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and eighty percent of the people they are always they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and seventy five percent of the users said they zap lot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons , so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so this were the findings which we found .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "most of fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and people are always searching for them rather than watching the t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and by the time they found the remote control the program is finished .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so they're frustrated lot and if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you can just see the percentage , fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations this should be the solution for them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we should have an on the rem remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't really see the advantage of having on the remote control if we have big screen and display on the screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's fancy trendy and so on but it's expensive to produce and it's not really .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if we have on the remote , rather than looking onto the t_v_ you just look into remote and navigate it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's the same menu as we have saw that ipod remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we just play around .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but when you play with the ipod you don't have big screen in front of you , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can use this screen instead of the big se screen , instead of use the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you re-use the existing screen , we element eliminate the , after all the just to display and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy , as fancy as the one on the , even better .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this were the points which we got from the market demands .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the other one that's fine .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we can focus on the fancy look on the speech recognition if the technology is available but will make us spend lot of money for not so big results .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "more on fancy design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "remember we have budget for the cost of producing the remote controller .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have that should be found out by the industrial designers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so is so the thing is you can find out how much an will cost and then we'll decide again .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can find out the price and tell us next time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so price of display .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and also the cost for the speech recognition .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ask our and d_ department .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's for it's just for small vocabulary .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's only for limited vocabulary , say eighty commands or so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we it's not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and also the scroller button , how much will it cost .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and compared to the simpl simpler simplest button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the scroll button , from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or help button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that as we have seen in the presentation about fifty percent of the percent choose the button so to have five simple button is sufficient for our functionality .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't use the buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the thing is that we can add functionality on the t_v_ screen like list of function and then you choose with the button to you navigate and you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but they are just less used compar .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they're not used much .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the at most more power .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or we can or we can make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if we could have display user interface that is very complete on the t_v_ screen that just five buttons are sufficient , one to go up left down and enter and you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you don't have to switch to channel to another but if you look at the you don't look at the t_v_ screen so it's not really worth to get to have the image if you don't look at , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or it could be like this , as the people say , if they have on the remote not on the television .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because when you have the onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background , we are most focused on the commands .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if you have then in the remote , you just have menu , and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs and this menu when you press the menu , in the displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume , then the program , then the brightness , contrast and all the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and accordingly you can just increase or decrease .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's and it's increases the cost of the remote control if you use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that has to be checked out .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that there's no contradiction here , because if there are few buttons , you don't have to look at your controller any more because where the buttons are , so if you wanna control the screen sh sharpness you just say sharpness and then you turn you just press lef increase or decrease button and the same for the volume and the channel , if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel , just tell your channel and then you don't even have to look at the butto at the controller so finally that wil eliminates the need for , with the help of speech recogniser you can .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you will listen to peep , special peep .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "better if we could just check all the cost with and also with the speech recognition .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then we could find which would be more suitable in this case .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the third problem was to find the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "always , so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we can think about vocal command like find and when the remote control hears fine just to make him beep or .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , that's exactly what by voice commander .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or it could be also something like this , it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control , so we have some one charger there and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "put it back at the charge .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and when we're using that remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the remote control beeps , wherever it is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that's good idea , that's simple , like in phones .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it doe it also doesn't require voice command , because there are problems with voice command .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you don't have to move the charger .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "charger would be fixed because it's always with electricity plugged .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you have to keep it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if there is nuff not enough battery .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also and the remote is lost .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that we can what we can do is we can program function whereby when you press the switch off t_v_ button , the off button , the remote there be instruction on the screen , charge me .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you never get it lost because every time you're off the computer the t_v_ you are asked the command the t_v_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's an good reminder , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you will never get lost .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for some people lazy people .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because everything is programmed inside .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's all about strategy , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the final point is fancy look .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by norman they weren't fancy , very big with lot of buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they were ugly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "they the last one with the two parts was original , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should have something it you see if it's like that even kid who wants to have control he could just plug it and use it , you can't avoid him .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "with two parts controller .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you can have an button for child lock .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so just by pressing the button with some code , you put lock onto the remote , so that he can't use even .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can think about having on the user interface when you switch on the t_v_ you can write code or choose category , if it is kids , things like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or you have to show some specific programmes for kids and then just push kids button so it's automatically .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "these are probl .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if he .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that these could be included .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so for my part will check the prices difference of what to use , where to use , and so on .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we need to define also the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser because if you want say we can sort by channels or sort by t_v_ programs , you have to decide category of vocabularies for them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if numbers , they're easy , but if name the channel by name .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control like sports and then on the t_v_ you have list with sports program playing now and , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , we have problem there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you see if you have voice commands and you are watching score on basketball score , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you've just say twenty five and suddenly the screen the channel goes to twenty five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so there should be prefix to some numbers the you just check all the probability that saying t_v_ twenty five and just ordinary twenty five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but every possible word has probability to come about of the t_v_ so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ordinary twenty five you almost there's probability of being said around sixty seventy percent and t_v_ twenty five it will be round about one or two percent .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's better to have some prefix before the number .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than the numbers .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "something , some code .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you say numbe channel number five of the t_v_ correspond to something else in the channel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so some people may want to say , want to see this channel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that will be too big .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it will be difficult for the vocabulary also .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or just it's difficult to just say the name of the channel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "check with the and d_ department the capability of recogniser .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it will be difficult to say just the name of the channel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because you have to ch but you have to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's convenient for the user .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "als might be you just forgot the channel name , you kno only know the number .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or the user can create his own vocabulary , just pronouncing the name of channels and include in the vocabulary .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then , the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that have there's another way you can do is that you can if when the user ch press button to choose the channel , then what you can do is that the you can make the t_v_ screen to split them into small little squares of images where you have snapshot of every channel , so let's say it's four by four matrix of the images , so now what you do is looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time , you just use the control button , you just choose the option you want and then you just hit the button and then you go to that channel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you don't use the speech recogniser in that way .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just you have in the beginning you have to train you have to create the vocabulary by yourself .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also think about another problem , if there is more than one person who is watching t_v_ the speech recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "by associating each channel with the name or and for each one has his own .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because remember when was young child with my sister we always want to watch different emission at the same time so it's pr it could be problem if someone passes by when you are watching t_v_ and say t_v_ thirty and just run , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or you have to .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wanna watch this , wanna watch that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and in the same lines we would have one more problem .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring bad name bad reputation for our company .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use voice commands , say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or something .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or we can switch on or switch off the special , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that should be an option .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's good option because it's simple and simple to implement also , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "these are the practical problems .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we need to take care of them in the design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we'll discuss them in next meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's time to close this meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you stay five minutes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it came there on three minutes back so we are we can just press the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so see ya .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for your collaborations .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see you another thirty minutes .", "speaker": "D"}], "id": "xxxxx", "relations": [{"y": 1, "x": 0, "type":
