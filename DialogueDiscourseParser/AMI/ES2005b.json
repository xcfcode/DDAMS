[{"edus": [{"text": "minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that i've got from on high that are bit what didn't actually realise it was that the this is for specific television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the all in one idea goes out the window .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they require that the actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , presentations , were you anybody got , raring to go ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "raring to go ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "need to plug you in .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so how sh do you want me to hold it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's inspired design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there we go , just screw on in .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "gonna have to swap them round so now , it was function eight .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , after that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the wee blue one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "blue one eight .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "should do it , good one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "me again , rajan the marketing expert .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as we have decided in the last meeting that have to find out , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "hold on , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and if you just click that it'll go ahead , one at time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "actually , have to see the other , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , have to look at the market potential for this product , like consumer likings and everything , what is the potential for this product and are we able to achieve our net profit or our aims or not ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "press five to start it first .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then the methodology adopted to find out all this was market survey .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings , what they prefer what they not prefer , what problems they do encounter in all this type of things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and what we got was , we found that if you , what they what problems they are having with different remote controls available in the market .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they are not so good looking .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , we have to put stress on this , we have to take care of this fact also like our design , should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and yes that's wi this will definitely , this can definitely put enhance our sales .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and even the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high pay more for this good looking remote controls also .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so even if the available market goes for the available even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five euros , which may seem quite high but if our looks are if the re remote control we design have good better look designs , then we can hope that consumers will prefer these remote controls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then and the second thing , some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users or in their remote controls , but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky , too complicated too expensive because believe that technology is useful only if the consumers they want to use it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we have to take care of this fact also .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it was function want to go to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you wanna go back ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then if we look at this slide , these are in your shared documents , you can see , like , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , was just gonna say , what was the question for this ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or is are you coming on to that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "look all the market potential , what how we should design consu our remote controls , what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit , enhance our sales .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so these percentages are what ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these are different age group persons like , open it in another way .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to pay more for speech recognition in remote control or not , we can find that they up to thirty five years age group we have very good disliking for this point , like for speech recognition in remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we can emphasise on this point also like , because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from fifteen to thirty five , and that most of the users of the rem t_v_ are belong to this age group .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we should look .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're als we we're looking at who buys it as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can look at that factor also , so yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which the twenty five to thirty five is usual , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , and then yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "fifteen to twe .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we look at this data how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they find that thirt thirty five percent thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it should be in such way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we should provide pl spe proper manuals for its use also so as that people consumers could easily learn .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they need not to have any , much technical knowledge to see to know how to operate these remote controls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is also very goo major factor to loo take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this is all about market potential by me .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "follow on with helen ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", that's , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have to take that out .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "fun and games .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if the cable's gonna be long enough .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "kicked over whatever it runs on underneath as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "brian , this one also .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "turn my computer quickly if that's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "very much brian .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you want me to help , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then what do press , eight ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's not coming .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "function eight , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "computer adjusting , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then how do press the big one , to get it on to the big five and press that again to get it off as do ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "five and escape'll bring it back and just the left button for advancing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i'm the interface design designer , user interface designer , i'm concerned with what effect the apparatus should have on the user and i'm also want to point out that our motto , put the fashion in electronics , so we as company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable , it's big concern of ours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and how do press just the next button ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just left mouse button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so looked at existing designs and also the information that raj gave us was very useful about what people like , what people dislike .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and what people fashionable , because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main buyers of our t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what they like and what they find fashionable .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and ergonomics , we said , haven't actually been able to do any of this myself , but that comes up , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that can come under arlo as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the findings , the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's what people want to do .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so they need to be included , but i've got some pictures here of some leading ones .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how to get to them , do press five is it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you escape then you can see your bar .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "haven't got my glasses on so hope it's this one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these are two leading remote controls at the moment .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they're grey , they've this one's got loads of buttons , it's hard to tell from here what they actually do , and they don't look very exciting .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "personally prefer this one just because it's looks easier use , it's bit more sleek with more of this silver , but there you go , that's what we're up against , and we can do much better than that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we hope so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we need to the ergonomics is quite important , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "particularly if we've there was bit in raj's about r_s_i_ and things as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and not too edgy and like box , more hand-held more not as computery and or organic , more organic shape .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "simple designs , like the last one we just saw , not too many buttons and as raj pointed out , only ten percent fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons , so what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and how it looks .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "hand-held and portable is portamint is important because t_f_t_ have just released is it remote control for presentations or and big seven inch big screen , anyway , so , no seven inches isn't that big but anyway so hand-held and portable and about other functions for t_v_ but as you pointed out people don't actually want that , so we forget about that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's like , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also the company want to keep it stuck to the t_v_ for to keep down the production time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's for one t_v_ , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so the last thing which quickly mentioned in the other one was bit of gimmick to set us apart from other people , like glow-in-the-dark which does already exist but it's not very widely used don't think .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "easy finder with the whistle function , or rechargeable station because it's pain when you run out of batteries .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that , that's it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling , and was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or if is that function we want in the remote ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "haven't been able to , or some voice .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you have trouble whistling ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't , but know lot of people do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it just it has to be certain whistle too , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "suppose that's true .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "suppo you could have the you could have the instead of whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just , where are you ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's costly though .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping , shouting , and then , what would the response be ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it beeps back at you ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let me set this up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so plug it in , press five ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "function eight for the .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or function eight ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's just to lock it in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's got it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so as the industrial designer my job is to take an input from you , so it's good you went first , and jotted down some notes as to what are the needs and what novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's remember that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so raj told us that consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products , and he also mentioned that the current products don't always match users' operating behaviour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "lot of the buttons aren't used , and he mentioned that they're not fun to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and novel feature which we just brought up was this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , there could be little microphone on it , and any noise over certain threshold it'll pick up as distress signal from you and it'll beep back and say here am of this sort .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but surely that would have to be specific rather than above threshold 'cause if you had loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", that's true .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you could have tha that would be consideration to take into account yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "didn't mean to derail you there .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "tha that's for later down the road , and then as for the user interface it should be trendy , and not computery , so more low tech and not too many buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so took these all into consideration and also have some limitations from the boss .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and practical limitations which kinda threw out the window .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so did little research and unfortunately all had to work on was our corporate archives of the products we've made before , which include , space craft , coffee makers , and bullet trains or high speed train .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that what that is ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and having personally worked with all these products have deal of experience with industrial design of these .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with remote control , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , figured , just put all together .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you got caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your t_v_ , and as for the user interface problem , too many buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "give it one button and it's , for the cowboy in all of us i'm not quite what the function is there but it's you could have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like that design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is that just switches on the speech recognition and it's entirely speech operated , is it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so missed the budget thing , it was fifty million euros ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we gotta sell twenty five of them ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "fifty million was prof as profit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "now it's fif fifty million euros we've gotta make profit , so we're making that at twelve and half euros time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so mixed those numbers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "more realistically then , we need product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing , cheap plastic , that should be just like tenth of the price or less .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "an energy source which'd probably just be your regular batteries , we don't wanna have it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is that gonna mark up lot ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or little base station , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", we could do that too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "hadn't thought of that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that might cost more though , 'cause with batteries we don't need to provide , provide the first batteries , but it's more , it's that's cheaper to just provide batteries .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you think about these base stations now it's essentially just lead with self connecting brake in it , so don't t'd up the price that much .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "battery in it , kinda .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the unirs the user interface the canonical user interface for these would be just bunch of buttons , but since we're cutting edge company , we will have alternatives like speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power behind our product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and lastly the transmission interface is , just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so here's , schematic that my apprentice designer gave me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as you can see the remote control have parts and those parts look like that and it's got little operating procedure that looks something like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it and we wouldn't be in company designing remote controls if we didn't they were so personal preferences , programmable options which just require small amount of memory , non volatile memory , just so the user can put in their favourite channels and their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's good idea actually like the programmable options .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the , the bells and whistles that we mentioned , they take more budgeting , more technical expenditure of effort and it's also much more likely to not work if we add these bells and whistles .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's all got .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "very much , i'll take that back .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also so notice got not very long before the meeting , so didn't manage to forward it on to you , it is let's see , i'll find it myself , ta nah .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't think we need to screw it in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just push it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we had that to dis-include teletext because it's become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "dunno what oracle would have to say with that but never mind .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's only for the television , which i'm presuming means it's for specific television , and instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "everything , all their the corporate website and everything's yellow .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the logo the slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics exactly how incorpor , if you're going for globular shape you could have it working its way round it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now , we had as listed options we had speech recognition potentially , flat screen interface , interface we also want to limit the number of buttons so we'll take that one as read .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we'll use the basic functions for television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "although the danger with that is , it could look bit cheap .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not enough buttons you mean ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so sorta strike balance between few and or it looks like we're just cutting on the do however have this from over my head , that they don't want teletext on it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on the number of buttons , functions and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "raj you could find out what people would think about that , or they'll send some information about that , about what people , whether people would require teletext in remote teletext option in remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so take it your position arlo is that the bells and whistles we've gotta come up with the gimmick but not too complicated gimmick .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the inkling i'm getting from little bits of web chatter that i'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in t_f_t_ display , interactive display .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "however that does sound bit like the more complicated design that rav raj said people didn't like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "although if there's if you think about standard interfaces that people use already , windows-style drop down menus or whatever , that's bit , going bit far but like in basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons , and if you hit menu at the top you have it goes to different selection of buttons , so it sorta keeps it simple .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "glow in the dark , is that with light inside it or is it glow in the dark material ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "glow in the dark material was thinking .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that would be cheaper than light .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "may say something about ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "actually it's really very important point as if we look at the market because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote , in the room .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but are lost and means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "often lost was that , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but if we add speech recognition as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control , like if they come and speak something at the remote control replies to something and it glows in the dark .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "both these factors both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control , and this will definitely enhance our market sales , so we should take it into consideration also .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "speech recognition take it don't , i've know of no products that use speech recognition .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's they're act there was remote control that came out two years ago that had some basic speech recognition on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you could programme it with your channels and then you say like b_b_c_ one and it goes to that channel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it didn't work very though because of this noise interference problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they mentioned if the television says you are listening to b_b_c_ one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or an advert for b_b_c_ two on b_b_c_ one'll switch the channel for you kinda thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", and so there was lot of this , you'd be watching the t_v_ and then all of sudden it'd pick up noise and turn it off or turn the volume off , but if you can work around that noise problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what about this might get bit too expensive actually , but what about something that's built into the t_v_ that you can press and it'll send out little signal like the ones that we can't hear that will activate the remote control starts to beep .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's good idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so like backwards remote from the telly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you find if .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then it would do just , subtractive cancellation of the noise .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what you could do then would be you have remote controlled by the t_v_ speaker , or not remo i'm , microphone by the t_v_ speaker and transmitter there that sends back to your remote , 'cause you can't expect the television manufacturers to put that feature into their t_v_s .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's the only thing , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , then you have like the little se separate module by the t_v_ speaker which , and then the remote control would know what's being produced by the television .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that we should just stick on , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that comes with our remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that's basic r_f_ frequency so it'll be cheap .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's certainly possible then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you don't even need to find it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you just say , whatever you want the remote for , to change the channel or to turn the t_v_ on and off , you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within , within hearing range .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it could be somewhere in the room that you've no idea where it is and it would still do its job .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that could also be built into the t_v_ though , which might make our remote control bit obsolete .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "hopefully we're ahead of the curve .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it might do us out of job .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like the whole remote feedback thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so rather than and that also takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very and things like that , so and expense and the time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the expense .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if we're going to go like the thing about the there's the problem with the t_f_t_ or the thing is if you're also wanting the organic globby feeling to it then you might have trouble incorporating the screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but not thin we'll just pretend that's not problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and how are you about the glow in the dark material ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is that contrast contra .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not even all of it 'cause we said colours and fashion were important so just like little line that's around the outside and then you can make the rest different colour .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no the material's cheap but it's just the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it , and then if you're , if you're sitting in the dark for too long it won't glow any more .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if it's dow it's .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or if it's down under the couch cushions which is where usually find mine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "can use we can still use the glow in the dark as gimmick essentially , if we're gonna have to if we're gonna have the logo on as , bright yellow logo in our slogan .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause what , main slogan , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway , and we can have trimming as , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause , that more than finding it , that was more like if you're watching film in the dark , you can still see the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright , so sorta if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of feedback , remote finder , then that kinda stuffs that one out then .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that was more of gimmick .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you think ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it makes it fairly unnecessary then .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so scratch that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we've got do we want to go with the t_f_t_ idea or the is that far too expensive ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we're getting lot of features now , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the find the finder things it's could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "consideration too is that these remotes get abused lot , they get thrown around , there's good chance the t_f_t_ screen would break or get damaged .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they're pretty fragile .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs t_f_t_ screen ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , that was going on ravs raj's marketing research .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we'll stick with programmability for the buttons that we do have .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's included in your sub-module , you were finding out about teletext .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you could find out that we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as bit of expensive , no ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it takes cheap speech recognition , she they wi .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no
