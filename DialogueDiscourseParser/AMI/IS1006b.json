[{"edus": [{"text": "so hope you're ready for this functional design meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so will take the minutes you three are going to do presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need to know the user needs that we want to fulfil the from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and third part don't remember which is not very good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how to design this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so let's go for the three presentations , so first marketing expert .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if do that like this ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's being modified .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you want , open .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "hope saved it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , this is my name .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "know this name .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we met before .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so as , you already know me , sammy benjo .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "am the expert in marketing and want to tell you about what people want and like and dislike in remote controls , and hope this is going to help you to design it correctly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it is put five .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the full page presentation , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in the full page because spent lots of time doing this presentation , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what suggest is that instead of deciding ourself what could be and what should be good remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and what they do with them by the way because they are supposed to be useful .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't forget about that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we've conducted survey on the use of remote controls and i'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so what we found was that there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "first of all , they find it very ugly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "current remote controls as they're the same as this one they're not colour , not shape , they're all the same , and they're not good looking .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what is interesting is that it seems that they were people are ready to pay for and look and fancy looking remote control , so we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the other thing is that the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it the current facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we see that they zap very often so this is very important functionality that it should be easy for them to zap in one way or another .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and most of the buttons on current remote controls are not used , so we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only couple of people are using .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now people are very frustrated with their remote controls and they don't even find it it's often lost somewhere in the in your home and nobody knows where it is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we have something where we could ask the remote control , where are you ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like something to like phones .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "some of the phones have some of this functionality .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "phone you can always phone your phone but you can't phone your remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can you are .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but why not ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use , they don't even know how to use them , so most of the people say they how to they to use properly their remote controls .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and they are bad for r_s_i_ but don't remember what is r_s_i_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so they are bad .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "tha that's look .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "nobody has any idea about that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'ll check with my , it's technical thing which our .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's electromagnetic waves effect .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , don't .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology , and those waves have high .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , it seems that it's lot of people for concept that we but we have to take this into account .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but twenty six percent , do twenty five .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "every fourth , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's people really .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "every four some of us knows .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so anyway that's for what the biggest frustration of the user and what else do have ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one of us .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we've listed couple of functions that may be used by the user in the current available remote controls and the tables look very to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session , but it is very relevant .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "people want to have power button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "channel selection is often used very often used and very relevant .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now remember what is r_s_i_ it's repetitivity stress injury .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have to be careful with that word but anyway continue my presentation so , channel selection is very important , very often used .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "volume is not often used but people want to have control on volume and that makes sense .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "all of them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they're not often used and they are more or less relevant .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it seems that people find teletext relevant , even if personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have been told that we don't consider teletext , that it's out of date now because of internet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "tell you that in scale between one and ten relevant not relevant to relevant people scored six on this , which is not as these two one were had ten .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but if you compare with these ones , they scored one or two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not very relevant , so if there are good reason not to put teletext it's but just know that people find it somehow relevant .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's for the main functions and then we can ask ourself what people don't have that may be useful .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "net next slide .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one of the thing the trend that you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you wouldn't have to tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we've conducted survey about whether people would like or not to have this functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "young people , probably because it's buzz word , find it very relevant .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and as the age goes up the relevance goes down .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so now it really depends on the targeting wha who are we targeting with this remote control ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we are targeting young people then it's probably something we have to consider .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we are targeting you very old people this is something they really why they this should be so now this is , depends on that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and don't have any conclusion , didn't have time the meeting was very tight , so that's my findings .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , if you have any question ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's good , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you done good review .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "got one question , you are market expert so should we aim at the young people or not ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one question , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we should aim at the young people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but they are those who might be more interested in new device .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in general the early adopters of new device are young people , less than more than then teletext is useless for them , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then teletext is used less .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because they have other means of finding their information .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's good point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so now it's the turn of the i'm not of the technical function , so what effect .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's you , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's techni function of .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , user requiremen makes sense .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have to do working design so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's but this but number three , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , my name is mark dwight , and am responsible for user interface design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "however , project manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as i'm more an artist that's gonna be less technical functions but more user interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so next slide .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and general method which is seems to be very useful for our task is not to forget about occam razor .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we should never complicate things too much .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we should only make remote control , nothing more .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "nothing more than this , just remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , make click , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so here is this remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's quite standard one , but it's not from t_v_ , it's from much easier device like air conditioning .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , we can use it for t_v_ easily .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and some options else , and make click , compared to this one which one would you prefer ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would say the simplest one as long as there are the find the buttons that need every time need button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it can be middle of like , between those two li you should .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and our method is going to be , provide simple desires into simple actions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "our question of the style , we should remember that our company puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "be simple and you'll lean on this market .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "market is of remote controls it better , it's very , it's not an easy field to play , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so be simple .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for personal preferences that to make baby-proof remote control it got to be titanium .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's really good style , it going to be look like this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it is unbreakable and it is very universal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we'll have screen with back light which can change colours , and we can put all the options into this screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we'll need only few buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "all the other things can be controlled through the screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 'cause when you watch movie and you want to change something , you always try to find good button and click it , but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so press would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , screen with back light which can change colours , titanium , and what else ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "got just very few and good ideas .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we need power and volume .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and let us include two features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "when you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the t_v_ , the t_v_ turns on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and when does it turn off ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "when you don't touch the control but you go out of the for enough time like you it's question to our technical design , our two engineers .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you have sensing sensor machine that knows tech .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and another feature that would like to implement is volume control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "suppose you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like , you want to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa , and then the volume changes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or you want to go to the kitchen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's easy to do , you just control the according to the distance .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "according to your distance to and the angle , if you have stereo system .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm not about the screen , wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it can be just menu which can be controlled with left , up , down and enter .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is it touch screen by the way ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it gives instructions but it has to be with an back light somehow .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , its main purpose is back light , which change colours , which makes it easier to find , and each can it can respond for your voice , like it can turn on the light for you just to find it easily , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "see that you target several application not only t_v_ but like we talk about universal remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can be easily done , 'cause you got simple designs , we should put it to simple actions .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let it be universal , so you want to use it for your hi-fi system .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just few actions , few actions for everything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "all the rest , we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "since we were targeting really soon date for the issuing of this remote control we will only concentrate on t_v_ for the moment and then make it more generalised .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it's quite universal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can just extend it to any device .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if want to go to directly to channel twenty five , how would do can do that with this ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's say am on channel eight now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "these days we have hundreds of channels , that's not so easy to go just next when you have hundreds of channels .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would propose another solution .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or is it ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you use just four or five channels , ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so set up your t_v_ set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to twenty fives channel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in one remote control that i've seen , instead of doing that you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and sixty four are those that want to by cycled with my next button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's the same solution , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but even we can have some display , like you can de you can just button the number and then it go because .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "go to channel twenty five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one thing is that as said in my presentation people really do like to zap .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so even if they are only watching four or five channels , they want to zap out of the one hundred channels , just because this is one thing they do , zapping .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "on zap it's only next , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it's only next .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so but you have to .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we got these buttons here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or say this can be back .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press suppose two five they just press two and five and then .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it would be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can make different modes for each button and you can change mode zapping mode or current chan .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but since we are focusing only on t_v_ remote controls so we can have more functions for t_v_ if you want to go for universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "could we carry out some research if we really need this , like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "could have look at that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for your attention .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so now the technical aspects of this new device .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you prefer it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as , am mister ramaro .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "am an expert in industrial design of all electronic devices and previously devised many like digital calculators and electronic calculators .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so now i'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "as the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the device , like t_v_ or v_c_r_ or d_v_d_ player etcetera .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we will have portable device which will send message to the main device like t_v_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions , what we want on this portable device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and usually this so to do these functions we need an interface , which some pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's generally in the form of infrared or some sensor information .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , we need since we are focusing on our interface device remote control we need few components , mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like the keypad and buttons we want , and then we have some chip , it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are am one doing mostly digital devices we ought to have some processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then we'll have the infrared l_e_d_ source which sends the information to the main device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then we'll have switch in our main device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different t_v_s , so some t_v_s will have different encryption codes for doing channel changing and these things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "to make it quite an universal device .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because the people don't use one particular brand so or at least we have more than five brands , which are really good .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we need to check their specifications and do their encryption that's passing information to the t_v_ device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we need to have particular encryption codes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then , components , so we have the main energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared source and then we have some inside some chip in the device .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "since don't have much time so i'll input the connections to all this components .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and since also want to know feedback from our marketing expert and user interface , so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard , or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm , because since our user interface speech recognition and also marketing expert for the speech recognition is really handy , so we can have another , like simple speech recogniser on our d_s_b_ chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "since we have some energy this is our this normal battery , so this battery , once you switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put the small simple speech recogniser and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just , so that we just use simple recog no but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on train it , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but very good to sell .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , even in you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "think of all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them , and ha you cannot use my remote control , because it's targeted to me .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and what about the price of this component ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can make it in five euros and even less than that , because we want to have millions and in bulk , so we can make really simp and we want to make really simple device because we have only very few words like power , switch on or some like then we'll have something like this we'll have volume and then we will have particular channel , so users can listen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the user will just be able to say can you pump up the vo pump up the volume or it will be something like volume , up , down .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "ye no , user can use any sender but they should have this prompt volume and then volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words and because we can't really say user to say same wording then it become more mechanical and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "with keywords and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "couple of words .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then we can have channel they can say , want eight , because we like users have different programmes , they don't really follow same channels strict so we just want channel number , we don't want like b_b_c_ or c_n_n_ else because it will be complicated so we'll have only these three main basic anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem , it's it will be take care of our main .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it has to be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no it's conceptual question , 'cause now see this the picture in front of my eyes like user taking his remote control and shouting into it , volume up , volume up , and he's coming , he's really annoyed with this , down , up , down .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but then you first of all this is not functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , in no not only speech , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's on top of using the button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for this budget like twelve euros .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's an option .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually we can have one switch to like switch on , on and off , this processor and this really , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this d_s_p_s .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use d_s_p_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and like this key .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it may not be like very expensive , because since we are only focusing on t_v_ remote control so and we have only few things here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "sho to train , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did you consider the gest gesture recognition ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like , if want to put volume up like do take my remote control do like something like roll up or roll down .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this point we didn't consider because it's very expensive because our target is only like twelve point five euros and , even automatic on off is also bit problematic , because it different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really they just they don't touch the remote and you how much time you need to switch on or switch off and yay .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "very expensive , no ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's just we got really good market expert .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and volume control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so but sh should we target user personalised remote control ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so in given room there might be more than one remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we would have each one and with our own personal settings .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say , suppose they're watching tennis match then they can say after one hour they can make we can have .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wouldn't that make arguments ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "want and we can increase this the strength you can buy one with .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's no problem , we will sell more .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's send more , let's sell more .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have something else to say ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not very much , like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , we're just on time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can you just .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , we're now going to have the lunch break .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and we will meet again for the next meeting , and in this one want to be more focused on the individual actions the on the components so you will focus on the component concept the u_i_d_ mark will be focused on the user interface concept and our market expert sammy benjo on the trend watching .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "mark will it's in current price , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal coach .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we have to we say , only for t_v_ , not teletext ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "automatic on off control it's not possible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in the next step if we make it work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but speech recogniser can be possible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can think about that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and do you see something else ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should it be equipped with the , with speakers ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "speakers in the remote cont .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like , you want to find it , you shout control , and it answers is i'm here ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's or you want to phone him .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or just beeps ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it just beeps .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that would be enough .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "something very cheap .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that's ex that's expensive .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "since now all ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "especially the power , it really consumes because it should be all the time on and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "heard of devices where you just whistle them and they because of the frequency they just answer to that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it's answered .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , 't .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can't whistle .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "clap it's good it's universal .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can clap .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "clap is good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "tak just suggestion .",
