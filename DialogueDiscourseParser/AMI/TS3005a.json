"speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but first of all we i'd like to introduce you to this room .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as you probably have noticed there are little black fields on the table .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have to put your laptop exactly in that field so the little cameras can see your face .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there are cameras everywhere around the room especially here for your face , and this isn't pie , it's set of microphones and there are microphones here also .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but don't be afraid of them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they won't hurt you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ll i'm and my function is user interface design , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "said i'm the project manager and i'm hoping for good project and i'd like to hear who you are and what your functions are on this project .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's start with the ladies .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's me .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm the industrial designer and hope to look forward to very pleasing end of this project .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm marketing expert .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "my job is in the company to promote company or promote products to the customers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so also hope we have pleasant working with each other .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have some expertise from different pieces of the company .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "said we're working on project and the aim for the project is to create to design new remote control which has to be original , trendy and , user friendly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and hope we have the expertise to create such project such product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the way we hope to achieve that is the following methods .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it consists of three phases , namely the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as you can see , all of these phases consists of two parts , namely individual work part and meeting where we will discuss our work so far .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but first will tell you something about the tools we have here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "already talked about the cameras and microphones , but they are not of much use to us .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we will have to take advantage of these two things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they are smart boards .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as you can see , you can give presentation on them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and this one here is white board .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "will instruct you about that soon .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as you also noticed this presentation document is in our project folder and every document you put in this folder is it is possible to show that here in our meeting room .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and there are available on both smart boards but we will mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as you can see , this is the same tool bar as is located here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the most functions we will use will be to add new page , to go back and forward between pages , and to save it every now and then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board , like this if everything's , but first have to put it on the pen , you see i'm new to it too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then you can write things like test or whatever you want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as you can see you have to move it little bit slow , it's not such fast board , it's smart board but also slow board .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you can write things and you can also , when you click here , erase things , so we have est left .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you can also delete an entire page , but we ask you not to do that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just simply create new one and start all over because we want to save all the results .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does everyone understand this application ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can't erase anything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can erase it with the eraser , but you shouldn't delete an entire page , but just create new blank one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "will delete this one now because we don't use it yet .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you can erase when you make mistake , but don't delete entire pages .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you can also let's see it's here change the colour of your pen , take blue one and change the line width like to five .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's what you will need for our first exercise , because i'm going to ask you to draw your favourite animal .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's also to gets to know each other because i'm asking three things , for that drawing , to do it on blank sheet , with different colours and showed you how to pick colour , and also with different pen widths which also showed you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and favourite characteristic can be just one word .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'m not very good at drawing , but will go first and try to draw or you should what i'm drawing , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "seal , seal .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "could be everything .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with tail and mouth .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when put on this thing it could be turtle , or snail , and but turtle has .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it has wings ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the snail doesn't have legs .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and those are slow .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and hope our project group will not be slow , but we will work to good result and do it as fast as we can .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "time for another animal .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would you like to go next ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it was four months ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to make it little bit easier .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "make that cute .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , it's giraffe .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's easy to recognise as giraffe .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the favourite charis characteristic is that the long neck , it can reach everything .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and hope also reach lot with this project .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that's my favourite animal .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "anything else you need to know ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "could you write the words , underneath it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or more words .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so draw , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can what it is , hope .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it's quick , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's my favourite animal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and our final drawing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "draw i've drawn dolphin because of its intelligence .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one of the most intelligent animals in our world .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can try out the eraser now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not perfect , but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "see we have some drawing talent in this group , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "animals , words .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "back to business , back to the money part .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "from the finance department have learned that we are aiming for selling price of twenty five euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we're hoping for aim of fifty million euros and we are hoping to achieve that by aiming for an international market .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the production cost will be twelve euro fifty max .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "t's time for some discussion .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i've wrote down some examples here of what we can speak about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what's your experience with remote controls , what ideas do you have to design new remote control , for which market segments should we aim , or should we aim for all segments .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually i'd like to hand the word back to you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what's your experience with remote control ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "lot of buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "always lose them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you always lose them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "lot of buttons which you don't use or who you don't use complex .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not user friendly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "search for the buttons , which one is which and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "boring , it's not fun to use remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "black , all black .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we should try to make it fun .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they use batteries and poor signal .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the angle you have to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "perhaps that you have lot of road remotes road con remote controls .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you had different remote controls for different devices .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "different remote controls , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , perhaps you can integrate them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for the use of different devices .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "your stereo and your t_v_ and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "perhaps that's an idea .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but then again you still have lot of buttons , so flap .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you could thin there's possibility to put those buttons behind some protection so that if you only get to see them when you need .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and which you don't use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": ", that's possible , but it'll get very big the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's possible , so that you only get the no , just you got the same size remote control you use everyday , but the usual buttons such as zapping as you call it in dutch .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you should just give it to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the volume control are only the only possible buttons to use directly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or the numbers , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but not the buttons used to search on the channels on your television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on and off .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you only use those the first time , or .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "play , pause , stop .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so minimalist design , the least possible amount of buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you should make that you have every button they need on it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because things for teletext , what's the name ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you don't want to bother people with loads of buttons , but on the other hand they need many buttons so they don't have to get out of their seat .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if it's international you should look in britain they have different things they can do with the t_v_ , or so that you can choose what you want to see .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because market will be all people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "elderly el elderly , young people , so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you should take that in consideration , or that you just should aim for the normal t_v_s that and the b_b_c_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's the better one , because if you you're going to target lot of people and the whole world and only britain then the cost will rise higher than the twelve fifty , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if the they have that anywhere else , though .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the aim is better to use the whole world and britain , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can leave that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "when of it the main idea of this remote control is to make it user friendly .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "not that much .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so when the customers will buy this remote control , they already have the remote control which companies with the standards remote control with which comes with the television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it only has to have the most used buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you don't have to integrate the buttons to search the channels on your television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in those in that but it is impossible to accommodate all the buttons on the difference different televisions sets on one remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then you have to find your other remote control if you want to search .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it it's that's not , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's not , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because sony television has the opportunity to make it possible for to see on one side of the screen teletext , and on the other side just regular television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but they don't use the same signal , on remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "most televisions nowadays do this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because you can't use panasonic remote control on philips television .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then you have to choose the this always with universal remotes you have to choose the code .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can choose the code .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can use which type of television you have .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's no problem .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but like the two pages on the same screen , like teletext and normal television , that's nowadays standard , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that most people will buy the remote control because the first they lost the one they lost first one or the first one is broken , so perhaps they have got an older television , so that option is not optional for those people .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the people have new television , and if you look into the future , then they want will want the button , if their thing is broke .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we should take that in consideration .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "any more ideas ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "things'll come up .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have some time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's see what more have to tell you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't think there is much left .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're starting to close .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our next meeting will start 're little bit early , but our next meeting will start in thirty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in the meantime there's time for some individual actions .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as you can see , the different roles have different tasks .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and there's ping .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it my laptop ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "stop the meeting now .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's good , five minutes and the meeting's over , on schedule .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "meeting will close in five minutes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the marketing expert will take look at the user requirement specification .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the user interface designer will work out the technical functions design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and this was the interface designer ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or the interaction designer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or what was it , i_d_ ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "interface designer , first was .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "will take look at the working design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , the industrial designer will take look at the working design , and the in usability interaction , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "industrial designer , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's just use the acronyms .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so should look at what you should be able to do with the remote , or how don't really .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and specific instructions will be sent to you through your personal coach .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "those instructions will be in the email you will receive shortly , hope .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you have your own expertise .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that was what had to say .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are there any more questions ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we have to head back to our offices and start working .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have one question .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "where does it says we have to make remote , because presumed she didn't know who .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , no problem .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're still going .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "expect everything will be much clearer with the instructions we will receive shortly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see you all in about thirty minutes , then .", "speaker":
