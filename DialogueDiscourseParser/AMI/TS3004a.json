some things in it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how does this work ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one most to the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes that one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that's my name , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're going to make remote control , you already know that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just have look , are we going to this agenda of our meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is about twenty five minutes , this meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the thing we have to you already we're going to do , you also read what this the things or , not yet , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly that's what we're going to design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first we have three steps of making the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "fir the first thing is the functional design , that's very important .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and how the remote control works , so that's where we're going to look in the functional design , it's for the next meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the second thing is the conceptual design , that's what it that's the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we have to look what the market is doing for what remote controls are in the market .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the third thing is the detailed design and that's exa , what it is , it's exactly how it looks and whatever .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so no , this is these are two smartboards , with the an introduction of that one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you already saw all that you here can put things in the red project map .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "folder , yes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so no have look at that one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what we're going to do first is so you can read .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have to draw favourite animal on the whiteboard and say why it's your favourite animal .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so and you have this is just to try it out and we have to use different pen colours and different thickness of the pen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , so first have to show you , you can come here to have look how it works .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see it now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this new page , it's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "use pen format .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and different colour can use here no take the pink .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you take there's no pink , just purple , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and line width ten .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just take what i'm going to draw is an elephant .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just draw slowly , because otherwise it won't work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's very elephant , you can see .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what it looks but it doesn't matter .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "something like this ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it look like dinosaurs .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just takes so long , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "whatever , just .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you erased this one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's bit slow you can see , this is bit annoying .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so just for you just one of you can draw painting if you want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let me try one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just don't , just use it like that , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then what's the colour ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's in format .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll take this one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there has to be water , but it's an animal it's an animal that lives in the water .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just no it has to be an animal , so if that's it's it should be shna snake .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the water is important .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so first draw the water .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and now make the animal .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is worm .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you have to write down why that doesn't matter , just it's to get used to the whiteboard , but it's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just make new blank page .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not too far to the pen top .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's make it dog .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you should hold your pen bit more to the back , so that no , to the .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , it's dog .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "make cat of it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we only have twenty five minutes , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "take it easy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was gonna make cat too .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "use your fantasy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not too quick .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just hold it more to the back then you don't have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no have it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "draw too quick .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , that's , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's just to get used to it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "these pens would be just you write it down and you download it to word , you already did it or no ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , not yet , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", it but you actually got to write on the paper .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it's just ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you really got to write on that paper .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "know , but it would be just in typed words in word , so that's not just it's just picture .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's real pen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's just picture .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's not that as thought it would be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you really no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can you can't edit in the edit it in word .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what time did we start this meeting , i'm not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "half past ten .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now we just have to save everything , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is definitely the best one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what we that we have to sell this remote control for about twenty five euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we have to make profit of fifty million euros , so we have to use big market in europe .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "piece of cake .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the production cost are about half the price of selling price , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so can someone make calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're gonna have little discussion about what experience are with remote control the and everything , so just have look how it we think about remote controls .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my first question was does it have to be universal remote control ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's good question .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because we sell it lonely from the and not with the television , we sell it apart .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's i'm not , it's not don't think you can buy universal remote control for twenty five euros , so not , but , so we just say we just say that's universal remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so because , know you can buy re universal control for only twenty euros , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it probably would be universal .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and only television ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or more devices ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and also for the v_c_r_ and d_v_d_ player and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "everything just so lot of buttons on the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not just t_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , just everything .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , what what's remote control , it's just black thing with some buttons on it , it's not nothing very special , but , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can try to make it special .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so do you have any ideas how it has to look for usability or user .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "about making it the same style as the television , we don't have the same television all the time , so that's no matter .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we control the v_c_r_ and the d_v_d_ player with it has to be clear , because kids and elderly are gonna use it , so it's not only for the technical persons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it must be very good control , so you can act use it from everywhere in your room , the infrared thing must be from very good quality .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "should be good point .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "nothing it shouldn't be too big , but don't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have lot of functions , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and how big should it be ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can't make it smaller than the things we see now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just big enough for the buttons we have , that's it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or we have to make something like mobile phones that you can fold it opem .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then you can make it smaller and uniquer , more trendy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you think about one you can fold open .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "fold open , where you can see more options .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "something on top , just dren general things like volume and t_v_ channels and inside things you don't use that often .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or you could think of an small touch screen on the remote control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for the d_v_d_ pla player , if you just .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's good , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "wanted no you can make an manual in it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "why should you use touchscreen on remote control ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "be it's , or to keep it easy and small .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there are buttons on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it's not reachable , touch screen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's not too expensive to put touchscreen on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that's , it's much too expensive .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like to have , it would .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we have to care for the strength of the remote control , because remote controls are most things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often broken .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if you have touch screen in it , it's definitely too fragile .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not kids ma home station .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can put games on your remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and how about the batteries ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "should you put it in recharger or just .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's good idea , just to put it on your television and just recharge , you never have to use any batteries .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's good idea , but , we have to look at the price now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how mu how expensive is normal recharger ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how much is your standards mobile phone recharger ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you buy it separately from your phone it's probably expensive , but what the project projection costs are for such thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have , 'cause .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you look at the market , it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , because it's too expensive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but home station is really good idea , because lots of people are lose their remote control and where it is , and now you can put it always at the same place .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's therefore it's good idea , but it's expensive .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "use it as separate option .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "sell it separately .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can , you can buy it with it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but have mouse that's also , and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station , or you can change your batteries , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the option , just the option , that's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "set something on paper already , size , looks , usable , the buttons on usable places , the on off button must be on top , it has to lay good in the hand , you have to , don't if we you can make it very special , to create our own looks , but it's very hard to nah .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "has it be has does it has to have to be like different form than normal remote control or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to look at that , 'cause you can do the standard way , but then you won't you can have the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the t_v_ channels one two three four as block , and then the volume on top , so you can see .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we want to make it special , we probably have to do lot of testing , if it really works .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the rest is you don't use that often , so if you have clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control , so you can do something unique with that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and what we have to think about too is buttons that you use often are like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you can still do the functions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what paul already said .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "on top are the basic options on top , and if you fold it open .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just for the t_v_ and just the normal function , that's fine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but , but when i'm watching t_v_ i'm just using like five buttons or so , so .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it's very hard to make it fold open and to look like it's very what's it's called ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you make to fold open it's or also an the strength is not as good as normal remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's hard no , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we have to keep it like square , just normal remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just think about it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have to close this to finish this meeting , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's some more things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have another thirty minutes , so then we're going to meet again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what you have to what you have to do ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for me the marketing expert , the user requirements specification , do need to think as user , as only the looks and the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , what you want to do with it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this if you have to it's for t_v_ , d_v_d_ player , all that things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "also from user , but all these things together .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's also about strength and for everything .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "also wrote down some that you want on technical fun fu what do you want to do with your remote control , what do you need on your remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no not , that's not that's something for .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's not for you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just if what's in the market , what's normal , what buttons do you have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "already wrote some down , some ideas .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just is that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's already document in the folder about it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so see you in thirty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for the next time you have to put it exactly on the square , so your laptop .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it
