[{"edus": [{"text": "good morning everybody .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm glad you could all come .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm really excited to start this team .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm just gonna have little powerpoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my name is rose lindgren .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll be the project manager .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "our agenda today is we are gonna do little opening and then i'm gonna talk little bit about the project , then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other little bit , including tool training exercise .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we'll move into the project plan , do little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first of all our project aim .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we are creating new remote control which we have three goals about , it needs to be original , trendy and user-friendly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're gonna divide us up into three compa three parts .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first the functional design which will be first we'll do individual work , come into meeting , the conceptional design , individual work and meeting , and then the detailed design , individual work and meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that we'll each be doing our own ideas and then coming together and collaborating .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're gonna get to know each other little bit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , what we're gonna do is start off with let's start off with amina .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alima , alima .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're gonna do little tool training , so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "introduce yourself , say one thing about yourself and then draw your favourite animal and tell us about it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which one of these have to bring with me .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , i'm supposed to draw my favourite animal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have no drawing skills whatsoever .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but let's see , introduce myself .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my name is alima bucciantini .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm from the state of maine in the us .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm doing nationalism studies , blah , and have no artistic talents .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how do you spell your name ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and i'm the industrial designer on this project .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so let's see if get here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "will draw little turtle for you all .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not necessarily 'cause it's my absolute favourite animal , but just that they're drawable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you have the pretty little shell going on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "some little eyes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what are your favourite characteristics ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like the whole having shell thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's quite carry your home around where you go , quite decorative little animals , they can swim , they can , they're very adaptable , they carry everything they need with them , and they're easy to draw .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "shall we just go around the table ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "my name is iain and i'm the user interface designer for the project .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and i'll try and draw my favourite animal .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll should leave that one on there shouldn't before callously rub it off .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , you can erase the turtle , it's alright .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "might be to have them all up there at same time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm not gonna draw it quite to scale .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is that at least identifiable ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's whale , yes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's , cat .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my , it's better than what i'm gonna be able to do .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , the reason like whales is 'cause they're , first of all they're quite intelligent and also they're mysterious , like we don't really know much about them or understand how they work , how they form groups .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and find them interesting animals .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "take my contraptions with me .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright , i'm jessy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm from around d_c_ ish in the u_s_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we're gonna keep the deep sea theme going on , animal .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't really know how to draw this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just where can .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if do the water , but how ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "give an idea .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have no idea how one would explain this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "with some whiskers .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "briefly , it's supposed to be seal .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can imagine it in the water .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like them , because they are like playful and silly have good time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not gonna try and pretend like get any better than that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm rose and i'm project manager , from california .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's actually coyote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's definitely significantly harder once you are doing it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "let's see , let's give it little bit of snout , some teeth .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's pretty impressive .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "live across the street from an open space in california .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have coyotes howl all the time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so really enjoy their singing , you they're really beautiful animals .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "moving on to slightly more serious .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're gonna talk about project finances .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we have couple we'd like to sell it for about twenty five euro with the profit aim of fifteen million euro from our sales and because this is such this is for television it's we have market range of internet , like it's an international market range , we don't have to worry about specifics .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "in order to make profit of this magnitude , we need to be able to produce each one at maximum of twelve fifty euro .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just to generate little bit of discussion about the project , could i'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , your first ideas about creating new remote control , what would be the best like you what are the features that you really like what are the features that you don't like , etcetera , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the t_v_ like you have to do one for the power of the t_v_ and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now they keep combining all different remotes together , and if necessarily like that 'cause feel like you end up with multimedia overload .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "wanna watch the t_v_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "always gets lost .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "some like device to help you find it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i've used , i've used remote controls , for things like t_v_ and the c_d_ player and video recorder and they're pretty neat little tools .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you don't have to get up and walk across the room to change channel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so especially if you're someone really lazy like me they they're pretty .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "find them they can be bit annoying , especially , like if i'm watching t_v_ have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me , one for the t_v_ , one for the digital box , one for the video recorder as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also they tend to they tend to be bit confusing , they've got too many buttons on them too complicated when all really wanna do is switch on and off , change the channel , change the volume .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "agree with having too many remotes around .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my dad has whole drawer at home of remotes for various things , and how to work half of them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what's important for me , is that it's easy to use and that there's not too many buttons , they are not too small , you need to you're doing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and one thing particularly like is if you are not moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there is way around that , but my residence now the television you have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on , so it's just simpler just to just turn around the t_v_ itself , and that's if we're gonna make remote control , it should actually work for what it's doing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what about like batteries and things like that , like are there some remotes that don don't require like batteries or do all remotes require batteries ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would imagine all of them , but we could but it's possible we could use like lithium battery that would last lot longer than like double a_s .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "something that doesn't .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like tho those are the batteries that are used in lot of m_p_ three players now and that thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it seems we have little bit of conflict over to combining all the remotes cont together versus having five different remotes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one remote , and yet you don't wanna have five remotes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so how do we work with that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "could we get something that just has no doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program other things that i'm not very coherent about , but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything , volume control , on , off , channel changing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that spatially divides it , so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the t_v_ on that's , like the top thing on the remote , if be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it , but if it's like all the t_v_ was here , then all the v_c_r_ was here , all the whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together , 'cause then you like , don't even i'm turning on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and if you'd save the more complicated functions for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because that is one thing that remotes tend to have buttons that the t_v_s no longer have as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so like you have to have them somewhere , 'cause you're gonna need those special functions occasionally .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but not necessarily on the normal remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can ask , are we designing remote control for television only , and if this device is just to be used for the television would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or should we just stick to just stick to having television related buttons on it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's good question .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll look into that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's just t_v_ , if it if we're taking it just new product new television remote control that's not like doesn't say .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "things might be more advanced than that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we should assume that it's just television that we're wanting to control .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "suppose it would be to have playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as if that works technologically or not .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have to define what we're aiming for .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it's just television then that it's bit simpler , 'cause there's less buttons that would even need to be on it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's an idea with the buttons being really .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye , it's really quite important that you are not pressing small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "sounds like we've had good little discussion for our first ideas .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "mind if we move on ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "believe we've actually been only working on this one for about twenty , so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like , but this is just breakdown of what we'll be doing individually .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the industrial design , alima will be doing the working design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the user interface designer , that's for .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "technical functions , like keeping in mind the buttons thing , the size of the buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "user requirements , so you'll be hearing about different trends , about different things that people need , the same discussion that we've been having , we'll get from the actual consum consumers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "realised in this past one we didn't have much , we just wanted to get little brain-storming done .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so very exited to see all your animals and how what wonderful artists we all are .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what we're gonna be discussing at the next meeting ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do we know that ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "haven't gotten an agenda yet , i'll put that together .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm as we'll each get our own instruction and then because what we gonna do is first our individual actions and then we'll come back together .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'm we'll all have more concrete things to contribute next time i'll type up mi minutes and probably email those out to all of you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm we'll be busy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just including all the things that we talked about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can you e-mail your slides as ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is that possible ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'll just attach it to an email .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you're number two , three , four ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that correct ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it was lovely meeting you all .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just make you keep checking the company web site and the emails .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let me see if do that now .", "speaker": "A"}], "id": "xxxxx", "relations": [{"y": 1, "x": 0, "type": "Explanation"}]}]
