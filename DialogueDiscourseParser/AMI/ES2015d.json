[{"edus": [{"text": "here we go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright , the agenda for thi .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the agenda for this meeting is we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that we gave it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have spreadsheet where we can calculate our prices for every aspect of what we've made , given our options .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and evaluate the product , as group .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so first we'll have the prototype presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you need the powerpoint for this ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "got few slides , so show them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you want to present it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is what we came up with .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "here we are .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's pretty simple design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's based on mango ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we have the company logo here and this will be the infrared here and this'll be the power point , the on off button kind .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what was the where's the l_e_d_ ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's in the middle of one of the little r_s .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then the other one is the power .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we just have simple design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we wanted it all to be accessible from your thumb palm-held and all the buttons are accessible from your thumb .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's palm-held .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "notice you have number ten button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you don't have to that was mistake , wasn't it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , that's zero .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you just need the nought .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "take that one off .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "was in charge of the numbers .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so one plus one would be eleven , or because if you on your average remote , if you press one twice you just go to or say you wanted channel twelve , you press one , and then you go to channel one , and then two then you'd just go to channel two , instead of twelve .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can go one , three .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you press that first and then you go one three .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you press plus button ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i've never heard of that kind before .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just thought , we have all the numbers here , so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and so the plus and then .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve , or two plus two is channel twenty two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , all that's why we have all these numbers .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "these numbers all work independently up to nine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if you press , it'll go to that channel away .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause you gotta press the plus afterwards .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "know , but if wanna go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if press the six it'll go to channel six , and then i'll press the plus , and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no you press the plus first .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "doesn't we haven't really would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five , but she says plus press which what do you simpler ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't mind , we can further define that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it wouldn't be problem .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wouldn't have thought it'd be problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but was just wondering like as long as we realise that's what it'll do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but suppose it's not as snappy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the there is there's delay on remotes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "where you can have it it's like five second input time .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you don't put it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so as long as you hit them dada it should be fine .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as long as there's not big pause between the hitting the two buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and channel , which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it , like it's the bigger .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was there so on the top there is volume and channel up volume up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "c_ and v_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just so we can flick it's in the middle of one of the little r_s .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "where where's the power button ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's just like .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's all accessible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we deci we went for like circular design for the numbers because we thought that's more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "without taking your hand off the remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ergonomics are all considered .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ergonomic , definitely ergonomic .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it could another type of repetitive stress injury though .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but , no it's different movement so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the feel of it , we've made this out of play doh , which is representing the , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause it was said before in the material specification that this the this anti-r_s_i_ material is often used in stress balls so this has got bit of give to it , and it just feels different .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "bit of stress ball feel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would you like to feel it yourselves ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how it fits in the palm of your hand ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "killed the five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "killed the four .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "as for the colours , we were presented with limited range of colours for this prototype .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it smells good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "of play doh .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we're thinking that , seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway , that this is not necessarily representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or the combination .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour combination just could just be named after different fruit , like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green , or vanilla might be the most popular if it just blends in more settled cream instead of the others are all bit garish .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause it'd be quite subtle and .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it looks more think like vanilla and banana would .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "banana's more representative of our colour scheme , like the company the yellow and black .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "watermelon , probably appealing to the , seasonal .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "kinda christmas , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "apple green , brown , more kinda trendy , khaki .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the pomegranate's kinda girly and funky , and then the vanilla's more for the more sophisticated customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we thought of the components it was definitely focus of ergonomics and just single ha handheld device , you don't need to use both hands , one hand to hold this and type in with the other , you can just use your thumb .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "as we said the rubber's probably used for comfort and anti-r_s_i_ and that's about it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "alright , very much .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "good work everyone .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "bravo you want the what order it goes in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so now that we've we have prototype , we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches what our budget can handle .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , have something i'm going to minute .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you need to do presentation first ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm gonna check that out for second .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what time is it anyw you're .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "evaluation criteria is next in line .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there we go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "come on my computer .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "my computer's giving me technical difficulties .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just press function eight again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should press it again ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "last time did that it sh .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one more time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "still not there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now for this one could would you prefer use the whiteboard or mayb i'll just do it on the screen where you can see it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings , made list of what our original requirements and goals were , back to our kick-off meeting this morning .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we'll evaluate as to whether we've done what we set out to do .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we're gonna do it on one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the lower the points the better .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so question number one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "does the remote whoops .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm not gonna be able , i'll do it on the whiteboard .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'t change it so i'm gonna ask you to push it down once .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'll write down our scores up on the so number one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do we have fancy look-and-feel ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we've been quite successful with the rubber coating and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the look is little bit more playful .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that depends on your definition of fancy , but it's definitely different .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's not your traditional .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the colour has lot to do with it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that we would've necessarily chosen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's not the sleek red , black and yellow , and orange .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you were only given red and black ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so not very sleek and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if you can imagine that in like just pale metallic-y finish know t's for rubber .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we want it to be stand out that way , anyway .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "metallic-y finish we were thinking .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "diff if you can visualise this in colours it would look quite fancy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "kinda like the potato look .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's very different .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "potato , mango , fruit and veg .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we were thinking about .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the mango look .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it is , fruit or vegetable depends on your mood .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's really adaptable .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so myself would say one or two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would say two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'd say two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and one being true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for the fancy two , three .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing , like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the use of the rubber .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "use of the rubber , the use of the l_e_d_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for the anti-r_s_i_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the l_e_d_ use isn't particularly innovative and we don't have any scroll buttons , it's all pushbuttons , there's no control , so if we're thinking about the rest of the market , it's probably halfway .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in some aspects it is , like we said .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'd say three .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll go for three as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it it's tough to say because we were we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would've defeated the purpose .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we want it simple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "though it was our specification .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wouldn't be simple , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we'll put three , but we actually reached our goal .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we didn't want it any more than that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "question number three .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "will it be easy to use ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one for that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's you can't really get confused with that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there'll be we have to work out the number the plus system .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the plus number thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's the only thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but once that's figured out , it should be fine .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and perhaps the turning on but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is this good-looking remote ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "again the colour comes into this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "colour will definitely be factor .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that the logo could be smaller .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and not such prominent way .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the remember the management said that it had to be prominent .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "like at the bottom , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not in don't worry .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it just had to be on there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "should just not touch it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this time it's the three killed .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was just wondering if it should be like flatter .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or the bottom could be like ch chopped bit .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "suppose i've got quite big hands .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like the appeal of it being like big glob in your hand .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but what i've just thought of there now .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what where's it gonna sit in your living room ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if the bottom was just flat , and then the rest is like round .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it would still be comfortable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "thing is like that , it's not going anywhere particularly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could handle it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it could be on the bottom , so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here , so it sits up .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that would be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it'd fall over all the time though .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it'd be annoying .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's less , what's ha .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it's weighted .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's got higher centre of gravity like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "details , details .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're done designing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , is this good-looking remote ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would we wanna show it off to our friends ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you would though , 'cause it's bit it's more interesting than other remotes .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it was another colour and it was like it'd look .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "gue , it's personal taste , but .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that , but definitely in another colour , i'm not happy with those colours .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so should we say two for that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "question number five .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what's will people be willing to spend twenty five euros on this product ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when remote control looked fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have to market it in the way , that to say that it is simplistic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so people don't just see it and think , this is so simplistic , don't want to spend twenty five euros .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have to market it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it the marketing will have lot to do with it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the kinetic energy , shaker-style-y , whoo , no .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the kinetic energy part .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "shake it and the buttons fall off .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't shake no the plus .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , those'll be firmly on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you're use the zero .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for , but am , aren't ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "make new one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you're our marketing expert .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they're about ten po ten pound , aren't they ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "about ten pounds .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you don't have to buy batteries .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so in the long term this can actually save you money .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", that's true .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we'll market it that way too .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so with good marketing scheme and the personalisation options , it'll .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would give it two still though .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can someone read it out ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that was mainly that the statistics we said .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it does very .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because , because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the channel-changing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and it's just you won't have to think about it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you don't have to look down to find them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they're clearly there , easy to use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the key word there is average , 'cause there were some people that used the video input and sound and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but they're not you and really .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "heather could you push it down ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "will this remote control be easy to find when lost ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now is there the is the alarm system still was it implemented ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have the alarm system .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the bu when you press the alarm system , the lights behind the and it'll vibra it'll be again in the marketing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it lights on and , or flash as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it's not obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't particularly see an alarm .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the light from the inside was gonna light up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the light it will .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or was it gonna make noise ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but when the alarm's not .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you press the button it makes noise ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it turns into duck and starts quacking .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that would be brilliant .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'd be tempted to .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the thing is , if it was had an alarm system , when it lights up as we it could light up when the alarm went .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if it was hidden underneath the cushion , there wouldn't be any point .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you can't see the alarm , but it would light up .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it would have to be in the market but you still couldn't see it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "though it was gonna make noise .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alarm , but you can't see an alarm inside the alarm system itself .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it would just be little speaker on the back .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , it'll be there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we can we could say that we can give it one , because compared to every other remote ever made , this one will be easier to find .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "question number eight .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that wasn't very clear .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no problem , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it has to be , it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll to do .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the plu the plus once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple , won't it ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the plus thing needs to be worked on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just because it's we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons , that in itself makes it so much easier to use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do does it make more sense for the middle one to be an just an enter button ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so then you would have to push two buttons every time at least .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's just like channel six , enter .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that annoys me though , when it's zero six when you have to press why .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but you don't have to press zeros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you could just press six enter , or one two enter .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and or sixty six enter , that's probably more straightforward .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then like twelve , enter .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright , aye .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we can we'll say yes it's one ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'd say one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "question number nine .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "will it minimise the effects of r_s_i_ , which was repeated strain injury ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "which affected over quarter of users .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's soft , and people could .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's like in the your thumb might get little bit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if you're zapping .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's what was thinking .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't will , the biology .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we about .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but it is soft .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's what the powerpoint slide thing said would be good for r_s_i_ , so it is but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what other options there are .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're getting that's true .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "could , you could hold it in your left hand and use your index finger .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but there's not really any other options unless it's like keyboard .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , we did as much as you can with remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , one or two do you think ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'd say two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes we did .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is the yellow .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we can't really do that because on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it won't stand out .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's not always gonna be the same colour .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it sounds like the colour's something that we but the yell yellow's ugly though , depending on the so we'll have to talk to our executive managers , and see if we can get away with just the r_r_ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the colours are yellow and grey .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it could be grey on the banana one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "could be grey .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we didn't even rea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is the factor that we've been least successful in confronting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "perhaps metallic or like that's grey , and it wouldn't be that expensive to have little bit of metal .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that isn't rubber .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the buttons in the middle .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , do you think that's more of three then ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "three , four ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't what do what .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have good reasons for it , so we but we can still put four ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and final question .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "current trends of fruits and veggies , desire for sponginess .", "speaker":
