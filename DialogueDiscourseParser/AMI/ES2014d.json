the cost implication .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the only snag about this is that the cost is probably important .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , and then the production evaluation , as to how

you may remember that was one of the first considerations was to be in under twelve fifty or two and half twelve and half euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if you had to do presentation or will

, there's no redesign .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that should , so , seems to me that the thing that have to do is quickly find that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "could we get this on the board just so we can see or do you mean do you have the figures there ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we should plug it in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the back of that one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , sh this should be then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we could do it as we go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , by the fact that we've got the simple chip and the kinetic energy source , we've got single curved case .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've got rubber case materials supplements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "have push button interface .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the button supplements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "originally , there would just be one in there because it was the one red apple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but so the real question then would come in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you make all the buttons , so we've got one special button form , which was the apple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do we'll do it on the prototype , so do two , see how much it is .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "everything else is gonna be standard .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then we'd have so that's nine point one there so we've got some .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we've got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that , so , was originally , was thinking rubber wasn't special , but according to this , it is .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so and the effectively we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you just do one , don't you , for the it's just one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is the answer , is that meant to be all sixteen buttons , and therefore , what's the op the option was not to have rubber buttons , but just to have the one that was soft and spongy , and therefore whereas it would be the special colour would be for the so you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "else thi the button supplement is just supplement for all the buttons made in different material , rather than per button .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would every design change is , if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'd have one special colour and one special button form .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and when plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and half .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "as far as know , that took care of the various supplements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if what happened ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you've just gone off the window into another one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's on the bottom row .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , but the point would be that if we just did special , you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it , is it is no , it's nine point seven i've got .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just give us bit of switching around those on the electronics we got the sample sensor .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , that would work out fine if as assuming your correction are assuming that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and there's nothing else as far as see that we had planned to put on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "at the moment we've just got the simple chip , which costs one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech so if we got rid of like the one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition without , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we , that gives us twelve point seven but remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the , see , so just take out the special colour for the apple and go for battery instead .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wouldn't you have to keep the simple chip there as ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "how you turn that one to zero , wouldn't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things , so you need both of them ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have to have it .",

would give you one less .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you reckon that the thing is that you wanted to appeal to people and not have to replace batteries .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "since it's the through the whole technology type thing , you were saying in the market research that people like interesting gadgets in them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "whether they would figure the sample senor and the sample speaker , voice recognition be worthwhile thing to have .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then still have the batteries , or whatever they would prefer not what ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the problem was the battery's running out and losing the remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you gotta decide which of those is more important to them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but which do you think or which do we the more important of the options ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the voice recognition .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in sense , at the moment , we've got total which we need to reduce down by one point two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "remember that was minimum requirement .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the other option if we're planning on just going cheap and cheerful , would be to make it originally , we're gonna make it simple product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first , and then make decisions about what needs to be changed after ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have little thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , we've all got note of it's thirteen point seven , isn't it , with everything we want on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do you want that back up ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "had presentation to do .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but do think the voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the prototype we've got here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so the method is that the design team makes prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and those ones are gonna be in response to market research , and also finance , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and do that on scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it's neither true nor false , then that's four .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , got set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in financial one as , at the end .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , we have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the whether the product demonstrates technical innovation .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "whether it's easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "whether it's incorporating the fashion element to attract the buyer .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and whether it's recognisable real reaction product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this , so i'll go over here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the first one is , does the product look and feel fancy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so if we do one so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have single curve , which was like the feel of the product's quite good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that'd be considered fancy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'd give it two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "of but what is one false , or is one true ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one's true , and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "seven's fal four is neutral , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and four is neutral .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause we haven't got the double curve , so we can't like say it's completely true .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "go for one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it's pretty close .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we've got almost everything we can .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "gonna put underneath so i've got some more space .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , false is seven , true is one , and so say about two for fancy , you think ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "why not , nearer three .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you do an average at the end , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's just that saying something remember that when you look down , we've got solar power , we've got various other things you could have , and we're not going for these options .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is just this is just for like the look .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "does it look fancy rather than functional .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , so that so sh should we go for two on that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "deciding between the kinetic power or the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show reasonable amount of speech recognition .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , what about the pr the prototype as it is , we've got the speech recognition on it , haven't we .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but not the kinetic .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but not the kinetic .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like the power .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause you can't afford that we took that out too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , we ca , we can't afford both .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "alright , so it doesn't it's pretty the prototype as it is isn't fulfilling the .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or , minute .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no may is about neutral plus it it's got something , but it hasn't got .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in thirteen point seven we do have kinetic .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would give it more than four .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , it's very much dependant on what you do with your options .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then because that the other functions we've got in are more at the special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if you go for that , that's at the high end 'cause that's point six , whereas down at just special colours is point two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now you're trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors speaker , you're then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the simple way to do it would be to have battery , to have your sample sensor speaker , and then you're looking to take out point two , which would be come from the button supplements category .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm just gonna check my email .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for the product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how much of difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then it stand the test of time better .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "interface type , plastic rather than rubber .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that would make the significant difference .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you could either you could have it if you have in plastic rather than rubber , then that would enable you to get you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you'd be looking to take out point two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you could fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that would enable you to do it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it says if we make slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ye , but it's rubber as it is , yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "read the email again and it says it's evaluate the design as it is , so we need to think about finance after we've evaluated that design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "whether we're doing it in the wrong order or .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "suppose it's rubber as it is , isn't it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , does this need to go up bit , 'cause we've got both the speech .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we got we've got thirteen point seven and we've got it in at the moment and if and , we're going to reduce down from that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the current one , you'd say would be fancy , would be too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for innovation , so we've got the speech thing , and do you reckon two ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would've said about two as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "two or three .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'd be happy with two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the next one is i'll have to get it back up now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the next on , just sing about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "easy to use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would've said yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would go for one on that at this point in time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would say so as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it certainly has some .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it does , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's got the cherry and the sponginess .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "say about three ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", it was just doing it quite .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're gonna have to lose some of these , but the moment , as it stands , it's the sensor using all of its all of its products , all of its buttons , and it's got fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "woulda said two would seem reasonable .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the product is recognisable real reaction product ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's bit rough at the minute .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is about the corporate image of like new sleek technology and all that thing , as having the logo on and all that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so is it recognisable product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "does it fit in with our other products , which are coffee makers and spacecraft .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "t's got the same speech feature as the coffee machine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also it's spongy rubberiness is bit more kinda comfortable than kinda sleek and new age .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it depends which way you look at it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we're going for two , three ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so two or three ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's so should we get so are definite was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "two or three .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the logo would be more recognisable on the actual thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's just that the pen wouldn't really write on that paper .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , the logo would definitely be recognisable .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it does have attributes that other products do .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "go for it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "two or three .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's that decided .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements , and then about two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what does what do all them numbers mean then ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do we add them up and rate or anything ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we , we add them up so at an average is gonna be i'm just gonna do this in my head .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one point eight isn't it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , pretty close to two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's pretty good at the moment , but it's gonna get worse , isn't it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we've gotta try and make it doesn't get too bad .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we need to so this is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the finances i'm not .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "put it back on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll probably have to re-rate it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , would've thought so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll make the adjustments and then see how are rates are going .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what was it , control eight , wasn't it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's come on already .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , you can see there that the if you want to keep kinetic , you've got choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you've got the sample sensor and sample speaker , which is your big item .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually we just have plastic case , then we lose two points , which gets us in within the budget range .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which gets you yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that'd be fine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because that was just trend , and we do have rubber buttons anyway .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's eleven point seven , and then we could make we definitely had all the button supplements .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "different colours , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "was thinking that because the rubber case is bit less in the corporate identity than the sleeker plastic case .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that would allow us to have all the technical innovations .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we're going for plastic , yes ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we'd lose little bit on the , and that would now be , that's within the budget .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "lose little bit on the fashion , but and then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "do we actually have do we just have one special forms down here ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there was debate as to how you would count them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we we've got enough for another we've got nought point eight left , so we've got enough for another , but the special colour , we've got three now just because the volume buttons are different , we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would just be the standard colour .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you got special colour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "originally was assuming we had the red apple , and therefore , that was the special colour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we should just imagine white buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we've got special form .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now that would be one button , and the question was buttons or is that just one button .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause our plan really was to have one button only with special so no matter how you look at that , that would be the same .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the other thing would then be special material , rubber , wood , titanium .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , special colour , you want three in there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which we should , they'll still be fine for the price .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "thin you just need two for the special colour 'cause it's just two supplements , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one original colour and then two supplements , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that makes sense .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's probably it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we only ne we only need two for that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause these are moulded .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the one colour's gonna be moulded out of piece of plas of rubber , isn't it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would agree with that , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so special colours , two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we've got special form is the one apple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the rest are all standard , although you could argue that should be you were making these buttons down the bottom , was presuming , bigger than the other ones , or were you ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ne that'll be second supplement .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "was that the idea ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the volume ones should stand out bit .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then there's spe second special form .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "would have thought that's probably about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you got twelve .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so tha so shall we do , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that should still be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's twelve point three , so we're still within budget on that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that makes sense .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so decide we've lost little bit on the fashion and lost bit on the fancy kinda side of it , but generally speaking , we've kept the other attributes to the that's without .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "woulda said so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you'd put fash fan fashion at three rather than two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and specially it definitely could fits the real product what was the what's the company name ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "real reaction produ i'm not quite , what does that mean ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it still seems definitely fit that so that's like if that's the new age inno innovative type company , then having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is quite high up on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's if we've put in for another special form on button , then they could be different shape .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would you mean of you could argue you might do it once year , you would change , because at the moment you're making red apple .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like we got cherry one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "other ones could be something else shaped .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that would be poss seeing as it's cheaper to make them different seeing as we've got , we've made it special form , so and that would keep us close on the fashion type one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and it would , keep it quite fancy as , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's whatever fruit was in fashion next year .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so next year you could make next year's model the same , but have it as whate whatever , lemon .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the volume buttons could be lemons , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that amount , we've the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , we've what have we what have we rid of .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we got rid of the plastic .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "is it the rubber .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that , that was just about all .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we've , ease has certainly stayed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've saved quite bit because we've just got the push-button interface , which is by far the cheapest .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so in sense not having that , we've lost some lost something on the innovation side ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but so , we've got we got rid of the rubber case , but we've now we now got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that is like the most standard type of button .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so in terms of fanciness and fashionability , we're the same , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , we could put two again on them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and everything else has stayed the same , so , plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to use .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and what about the innovation ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'ve still got the kinetic energy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you think .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the speech feature .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the speech feature .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then , the corporate identity .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we've cut just about the same .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we've lost hasn't it it's hard to tell how the rubber casing would really affect but more the features of the actual control will be more important than the actual aesthetics , but either way , we've made it fairly close to what just the company logo .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "how it would play out , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "whether that's considered to be part of the corporate identity , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't see how we could make it any more .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "apart from doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue , like the casing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but then what colour would you make the r_s ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so there's like set design which we get printed off .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you've got the company logo on there , which would effectively be stick-on badge .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you're in sense , you're comparing the product without the company logo .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then but you've got the space for it to stick it on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what what's the company colour ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "did you get told what the company colour is or .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'm still not quite we've established that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , we got the logo off the web browser .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but in the sense that , as you saw with the windows logo badge , it doesn't really matter .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's virtually the way that you frame , the windows badge on there , it really doesn't matter what colour it is , so long as our company's logo is framed in the same way as that with like black outline .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "fact , they've got black and white or black and silver .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , even if you had silver the same colour of silver on your display , because you've got effectively double edging on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's actually quite sneaky way of doing it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause you've got we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you could put in another , in this one , you've actually got three colours of buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or would that be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we decided that the blue ones were the standard colour .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you were talking about we're assuming the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which may or may not be the case .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "shall we save the point two for profitability then ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we've for the one they're gonna see all the time , we make it look good , and , fit the idea of what they want .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "bu but was the was there not button that you were thinking of on the other opt , on the second page , as it were , that you were thinking of having as different colour ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't think they would really need to be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if they were just all small round blue buttons , it'd be fine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "needs to be an enter button , but could just be the same as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then for the more functional buttons , we don't worry too much about that and just have that as like plus it's hidden away anyway , you're not gonna see it at the start .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's the thing that , you wanna pick up the controller and just hit button quickly to change the channel or volume .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , if it's dead obvious , then that's fine .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning , then you're paying bit more attention .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it may be different colour buttons isn't so important .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we just add that to profitability in effect .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , so we've dropped the cost , but same function ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we're meant to finish up in five minutes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just made load of money .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "shouldn't we lose point on fashion , go to three ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause we've lost the overall spongy feel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause it doesn't seem that it just hasn't changed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we said that because you got rid of the rubber , we put an extra fruit shape on one of the buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "le lemon sh , we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "did we decide what that was , which button it was ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on the volume ones ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "definitely lemon shaped .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "did you have to have rubber case , though , for rubber buttons ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or was it the other way around ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we can we're .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we're this way around .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that so we've saved two euros on that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "until the design team comes in and says , get off .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but you are the design team .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we say it's fine , so it's all good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so what bit are we on to ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can check if that's cherry or an apple ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "did we decide against the apple because of apple mac ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and did we make it cherry officially ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such like .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "drats , i've botched that , haven't .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so were we aiming for certain target on that scale ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we're aiming for one for all of them .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it really has to fit into the budget , so we just have to adjust things to get it in the which is fair enough .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we seem to have least something in each criteria .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we haven't completely left anything out , so as an overall product which has to be quite cheap , we've just about achieved everything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so do we have anything else to discuss ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what's on the agenda ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what's happened here ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we got so we've done the finance bit and the excel project and the we've done the redesign .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've got the closing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we're now on to project process .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now satisfaction with , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , we're actually now , in sense , on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is my understanding of it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what did you and remembering that nobody's just over the curtain .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , so suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , which will do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "finish your meeting now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we should just go through this quickly and then , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , have to finish that page .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", so project evaluation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , creativity .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did you feel you got chance to express yourselves enough ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "some of the divisions though between the individual meetings were bit arbitrary .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how do you mean ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we were finding out various things in be in-between the meetings , and they didn't the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one , we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons , and don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in you on your own .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the only thing you find is in manufacturing process , you would normally , you go to meeting , you decide , you do this , you do that , you do that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you'd probably present it at one like that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then you go away .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you find out information .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you then come back .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you then discuss it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you then go and change things around , and then go back .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so whereas , this time , you're really getting it from database source , so it's not anyway , so , what do you want to put down ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time and then diff things will be relevant .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i've put , seemed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "creativity , seemed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "flow of information on any given subject sometimes disjointed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it could have been slightly more creative project .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "remote control isn't the most fancy thing that you could imagine designing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the thing itself .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "have could have used different example pel to increase create creativity .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'t think of better example at the minute .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is this go it kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you have to do it within set time frame is the other thing , so but the other thing is that they're i'm guessing that they're trying to use this software to demonstrate how you could do project .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but think like it was bit restrictive just to say that you have to design television remote control , in way .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it depends what business you're in , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this one seems .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "from the website it looks it's quite innovative , but we're coming up with some bucket shop product aren't we that's , fifteen quid .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one of those things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like , companies can have like range of products and how it works but that something got sent out and have like brief to .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my wife at the moment , is acting as computer for you normally , you got problem , so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what she's doing is she's having to spend day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can ask whatever question .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then you or the idea is that the whichever person's at the other end can point them in the direction , show them where to either give them directly give them help , or secondly , point them in the direction , either at the library , or come back , or go and see joe bloggs , or whatever .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , and that was project suspect similar to this , because they were actually trying to debug the computer software to enable it to work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and , you had the machine crashing and various things going wrong .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "sh we look at the last slide , see if it's got anything else .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so alright , so we've got new ideas found , did we find any , no .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's one more to go .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you look at their products on their website here , real reaction , it's all pretty high-tech and cutting edge .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it was quite good with this the white board , having that and the digital pens .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like , that's something that made it little easier .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "leadership , teamwork .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we did find new idea , kinetic remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i've never seen one of them before .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "does you've got voice recognition computers , that's not remote controls .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "voice recognition , especially not could .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "t's different application of it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's just like the same products , but just put together in different way .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so how do you reckon teamwork went ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we all had separate ideas and then discussed them .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that went , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to go reasonably .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't think the budget allowed us to do anything , don't fitted in with the rest of their products .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they've got all these , high definition d_v_d_ and portable seven inch lightweight computer screens , and i'm thinking , do , one cheap remote control doesn't really fit in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "surely they should produ .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , we're meant to comment on leadership and the means , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "leadership's bit of funny one , isn't it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and new ideas found was the other thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we can't really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the project manager .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you were the leader .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so our experience of leadership wasn't really as much as yours .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now , i'd much rather be in marketing but certainly didn't get this computer to work as would have liked .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "however , alright means , so whiteboard so really , it's equipment .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "comput computers could be bit difficult at times but there's little chi there's little chip , you must plug it
