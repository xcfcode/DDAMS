{"text": "we will , so will be able to summarize our meeting , but still it would be in very important if the as main designer .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we can put on the here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we designed the two items .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes but we yes , we should phone him .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can we have phone , can someone it's really designed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when he is not here we will just we just have to continue .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so just for record will take notes again .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and first thing was got an email from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the twelve euro and fifty cents .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's he said to me when you stay in it's good , when you don't stay in you have to redesign .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there is no negotiation possible in this matter .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we have to consider that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so anna , you can have your presentation .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can't no we can't do evaluation 'til we have design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you are here .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ma then you can start now with presenting your designs .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so will start by the basic one that fits into eight euros actually , seven eight euros , and first for both they have special shape , the designer can explain better than me , but it's like surf board .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you are supposed to surf to browse to surf t_v_ , the web , and it's interesting shape because unconsciously people want to surf when they see this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also it's not too far from mobile .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so people are used to that shape , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't take care too much about the colour because we don't take .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "now we are supposed to give some oper offers now .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so here would be the infrared led l_a_ l_e_d_ , the on-off button , in red .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "here would be the volume .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on the left , so easy to turn on and off .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so this is very cheap version so there are you can carry on matthew .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also so you have browsing the channels , actually so you can go up and down the channels , if you have video you can forward , back .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "how can you change from v_c_r_ to t_v_ , by the way ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , this is single this is model with just the t_v_ one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no just , this is standard t_v_ one , we are not talking about that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the extra two are for having or giving an option for having more than one channel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the other one is for the teletext you want to browse through from that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's very basic remote then , it's only .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's very basic minimal thing which you can which is also available in the market , actually that's what it that it and would cost us to build it about eight euros .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "seven , eight , ei eight euros .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "exce except for the special shape , the surfing board , it has quite conventional layout of buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this one model and .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like the volume control , that's good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is magic one but know we don't want to talk about that , like it is very futuristic , it's like brain machine interface and all this we are thinking about in the future , it can come .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it doesn't actually have buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that then what we look .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "did you wanna see ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no you can carry on , look how it feels all .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is model , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes it really feels like mobile phone .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just i'm really want to talk to it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it won't talk back .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so but continue with your .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so then the this is the more little smooth and it gives lot of functionality , in this way , so all we have you see there are only six keys , but don't worry they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and so they have more space actually and it's easy to use this and you have so this is standard infrared eye , and then you have power button , which volume , what you have , and then other than that you have channel up and down and slow pause or slow lo pause or stop , and then you can you have display , here and this is functional thing which can change like it's toggle switch which could change the function say , you press it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "play , pause .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "from d_v_d_ player to television .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "really can change it , so instead of having many switches , the can display what is that on that , and you can have integrated microphone over here , or in the button here , so which can you want to do speech recognition and that channel lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the on your display .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to audio and to video on demand .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes and then you get feedback via the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is the orange button , the microphone .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and here is small l_e_d_ which is like blinking one , which tells you like are you running out of the battery , and which is can be useful for the locating as was talking earlier .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then we have cover , you don't need much of the time this , when you need you can use it , and this gives additional functionality that tomorrow you want you can add tactile thing to this cover .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "crazy dis designer , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but in there when this is closed , will it also cover up the screen ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's to do that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the screen is very an eye-attracting feature which shouldn't be that that's true .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "actually when you are watching the t_v_ , when you are watching anything or listening to them , you hardly care about what is getting displayed here , you want to and this gives protection to the actually , giving cover to that actually .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "gives protection because when it falls down it is it gives protec it's more robust that way .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , more robust .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and you have very good chances .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's low weight .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you have to see the components we put inside is very low weight .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so the cost is actually bit more , it's sixteen francs .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it sixteen euros .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's outside the budget then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then it's out of budget .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the main point we talk about that with our manufacturer .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and they say that the s_r_ system would be something like three francs per item so three euros .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and no , part of that , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's on top of the sixteen , or is it part of that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "part of that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that takes it down to thirteen euros without the speech recognition .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you we can have if you have new more ideas we can add new more some more keys if you want to it should not be cluttering up everything .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we should stick with number of keys because if we add too much then it's too locati .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what's this one on the side ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's for the it's l_e_d_ for indicating your battery and as it's like blinking one you can keep it aside .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like the shape of them , do like the size and the shape .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "be before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible , anna you can give our give us your yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we run the evaluation on both of the products , both of these two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "evalua evaluation and also the evaluation criteria , so what is important to look at .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is what we've talked about already , from the marketing point of view .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we just wanna make that we've taken into account .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just do it quickly if we al already .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's just shortlist of criteria on the things that we've identified as being important to selling the product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we just go through these and rate them as group and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that , so just average the score of those items , so these are the things we identified as being important .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the three things were look and feel , innovation and ease of use , were the three important components appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the way to appeal to our demographic .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then goin following the company motto , following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so do you wanna go through and put through those on the two products now or do we wanna discuss them further and then evaluate them ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no why not discuss it now , my personal view is when this one is eight euros we must think how can we improve it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so just go through onto the whiteboard .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not how this is gonna come out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the first one was really very far below budget , would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have the high profit on it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause if we're only going to make it for eight euros then we have .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then you must just see it we can still spend this four and half euro and to because the selling price is already prite fik quite fixed on twenty five euros so we just have to offer as much as value for the customer he can have for twenty five euro .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so look and feel , innovation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and now it easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "easy to use .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you following the idea of using the removable covers on these ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is that part of both of them or ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can still discuss that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , and together with evaluating this we might come with new ideas adding things or removing of options because they are too expensive , but i've received framework which we can do this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "did you have this excel sheet ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , this is these are the latest prices of our production unit for several components , so we can see whether the price is within the twelve euro fifty cents .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we can start with this , calling this one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's the pink .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is the first design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the other one's green .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so look and feel ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "where one is i've broken the pen again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there is another pen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "get that one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one's bad and seven's the best .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one's true and seven's false .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one's the best .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so on scale of one to seven ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "look and feel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you already feel that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "in my opinion purely feel is very good , is very good in your hand , so would consider two or may even one for feel .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that's just half , we should also consider look , and then it looks quite conventional .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't you agree ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "on the scale it's between functional and fancy we're looking at , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ma say five it's my opinion , but what four , four .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "will give it we have anyways the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it though the look is fine but still will give four in that case .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now we then we settle on four .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "can you fix the other , try it , just try it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you press like this not like this then you but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no that's the ink's dried .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "can you get the batteries ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no the battery has fallen down , that's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "battery's low , isn't it the ink ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the that's the that one ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no it's not that , it's how to close battery .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now it should be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no it's lost battery .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no it's it would still write but it wouldn't pick it up with the sensors .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it will not ri , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is there another battery there ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you got second ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "won't be able to tell .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , it has .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that working ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "did it come out ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working , it's just normal whiteboard marker but it wouldn't be picked up on the actual whiteboard .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the other one ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's slightly better , it's hard to tell from just the plasticine , but .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "when we want to include i'm doubting about this component .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it breaks in your , yes see , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's not button it's led , it's ac actually it should be embedded .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no actually this is not going to protrude actually , it it's it is jus it's led actually which 'll be covering in curve it's will be embedded there so it won't be really protruding .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you can push it again , you can push it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the other thing is , is the left hand one protruding ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand , it won't work so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no you it not protruding actually , it will go in better into that it's fine .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "i'd say two or three for that one , personally .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "probably more towards three than two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the look is better but the feel is worse .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so would also say this is four .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but do you what do you think ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my just that the feel is that you now you don't see the feel because if you press it quite inside now like this , now it's embedded one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "this is how embedded one will .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , it is the same shape .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's bas the same thing actually .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you will be except that in this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the makes it better .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and you might have slight thing for to forward and , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so will say two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's definitely more fancier than that one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would say two , three .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , consensus ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "two or three ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "two's good yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "looking like no but except for the design of the surf .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the first one , not really muc .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the surf design .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what features are we actually including ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you should be rea no it's more of the feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "are we including like location thing like trying to find it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there's nothing like that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but is there any there's no actual innovation in that , it's just straight-out remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the only innova innovation is the shape .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "say about that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so there's no this look and feel thing , though that's not technological innovation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so i'd be up for seven for innovation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the second one is really state of the art , in terms of innovation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and with many more functionalities , and can open and close the bottom part .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it gives it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the screen is that's t's quite innovative .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and all the scrolling buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "could put it at one or two would say .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so what is it , what are the innovations with this ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "got the screen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "automatic speech recognition .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "is that in this one though ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is this 'cause this is the there were different options we discussed then , we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , we ha , eight euros .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we just diske discuss it as you designed it and then we will try to get it in the budget .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the cost for these were what was the cost for the first one ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually we have to check again .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and this one was sixteen euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "innovation for this one is two ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's two , would say two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "un to be one what would do we nee actually , don't see , one would be without buttons , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "why it is one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the speech recognition is very good innovation believe it , so give it one ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can put one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is it with the speech recognition ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's using speech recognition , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "gi given that it works , then it's one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ease of use ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "he is used to it act they are used to it actually .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the first one is really standard , so everybody including our grandmothers can use it , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so that's two for ease of use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "here there may , though it has more functionality it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the other one is quite easy , tho though .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it shouldn't be diffi , actually it will be but have reduced the keys actually you see .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so three or four .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one me we hope sometimes people get scared with the number of buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and there is like would say three .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "three or four ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "three , would .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "three is fine with me .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because it's not like big one with one hundred buttons or so , this one would be for grandmothers .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's actually the user has to put some effort to do use that actually , it's not so easy , like this one the normal .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes but then when he is used to it , it is quite easy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is quite easy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so three is good .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "initially there is lot of effort , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what's the next ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so three's how goes to the target demographic .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're still thinking twenty to forty year olds ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so twe twenty to forty , yes that's .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , this would give this model to the old people actually .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so sh completely changed our demographic there , it's not part of the funky young thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "exce except for the surfing shape .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's something which has an appeal on this group , but we after this we can consider , making this more attractive to the demographic .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then imagine it being applying to the demographic .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's it's still ye .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause we have got room , we've got some budget there to add few things to it , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but as it is now , would say , six , something .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "do you agree ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because it's so important it's it was written that it really so important , the look and taking care of its it targets , the range of people , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if you sell it in the market it's going to be cheap , actually .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's going to be cheap whatever though , it was set with we've got set price .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so and people can still decide to use the cheaper one instead of .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but for us it's we have constraint that we need to sell at twenty five euros .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's nothing that would make me spend an extra few euros on that one rather than another one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ju just think , twenty five euros , it's not going to be cheaper .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so in that case t's fine then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and the demokraphi demographic of the second one ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the demographics of it's it has more market actually .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's got the toys in it , it's got the screen and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "tha that's it's better , because of the screen which is really an appeal on the and on the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if you want to target if we wish to sell four millions of this , for this audience we need the screen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , the screen attracts , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because it , ma that's something to consider , yes , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "especially if we're gonna have an screen on low range product then that's good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "wh what no say two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'd probably go with three again for that one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or even one and two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , two , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because tomorrow this will be more appealing because you can add lot of sophistication on that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "because then you have it you have lot of things which you can include for the people to we have to practically test it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and especially 'cause this has the speech recognition as , and that makes it more appealing , it's more of new fun toy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the field test will tell you how good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the final point , trends .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and following the trends .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so as it is , not really doing either of them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "spongy , that means that it goes in the water .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the spongy could be part of the feel of the buttons as , know some have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons and not exactly spongy but i'm thinking one of the nokias that's got like you ca it hasn't got individual buttons it's got just one bit on it and so you can that feels kinda spongy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but this one includes this feature , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we , it's the way they are going to be , actually .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it's , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the in the colour we can make it fruit and veggie .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that's if you're using the covers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the then we can al yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or is it just one they make it for mobiles , it can't be that much more complicated .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can consider is it possible do you think , to make cover for such phone ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "just with the flexible plastic or just two things which can be put on each other .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but why do you want to cover that actually ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "in that in the mod are you ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you got the option of having different colours or different textures .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is possible .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "exactly like nokia phones .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , exactly like it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we can but we have to decide it , we can put the fancy look of vegetables , to these covers and now try to invest in the features .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the if we do the cover that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in electronics , it lets people have the latest fashion even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out , you'll still be able to put new cover on it and then it'll still be in fashion .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'cause sometimes look at this computer , this laptop , it's all black , and it's quite conventional , and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we could do like in the range the set of what we propose black one , very standard one , that meets the requirements of such people that want really standard things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then you have the option of having the different colours , different covers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that would make the trends equal , so we really have don't have , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "'cause that's the feature that could be included in either of them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "although it is more with the spongy buttons on the other one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so point better for the number two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "two and three , or one and two ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "say , say one and two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "one and two .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so le let's see .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this one has spongy but buttons ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it says one point six , one point eight .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the blue one spongy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "see , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the average of that is three six nine divided by five , so five nine by five , one point eight ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just add it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "three , six , seven .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this one , eleven thirteen nineteen twenty one , divided by five is four point two .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "four point two .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we still got very different price for those two so they're not really comparable yet anyway .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we must try to get them closer .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "both in or we just have to choose .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because , when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive and when we to for this one we have to make it more cheap .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "t's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that'll take us down to the budget .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , but i'm now did you work with the same prices that have here ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so give call with the manufacturer and explained them and they told me this could be possible for sixteen fr euros .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "unfortunately we didn't see this chip , matthew , so we have to recap with this one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "tha yes , re reconsider it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we ought to reconsider everything with this , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so let's try to model this phone in this sheet , what energy source we didn't speak about that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's normal battery , or yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it migh it it'll need more than conventional one , it won't be just you might use a_a_ battery actually .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what do you say , mael ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for this one it's normal battery .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "just so one battery .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "given speech recognition you should go for the less fancy chip .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "sample speaker , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , or sample sensor , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "sample , this one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , this one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "see double curve .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so which one are we talking to ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's are you talking about this or that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's gonna be more than just the biggest case , definitely .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "either of them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , we are talking about , but they have the same shape , but , actually bu so this would be double curves ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "they're both going to be not basic cases .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "plastic would be the material .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the basic one , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is it zero franc ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "special colour , now we leave it to the covers .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so now we're either going button or l_c_d_s , display .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , but now this is per unit , this number of components .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that price per unit , or for the whole thing ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it would need twelve buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we might need scroll wheel , for that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no but for this one it's twelve euro .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , for that one also .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "there are twelve ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so this comes to eighteen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that's without any special button supplements .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "one scroll wheel you might need .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so but do you agree that thi yes i'm no i'm not sh .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we'd have special colour , special form and special material on all of them .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they're not just standard buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "bad estimate , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "minute , it's not double curved , it's single curved , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because it's there is no like .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but it would be curved on two it's like it's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as , that's what .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "t's this curve like this so , it's there is only is there is nothing like in the other there are concave .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes kno undes understand what you mean , yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you talking about concave curves ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can put the single curved in the sixteen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you think single curved ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that makes seventeen .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and what are just the bt buttons , we have twelve buttons , are you ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have we haven't talk about , but that's no is very exp inexpensive believe but it is not in the list .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we have more , we've got those the scroll wheel on the side and the sc .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so had bad estimation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we've got scroll wheel for the volume don't we , or is it some other thing that's not on there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "ho is this scroll wheel or is this button which can be pressed on two sides so for higher and lower ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we've only got five minutes left so we need to wrap it up pretty fast .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "yes , scroll wheel .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this is even more than the cost you gave , the sixteen euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so based on that , where is the es sample speaker but still , it no we cannot , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that is the sample sensor and sample speaker .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we're we could go for the for simple chip , but then we can't have the speech recognition , yes ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we just need that actually .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we need one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so when we this would be cutting the speech recognition .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so but the but if you have the near the you can choose select between like uni universal between audio , t_v_ and v_c_r_ , and this needs advanced chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it it's going to be it's with the regular chip , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "transti say it's regular , regular chip , and we still on fifteen , so yes but that can just say one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or regular chip ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "regular , today we you can do that with regular chip .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and what about the number of buttons my matthew ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "when you look at this , this item , but you cannot make phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really low , no ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "ca we are just when we just want to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to fit in twelve fifty .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so is it possible ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but that's seven basic buttons , seven buttons without any adds-on , without special colours or form or material .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that'll be then we have to ask the user to press it several times .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , he .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the display is three francs , three euros , by itself .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we don't want to change that ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we really want other otherwise we wouldn not get the market .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or we could even replace them by buttons actually .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "otherwise you ha you have ve very normal thing like this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so twelve euro fifty , we got two off of the battery , we can't do anything about that , so ten fifty , if we want an dispra display , that's seven fifty , so we've got seven fifty to use for the case and for the buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so wha what each of us think about the because it's measure point the , do you t's important ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and the chip .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the chip's up there already .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget , there's no doubt about that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because sometimes whe when you watch the t_v_ , you have big display and you don't need one more in your hands ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm just asking .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "actually it depends , it depends what functionalities you want to add into it , if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons , or and you'll have display which is that is going to bring the cost by two euros at least .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the display .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we can get rid of it and then add couple of buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but , do we want that ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "on the market point of view , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "what do you think , is major feature , or ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have to come to decision now , just we what we just do is vote about the display so yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for the price , it's gonna be what we can afford , and it's looking like we can't afford the display , there's no way we can get it in there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you assume , you want democratic voyt vote , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "one man one vote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so who thinks the disply display should be in it ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'd like it to be in but 't see it happening .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "'t see it fitting in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we need to be .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "bu you're power voter veto anyway as project manager .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "know , but yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "have to make decision now , that's it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so having an display is just have very limited amount of buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "is that acceptable ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "ca can have can the functions be implement in an you've you agree .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so hav having seven buttons , instead of twelve .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that wou would be cutting suh say about these buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because one show me that actually we could we move these three buttons and have three possibilities for each of the three here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "here one , at the middle , and at the bottom .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then we we're really losing ease of use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that will create another problem .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for the people to use it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's not going to be easy .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we should cut the screen .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that that's my opinion .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , it's , you cut the screen and introduce two more buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just where , l_c_ we now we can just yes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so l_c_d_'s out , is speech rec out now ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the speech recognition is out .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because of the budget , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so are we back to the original one now , back to the first version ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which turns out to be on budget exactly , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "with these new costings .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so just look at forget that one and look at that one now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we just go for this one and that now twelve euros is the price , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "actually , we will not need the really expert designers because the amount , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we can go back and talk to the suppliers and see if we can drive the prices down to add few more things in but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "then we the same .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that was it .", "speaker": "B"}], "id": "xxxxx", "relations": [{"y": 1, "x": 0, "type": "Explanation"}]}]
