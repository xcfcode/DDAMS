now for real reaction , this is so it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're gonna just do quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another then we're gonna start talk little bit about tool training .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet , the whiteboard .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've got general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just bit of discussion close up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "game in real life so want to i'm just gonna you got you can discuss that , i'm thinking about proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask , don't tell .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so if you say something about marketing , sorted , is exactly .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you're just gonna believe me , we'll go from there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "obvi if you if at the same time if you like logically if something doesn't like if i'm like we're gonna sell remote control that's the size of this paper book you say like that doesn't seem like such good idea because of x_ go with it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll discuss it but i'm not gonna ask do that or it seems like exactly so , 'cause we're what we're role playing is you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "prove it , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and that's the same for your when we do introductions and you talk about your background have fun , you went to you're like in maine you went to u_c_s_b_ but you wanna say you went to harvard like that , why not , you can this is we can have little bit of fun with it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so are you with that does that seem logical ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "works for me .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that we're making remote control which is thrilling but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model if you had time to check the in real life if you checked the corporate website .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , that's the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary that nobody really thinks about and try to make it like john lewis or if you go to debenham's .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in user friendly slick sleek way .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "way we're gonna go about doing that is at first we're gonna start on the basics .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's where i'm gonna need you the user interface designers and the other designer that 't remember , the i_d_ and the u_i_d_ the industrial designer on alright , getting into it to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be you're you are the bottom you're like no you can't do that you can't have x_ and y_ at the same time .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there you go .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , like you probably got the same emails did but the idea of , yes coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so we'll work up from there and then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as the last stage where you build or tell me tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can hope for and what way to go take the basics and make it nicer and then ov the u_i_d_ and the i_d_ you can keep on the at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible to try of sync it all up .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's the detailed design .",

trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "this is what the finance department has told me , the c_f_o_ but , i'm not sold on this , it's pretty dear , twenty that's like forty bucks for remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it would have to like do my laundry for me .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what we can work on that later but we're gonna make lot on it , the profit aims to make fifty million euros on it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so one of the things was gonna mention to you the designers is that it we probably need rever it needs to be universal remote control probably .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so something that could do n_t_s_c_ as pal as various other formats like if it's gonna control d_v_d_s but i'll leave that to you but that's something that it is gonna be an international sold thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we wanna try to make hundred percent profit on it if we can .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so just to close up , i'm not how much time i've used next time project manager , sorted .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is we'll meet in another half an hour or so and i'd like the industrial designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "u_i_d_ you your assignments are up there and you'll also get assignments from in your email as more spec specifics on what do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "basic and so need you to tell us what we what the user's gonna want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what they're looking for .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so actually in way you in our next meeting chat bit about what the user's gonna want and what the user can have , like so is and we'll discuss the trade-offs in between so specific instructions will be sent in your email .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and negotiate that .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but that is more or less good place to start for now and as more things come up we'll have meetings and you'll get emails and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "any questions , before we get started ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "assume that we're building stand alone remote control , we can't build it into other products .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you mean to like .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like mobile phone like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't think there's any rules about it yet .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "our personal coach will have something to say about that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or can we produ can we sell remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have think about it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm certainly op it seems like it seems like it's certainly do-able isn't it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or if we can't have full mobile phone remote that has some other useful function .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , good idea , good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll see what like that .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "remote with changeable faces , like the faces that you can buy for phones .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like the little cover thingies .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's true , we probably have some time , we should brainstorm bit like what we wanna do , go back to don't really have any .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let me bring up something about our basic goals here , what we want to accomplish .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not so much .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "all we'll find them , we're on our own .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now are we also discussing our initial ideas here ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let's do it , let's do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does anybody have any initial ideas ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm gonna go ahead and take notes on this too 'cause .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "start your minutes .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "t's given it's gonna be universal , we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things , as soon as you said that was thinking like all the other things you could get remote to do , like your microwave or your front door or like to have everything on one thing , but then , i've never been fan of those huge remotes that have like million buttons , you can't tell what they do .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so initial ideas .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but i'm thinking p_d_a_ design so touch screen design rather than button so that you can flip around all sorts of different things .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that'd be different .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that's slick isn't it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like stylist like just .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we got five minutes more to chat about this , perfect .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we've got this an idea of trade-off between size and functionality .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we also i'm also gonna note for future reference this idea of so you like an l_ like touch screen type of remote ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we want it to be munt multifunctional but at the same time if you get it to do too much you're not gonna be able to tell them apart , that whole .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's gonna be too complicated , too crowded with buttons and things .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't think one exists .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "an interesting option .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "be good idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "needs it needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the other remotes .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "all the other universal remotes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if there's such thing out there , we could do some research on or one of us could do some research on it about whether or not there are multi-format like pal , n_t_s_c_ , region one .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm pretty there is .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have friend who has p_d_a_ that he just points at his telev any television he wants and it'll figure out the specifications of it and will control it so assume that can be done with around the world .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "li i'm liking that idea , this idea of touch screen remote with multi-format features .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "making it out of material would be very important , because so many of those remotes that you see , these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "keeping it and slick , would be important .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and , like , there's such problem with losing them , that adding this whole like p_d_a_ pen business is only one more thing to lose , so we're gonna have to be careful with what like just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this but that would be really .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like the idea of the multi plate .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "fi like what are they called , those face plate things ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "isn't there name for them ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "think they're just called face plates ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "something , we'll have to come up with name , patent it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we should come up with fuzzy one as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "for those cold winter days .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it wouldn't be such bad idea to have like locator device , simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if we're bundling it unless we're selling their telly with the remote .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "cou could we not do something where like just little lit like literally just very small thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we bundle it as phone then you can always call it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you're not doing that then we can have something that just rings from either there used to be those whistling devices but that's little bit annoying .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "kinda like how on lot of cordless regular phones , you have page button and it goes , could we do something like that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we could design into that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this material quality as like what we can think about what apple 's been really successful with this surgical white business or this sleek .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years , very much so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we do have the minimum am amount we were talking finances , selling forty pound remote would or forty dollar remote , twenty five euro remote would be pretty it's pretty expensive so we might wanna trade off some of the features for lower price .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "without getting into that whole like go down to bargain store remote bargain store universal remote that's black and massive , some balance there in somewhere .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but have think about what we can do , have think about what we want to do , how we're gonna sell it and .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or if you our users in mind , like these grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design , no it's they're used to the buttons so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to , and who we're gonna be able to get it out of .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're talking twenty five pounds or twenty five euros ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "twenty five euros .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they're all weaker than they're all stronger than the dollar .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "although , computer parts , all if you're gonna upgrade your computer , buy it in the states .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like do you know fry's ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "huge computer electronics store ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they serve they sa tha they will sell things overseas so you can buy in america and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty pounds about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now , i'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the project documents , so if you wa need reminder about what we've talked about the different trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas , you can consult them at your leisure .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so for that
