time , just twenty-five minutes to discuss about this project and the project initiation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "first of all want to ask mister ed about your marketing plan and your product plan and but do you already have like functional design or technical design or for the moment not yet , but what's your do you have some project plan , something with you or .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that we'll see that throughout the day in how we're going to put this together as marketing to market the product .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we'll have to see on through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from with this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for the moment not yet .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , this is like said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we'll have to simply we'll have to work on it together .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so by when you think you can give me some project

project ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what is the goal of the project ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the goal of the project i'll hand out to the ed , so to explain what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'm in the sales i'm supposed to explain them what to do .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we have to define exactly what our product is , from what had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee , is that ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , so can you explain what exactly the product is ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if i'm not wrong , we're making the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "remote controls , 'cause had two different things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "had first part of mine was to make remote control for new remote control for television , and afterward had discussion about coffee so we'll start with the remote control for television then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we're have to design something that is very user friendly .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "something visual that has something that will draw people to buy the product , because everybody's experienced with remote controls , and some remote controls are worth throwing out the window .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "most of them ar we're have to come up with new idea on how to make it lot easier to use , 'cause lot of times spend half day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and what abo christine , what about your the industrial design plan ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are you have design already on this product or you're still working on the design ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , have not begun working on the design , and actually didn't know we were designing remote control , we were designing new monitor .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the website went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of some seven inch monitor , and understood that was the project goal .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i'm glad didn't do any work ahead of time because clearly didn't understand the project goal .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "did see that we were starting new project together and there was going to be four member team composed of these people , and that's about that's and read through the different steps , and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team , for the design ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for the industrial design ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would think that depends on how much money you give us .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's , but before we talk about the finance , do you have some idea how we can sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and it's to the individual also .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because , you can make it you have different choices with different financial models .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", think that in general you have to do you have to have something that's very fashionable , that's very attractive that people see and recognize its goal , and they immediately wanna have it have one of their own .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it would really would need to something like the ipod would be good , seems to have caught on fairly , so , don't care what it does , just so it looks .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but when you think you can give me like design on the functional design or the technical design ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i've got lot of other projects i'm doing now and so i'll have to and see how those go .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if they go quickly then it could be month .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if run into any problems in my other projects it might be six months .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but need something in the writing , so like what's your functional design , what's your technical design , and how many people you need for this project , and what's the time frame you're looking , and what is the budget , initial budget you're looking , and how is going to the market , so you've had to meet with the marketing team and how they're going to market and what are the marketing strategic plan , when are you going to introduce , and by the time you introduce the product and there would be competition , so need some the plan in the writing from you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and it's po as soon as possible .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and when would you like that ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if we have enough time then do you think two weeks is close enough ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes that would be good , because need to go to the management and tell them what we are going to do , and what cost is , and what's the time frame and what's the project plan , because without any documentations , not go to the management and say , so we are going to do this and we need this much money , so then it's difficult for me to say , that's the reason need some plan from you , initially , then we can have the further discussion again .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are there other people who will be contributing to the plan ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , if you need some help , so let me know .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , who are the people you need from the marketing or the technical side or the administration point of view , to add in any documentation , or some technical point of view , so just let me know so coordinate all the teams .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "i'll get back to you on that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and ed so what's what do you think about this project for the remote control and do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or the sales strategy ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not yet other than doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do , what they're building , their designs , their ideas , also have to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it should be fairly large market because the number of people that the competition , agree it has to be something it has to be something new , it has to be something that draws people saying , like this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "whether it works or not , they have to first say like this , like the design , and then it's gotta be simple to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , so what prefer you need to interact more with the christine , because what she is going to do it , and how to sell it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because she is doing the design , but you are the core because you are in the marketing , so because you need to sell and you're the responsible for the all the money , the finance , tomorrow .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , what prefer , so you need to interact with the christine more and within her team , who is using the functional design or technical design , and you need to come up with some plan , how we are going to do the your sales plan , that that's yes , that's you have to decide , so the best thing is you both of the christine and you discuss with yourself , and come up with the cost , and how we are going to compete in the market , in the technically , or in the sales wise , the commercial wise , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do we already have cost limit on this , an idea of how much we want to market this for , how much it's gonna sell for , that's up to us to decide , ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then we have to design , how long it will take the whole project , how much is going to cost us , and how much we are going to benefit for the company .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's of benefit for everybody individually .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's if we can give me some your the sales plan , including the technical what she's going to talk to you within the team , then it will help me to discuss with the management for further , and put it in the proper project plan .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if you need any coordination in between compared to the some technical vendors or commercial vendors , depends if you want to have some marketing plan or technical plan , so you let me know .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "coordinate , or , you are my coordinator , am ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "between all the coor .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , not exactly .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "my job from what understood was to look at the usability requirements and make that the product is usable , it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so i'll have to interact with christine and discuss with her , so that she's not designing something that my studies will show off the bat that it's not going to work , and so it's loop that feeds in , but don't think necessarily that i'm in coordinating position for it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "which is yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you need to interact with christine more , for the user acceptability , and the testing , then you will yes .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which will also feed into the marketing , because depending on what users want , depends on how you sell it , what tag lines you attach to it , how you try to make it more attractive to users .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so all three groups will need to interact quite bit .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then build the plan based on all of that , because you need to take all the factors into account .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but what request , keep ed in the loop , in between your meeting and christine meeting , because he should 's happening .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can c_c_ him on any discussions or documents that are passed around .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and copy all the mails , all the discussions to me , so need to submit to the management .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so any questions for time being ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design , or .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "to come up with the functional design and to discuss with ed , and how it's going to be work , and first of all with your user acceptance , how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market , so then we can discuss about further things .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , we'll meet when the we'll discuss on the further meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "would you mind at the conclusion of our meeting could you send us copy of your slides ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "yes , will .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", that would be useful .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll copy , le let us keep all the emails and all the copies , share each other , so everybody what's happening , ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and if anything you need anytime so either you can call me , or just send me email , or just come and knock my door , so i'm available here .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for coming and wish you time then .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "see you later .", "speaker": "A"}], "id": "xxxxx", "relations": [{"y":
