"speaker": "A"}, {"text": "is everyone ready ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we can hold on for minute .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's the spam that everybody likes to receive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "are you ready ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", take it that you are all ready now .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alright first off we'll just recap from our last meeting .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which was we got together just to decide on to talk about what it is that we were actually supposed to be doing , and who we all are and like that , get bit more of an idea together of what's going on .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is now that we it is that we are doing , now we know that it's t_v_ remote and you have just been off doing some and d_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , see i'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're gonna hear your three little presentations , whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you have any preference of order ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'd like to hear i'd like to hear who's on the from catherine actually first .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "want what i'd like to hear about is if we've finally decided on what energy we're gonna be using and it's just that , let's hear from you first .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "she is still finishing her .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , it's fine i'm just preparing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "where is that thing ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's is it like crank thing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "would that work ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "get yourself in position .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's me again .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so for the energy sources we can have basic battery , hand dynamo which is which was used in the fifties for torches , if you remember that which wouldn't be , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't think any of us remember the fifties .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it wouldn't be very fancy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can have kinetic provision of energy , which is used on some watches these days .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if you have just bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "or you can use solar cells , but i'm not about that indoors , really , but .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "there's sometimes combinations , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from light bulb ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "does anybody know ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it has to be on the solar energy , but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "think the what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if we want something fancier , the kinetic provision of energy could be , but if it's worth the cost .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we've got to discuss that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for the case of the remotes itself , they can be general case , which is just flat one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can have curved one or double curved one , if what , so , more ergonomic , that suits the palm of your hand , that thing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what's double curved one ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so then the case material itself , so it can be either plastic or latex , rubber , wood , or titanium .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and for each of them you have cases where titanium , you can't use it for if you if we're choosing double curved case , we can't choose titanium .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if we are choosing solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material , so we just have to take that into account .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and we discussed earlier on the problem thing , so we could .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so that might be an idea of using the rubber , but then it should , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's have squeezable remote .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and also it doesn't break as easily , so rubber would be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "when t_v_ programme's got one watching the match and your team's just lost , you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like that idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "rubber's but after my fashion thing , you'll realise that rubber is more people .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "rubber , we're all going we're all liking that idea ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you think you can market that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we like rubber , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then there are the push-buttons , so you can have basic push-buttons or scroll-wheels , like you have on mouse , or you could have , which gives you display .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "scroll buttons , as .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if you use rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it's constraint .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we're gonna go with we've decided that it's gonna be rubber case so push buttons instead of the wheel ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but is it double curved one or not ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it's not double curved , then we've got the choice for the push-buttons , if it's double curve , we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if that makes sense .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if it's rubber , isn't it malleable anyway , it doesn't matter if it's double isn't rubber case , mean it's completely flexed , it flexes to whatever they want it to ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "mean so what's the difference between normal rubber case and rubble doub double rubber double curved case ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , but na le you see , you've got , the energy that's one thing , then you have the case is , whether it's flat or curved .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'll have big mac , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that's we don't care if it's rub rubber or not , but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat , single curved or double curved .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and i'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go why , but we need to go for rubber push-buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , either we just need to decide on the case .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let's have rubber push buttons , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "go rubber the whole way .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let's go crazy .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and then , do have last slide ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , do .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the price that go with it , so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we get scroll-wheel , that's higher price range .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if we get an advanced chip which is used for the , the display thing , then that's even more expensive .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "chip on print .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what i'm not understanding here is , advanced chip on print , which presume is like one p_c_b_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the infra-red sender ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what alternatives do we have to that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if it's not chip on print then , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's less expensive technically speaking , it's not as advanced , but it does the job , too .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it sounds so , why would we not go for that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if it's something that's inside the unit .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "fo it doesn't , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we wanna go for an all so long as it works , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so let's not go for the , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so let's not bother with the chip on print .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it's either the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what about the just developed sample sensor ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what about what ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "t'd be it'd be , but they are saying they've just developed it , i'm just guessing .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "what do we need speaker for in remote control unit ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the speech recognition option is it doesn't seem really very promising for us , 'cause the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine , where , you can program sample wi that when you say something it will give response , and you program the response as .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's not something that we wanna go into with this product .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just clips of tha that you record yourself .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so you can program your coffee-maker that when you say , good morning , to it says , hello rick , or whatever .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , it's not it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the t_v_ on like , turn the t_v_ on , and turns comes on , but it's not that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it just gives you it just gives you verbal response .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it just gives an answer .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , like what's the point of saying , hello remote , hello , how are you ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then it was when they said when they said , voice recognition , they meant like , channel five , and it will change .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "just if you are really lonely , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you're really lonely , it is it's no , tha that would be more promising .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and then it switches on .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "like you talk to it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "can have channel five ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it it's just remote that talks to you .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "then forget about it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "to certain cues .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i'll go back , to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so for the energy source , do we go for the battery or the cheaper option .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "i'm fine with the basic battery .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's cheap , it's cheerful , it's worked , does work .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "are you happy with that ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we'll go for the battery .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we were go we were going with the late with the r_s_i_ rubber , weren't we ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we want it rub rubber double curved .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the double whopper , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so it will look like something like this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so then if we use double curved case , then we have to choose rubber push-buttons , and that's fine ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we're going for the simple buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so rubber keys , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it's cheapest all round , it sounds kinda funky , and we can also market it as 'cause we were saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that the people have the people were getting the complaining about r_s_i_ , and this is anti-r_s_i_ .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that's another marketing point that we can use .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the rubber push-buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "don't you have to move your .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but anything is gonna have buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "even if it's jog wheel , it's still repetitive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they would give an option of flat buttons or that they don't .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you see , you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing button or pressing flat bit of screen .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not actually what you are doing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the fact that this rubber is actually used in these anti-r_s_i_ ps specific .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the rubber's good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're giving them way to burn off steam , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so they can sit there and go like .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "not that watching t_v_ should be that stressful .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "t_v_ can be stressful , if you're watching sports .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "alright , that's me done .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "let's hear from you about the it's the interface .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "some of what have to say ties into what catherine was just talking about .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so i'm continuing with the user interface topic .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so consulted with our manufacturing division .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it sounded like catherine was also speaking with them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "also took reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration , 'cause that's crucial as far as what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and how they're laid out .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so the manufacturing division sent some samples of interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , like the coffee machine .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so already mentioned the speech recognition interface .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we vetoed that idea .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's just sample sensor sample output .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the t_v_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , they also give the they suggested the idea of using spinning wheel like you use on the side of an m_p_ three player like ipod .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so we've already addressed that and that would actually be worse like r_s_i_ you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that does get annoying .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the other suggestion , and have feeling that we're interested in something more general , but they suggested , going little bit into niche , like either gearing our remote towards kids , where you could have lot of colours , the keys might be , funny or , or something for the elderly , where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only few buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we can discuss this , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , the key layout and design are really crucial .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you don't want you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use lot without always pressing the wrong one .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and didn't mention that we need power button in our last give you an example here of , good layout and bad layout from our manufacturing department .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have v_ on both of them , so it's confusing for the user .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do we have an example of good one ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and for kids .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so , my personal preferences of we've all talked about and seemed to be on the same page .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so was against the speech recognition st going towards anything in niche sense .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it should be more general .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "didn't think the spinning-wheel or the l_c_ display were crucial for us .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and , that's it for me .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "let's so what are our definite decisions on this then as team ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the interface type we're going for just the simple straight set of buttons .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so we're not gonna have any display .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , it's just gonna be just gonna be push-buttons .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we shall have limited number of buttons , ideally , power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and numerical keypad .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and some it will either have lock button like we mentioned or cover like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's to the point where we need to decide about that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and we're not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "now that we've decided on our it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too gaudy , but , would say mayb couple of colours like black with yellow and somewhere , like the r_r_ can be yellow , like that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "are we gonna hav an are we have we decided on whether we're gonna supplement it with anything , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , we're not we're just gonna go we're .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "don't have any other questions on this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "let's move over to , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the fact also that we are having rubber case would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "'cause so if we wanna have lock of some sort it would have to be button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but that should be , speak with the button department , but that it should be easy to have button that just prevents the other buttons from operating .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the button that just does that , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so that should be simple .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm just letting what's happening in the markets and what the fashions are for next year .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so yes , so from looking at this year's trends and fashions and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market , we have found that for the remote control market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to which we've already probably discussed .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the most important aspect is look and feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so it has to be .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "why should people buy this when they're already got remote that came with the t_v_ ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "second , it should be technologically innovative .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so technologically it should be like work , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what's that mean ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it should work .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "should be it should be cutting edge in some sense , have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "should that's new .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now the trouble is we've already decided that we're going with the that works already , that's cheap .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "actually , these first two points we've already gone away from , 'cause our rubber one is not fancy it's different , but wouldn't say like rubber remote is fancy .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if that's what people want then we we're going in the wrong direction .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it's not technologically innovative either .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , no loose that's why was thinking , bluetooth , 'cause if you like put up bluetooth , and it's like bluetooth remote control , everybody's gonna like , 'cause bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is , like people and when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for , they don't really care whether , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we could , they do .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they do , but it's like it's not , but it looks good .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "one hundred per cent , that's your first thing , you go , i'm not gonna buy that , 'cause if it works or not .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if it looks good and it's it can just be there for decoration .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": ", what do you two think about this ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so is the advantage of bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other electronics ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but like you could always insert , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "what don't understand what , and it this is just gonna all this is being used for is your television .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's what it allows you to do , ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , people like , if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it would that would mean you'd need television that has bluetooth in it , which no television does , does it ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "bluetooth would , enable you , to connect you if you get call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs , you would get on your television you're being called by this person now .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "that would mean we'd have to make television as .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "things like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , that would be your telephone in with your television .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the that wouldn't be the remote so much , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , but if you get bluetooth on the remote , you'd be able to with the television , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and nah , the televi the television would have to be bluetooth compatible , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "was just trying to find an advantage .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "wha what advantage would you get for the kinetic mo provision of energy then .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it doesn't like it doesn't have to be , bluetooth , that was just an idea , but like it needs do something that , is new .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "an and there is no there is no such thing .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "whether it's battery it could be something really minor , like but we are really keeping to what is already out there , and people've already seen it , people've already got it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have and just go creative .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it's been done for watches , but haven't seen that for remotes , yet .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this that's very good .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and then you can market it .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "never have to change battery again .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "change the batteries ever again .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and this is all tying in very nicely .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the fact that it's made out of this rubber , we can throw it about .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about , because it charges itself up by doing it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", and in little characters you say , but not too much .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "yes , so can , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the generating like the energy generator .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but , by the squeezing it the , that's idea .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "third most important aspect is it's easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and we've all worked that out .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "we're all about that .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "in the fashion , how it's supposed to look .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "next year's fashion very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so next year people will be buying , found this really funny , strawberry shaped chairs , and things .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we could have keys that are like broccoli key and an avocado key on them .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "wanna watch the pineapple channel .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy , so it's not quite spongy , but spongy , would say is , so we're in .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "spongy , that's where .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we're ahead of the game there .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's for us .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and so personal what was just saying like move away from the current remote controls like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel , while still keeping to the company's image , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "had to say so we're moving in the direction like .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "alright , no , this is good , so through all that we've we go we're , we're gonna go back to going with the kinetic thing , that's , using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti-r_s_i_ you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself , you are charging the batteries , and i'm not about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how we incorporate we don't have to follow every trend , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "make it like fruity colours .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the power button could be like big apple .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but apple would sue you for that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "this is true .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "they don they don't own all images of apples .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "sued the beatles so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we'll make it pomegranate , big pomegranate .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally on is its image .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "like , we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables , but we dunno what it should be , or like are we going it looks slick , but what do we mean by
