[{"edus": [{"text": "so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , as the previous meeting will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so will first what ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no you do the minutes first , or ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "will let our user interface designer speak first , mister david jordan .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , we'll technical accessoire ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so first will present the concept of user interface .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's three concepts in the user interface .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so first one it's google controller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the second is fancy controller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the last one is intelligent controller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so there are three concepts in our controller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "next will explain one by one , the first is google controller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so it's combination of easy to use and sophisticated functions .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this is first concept of our controller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "the second concept is fancy controller , so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , they can easy recognise our controller among lot of products , so the user interface should be very cute , very attractive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "such like this , there are several examples in the slides .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "i'm not the one in the middle is very attractive .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's very , if you're .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's very big , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's hard it's easy for you to remember it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "or to recognise it , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we'll have big discussion suppose after that , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so the last concept is intelligent .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we want our controller to be smart , so we should use technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and gesture recognition .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "with this advanced features we can attract lot of user .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there this is the three concepts of our controller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , but as the expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap between channels .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so some time it's very convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "do you think they will be able to use gestures ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , they will get injuries because of that ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "or if you say channel three two three four six five , they will be bored after while .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you cannot find your controller , you can just speak something such as , one two .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's good point , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but suppose you got cold .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you have mute remote controller .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you can use your gesture .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's no problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "for limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but suppose you have family watching t_v_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you will work ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but this would never happen anyway .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they cannot speak at the same time .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but the but this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if you have one brother and one sister and they want to watch their favourite t_v_ programme , so they say channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the same can happen even with it this remote control because the .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's very interesting .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "don't , you mean it could be problem for this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you have the remote control , so you can keep it with you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you're not obliged to share it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "that's the advantage of intelligent controller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "even you have the controller , say channel three , so it's come to channel three , don't have to it's advantage .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's and mayb we can have the switching mode to pass from voice controller to manual controllers , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no , but this is disadvant disadvantage .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but one other question .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "how much will it cost ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , more expensive .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "because suppose we need to do research to have something working .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no we just are use no we just have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you use the basic but it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so you won't cost an not lot for us ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's because this technology is for limited wor or limited wor lexical recognition , it's very it's .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's no it's even for the because the vocabulary is very small , so that's not problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because then you need this doesn't have the power to do recognition , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "you have also the language problem , when you 'cause it have to be universal , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "agree with , but there is one problem that baba talked about is the international remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we need something that is international .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "suppose we're we want to sell it in france .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the recognition system will be able to understand french .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you want to go to england , it will be able to understand english , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the key , the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some adaptation mechanism .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "this could be downloaded by the web , or .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the product the pro it's very smart , it's very smart controller .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's it means when you sell this controller in china it's can recognise chinese .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's if you sell this controller in france it can recognise french .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's because of this product this technology has already been developed .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but the problem is how to if this is push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but how will you .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you have the language , you have to develop for each country .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "tha that's why we have to do language adaptation .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but for each country you have to do one , because the for se really ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "even for each for even for different family we have to do we would we have to do adaptation to no , it's not so complex .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "that's comple microphone .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but then , we have to take care of the twelve euros problem .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "seems to be quite complex .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and where will be they ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "do you we're far from television it will work ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no it's not that's not problem because you don't have to wear microphone .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it just the microphone is embedded in the controller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but where is the controller ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "where is the controller ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's in your family , in your home .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , but then it's like this .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but we're here it's an object .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but here you say you want to use technology .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you can embed it microphone here .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have remote control li like this , if you have an object .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to talk to the t_v_ .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you just want to interact with television .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just you just put the controller here , then you use your command and you do your gesture .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "if you say one , he switch to channel , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you can lose it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no it's if you lose it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so if it is somewhere in the room if it is in the table there you can always say channel one and the remote control gives the order to the t_v_ to switch to channel one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you so you can build black box and put it on t_v_ and just to recognize gestures and voice .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but so you need camera and microphone inside your remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you would still have the buttons .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or is it do you should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "or you still have the possibility to use buttons ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it we should give the flexibility to the user and we .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you can see they can switch form one modality to another .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's bit risky .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "no , that's quite inter quite attractive .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "and it will be quite .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but that , switching from one country to another will be problem , so although but , we should .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we should have confidence in technology .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "so , what do you think ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll try the controllers you'd prefer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "which controller would you prefer to use , you as remote control user ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if , i'm if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "more features , .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but if it like doubles no one would be interested .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but he need control that is very reliable , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the google controller or fancy controller .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "try to mix the google controller and the fancy controller ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "just want to have something controller which is in intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but if you stick to the first two parts .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you t's possible ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "there's no features of our controller , so is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "no , but you need new remote controller then .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would you replace your controller with similar function if you do not have some function inside it that , you that's fun that's not the function of the controller , that's function of t_v_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "it's not really the we can add some function like for browsing in internet , so like that .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but user need don't have the if we can send email from it .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you can replace your t_v_ with new t_v_ with internet browsing function , but .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because if you wanna browse internet or , if you wanna type something , or no .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it's also the issue of the t_v_ .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "because the problem see with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in family if and for all the person of the family , so , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but we do we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to use the controller , but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but we want so , but we want something that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you wou you would true .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's feature to distinguish our product from our from other products .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": ", if you're if you ar if you already have product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you don't need to tune it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the goo you say we would to have google-like controller .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "if it's not too expensive too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because you have new ye .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like google .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "google is simple , works fine , so if can have remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already lot .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "yes , but there's no big difference between the traditional controller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "thi this , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition or if he has something that works fine and is really fancy , looks and it's easy to use , easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the then nn no .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "tha but the there's not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with new one if there's no key feature in the new controller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "see that's the problem , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's the same .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "t's more interesting to develop remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product and so .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "that's the point .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so let's go to the industrial designer .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "we'll be able to take decision after that , so .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "participant two , working design , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so can you go to the next one ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's not this one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's oth the oth so it's the working design .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's there's something wrong with your you record it somewhere else .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so this is the described use what ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "are you inst don't .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it did didn't receive it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "didn't receive it .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "record recorded directly on the computer .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it seems that we have problem with the , so no , it will be more interesting to start with .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "if you remember what you had to say or it's more interesting what he says , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "say it to you without .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we can first come to frahan .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "with frahan , then you can prepare your slides , then present it later .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "you will had some more information in it will be interesting after your presentation to have baba's presentation .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": ", because in my presentation don't have here with so it was the design use to show you the design of what is inside what is inside and what are the different component of the remote control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so it will be interesting so could show you some picture of what is inside and so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the something want to discuss is which material are we going to use , so will it will be wooden di wooden remote control or plastic remote control like this one .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so and in which kind will be the different bu button , so it can be some , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like where , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , or , you can see them in the darkness .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the other thing want to discuss also is which alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be solar energy alimentation or will it be battery like the classical battery so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and that for the alimentation it would be good to have both of them , so in some country where you are in the countryside and you are far from , the cities in some place in senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come and so it can be interesting for people to have this remote con it can be something interesting to make people buy it , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's an added value to the remote control and it can attract all the ecological consumers and but about the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , no ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "alrigh , having them both will if we want to have battery , regular battery and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add little bit of the price , but it will be an added value also that will be compensated , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and what tha what about the materials ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and the materials , it depends you if you have wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common it's very resistant but , something wooden will be like , high cl so special high class , or , you can have some , even if it is not completely wood , but just part of the , will be wooden , in wood and it can be interesting .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and if you we want to put fashion in electronics we can try to do something with wood .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "seems to be interesting , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and so the last point is also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or very expensive , it depends , but that low level will be , it is an interim module .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "we want something easy to use and so something very low level wou would be enough .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and you think that we will be .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve euros , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and what about the buttons ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "the buttons pr prefer , the lighted buttons because , it's , in the dark , it's fashion and it's related to how beautiful it is or if you want to watch t_v_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your remote control that is lost , in the darkness it's very easy so , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "no it's fashion , .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "what about the touch scr touch screen ?", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "touch screen will be as expensive as the buttons so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but and it is other design , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it can also be interesting to have this .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you got email ?", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "we have only five minutes left .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no , trend watching .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the other one .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so , just , so just to meet the user requirements would just do short anal analysis of the remote control market and to have better overview of what's the fashion in general i've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so again , it's similar to what i've said in the previous meeting .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "user really want fancy look and feel .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "they're not so interested in functional look and feel , .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "like the one you've shown , david , with all the buttons and it sounds good technically but it's not what they want and so , second point is they still want it to be technologically innovative , so it's related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "at the same time , it's important that it's easy to use .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so that were the three first points from the remote control analysis .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "now if we look at fashion in general .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "wha what we really see this year is that everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is inspired by fruits and vegetables , so we really have to take this into account for the design of the thing .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "'cause it's really what people want .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and then if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on score of seven would have six as importance .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "then easy to use it's not so important actually with respect to other ones .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "so we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion from milan and paris we go to the fruits and vede vegetables .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and fruit and vegetables .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "and the other point haven't mention is people wan want to have spongy touch , so this is this doesn't really fit with the wooden design .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but the problem is which material do you need to be spongy ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "thi this is this would be like plastic-like , but rubber , mayb , rubber-like device , so , tha that was the main point , from the trend in fashion .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "pla very , rubber desi , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , as you say you want something technologically innovative , using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , will attract pro-ecology consumers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so when it's .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "it will be .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "cheap imprint so you propose low level chips would be enough to have something working .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you think case .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "someth no wood .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no wood but plastic ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "not no wood , but ma not the part you touching .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "would some we can have wood in the bottom and , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you it's natural .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it depends on the design we want , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "it's natural and it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , saying that it's ecol , it's not , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the feeling is natural , so we can stay with wood .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it's not exactly for the spongy point of view .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "but it's still fashion .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but we could have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , or .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "something that you can into it .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and what about the user interface concept ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "google and fancy , how about the voice ?", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "google and fancy ?", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "because that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested and how it is an interesting concept to see to have voice control .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "the smart controller .", "speaker": "C"}, {"text": "but and the problem is i'm we can infer if you have voice control why not to put it directly on the t_v_ , so speak directly to the t_v_ and you don't need remote control actually , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "but you need receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "but it will be embedded on the t_v_ and not on the remote control , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so we'll just focus on the google controller plus the fancy controller , try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not too difficult to add .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and pf what can we think supplement to the supplement can be the voice .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "for the interface something added value .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "it is just , it is not the most important , but it can be part of , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "you mean the remote control with mur module if you want you can just use commands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "to push button , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "even it is for just some kids , switching channels one two three four .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "turning the t_v_ on or off .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "not very complex commands , but easy commands , so .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so , adding some vocal commands .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "simple ones for expensive buttons , to make some new .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we'll you will all have to work in your direction .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the simple vocal commands recognition .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "you will have to work more , baba , on the spongy way to add spongy touch to the buttons and try to find shape for the wooden remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and sup we'll have to evaluate the product too .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends .", "speaker": "D"}, {"text": "and remember as said last meeting , we really have to build fashion remote control and the colour of the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "need it to be , .", "speaker": "B"}, {"text": "so you will have baba and david jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us modelling cl clay remote control , so you will have to model something .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "and that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "so , no more questions , we can close the session .", "speaker": "A"}, {"text": "sounds good , .", "speaker": "B"}], "id": "xxxxx",
